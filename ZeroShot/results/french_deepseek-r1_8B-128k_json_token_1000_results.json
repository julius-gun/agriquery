It also states that it's possible to close two out of three dosage openings so that the desired flow can be precisely regulated with minimal risk of blockage.\n\nWait, but the question is about how many dosing openings are closed during fine application. From the context, I see that two of the three orifices can be closed. So, that means one remains open while two are closed. Therefore, the number of closed dosing openings during fine application is two.\n</think>\n\nTwo dosing openings are closed during fine application.",

If the transmission is full when parking, the machine might become unstable. It also notes that the wheels aren't designed for heavy loads and can cause damage to the machine, potentially leading to injuries.\n\nFurther down, there are some ListItems with emojis and text instructions in French.

One of them is immobilisant une machine mobile lors de l'attelage au tracteur, which translates to immobilizing a mobile machine during attachment to the tractor.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about the parking brake. The context doesn't explicitly mention the parking brake. Instead, it talks about ensuring parts are positioned correctly and following procedures. There's also a point about using a lifting device conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation, which is in line with regulations.\n\nSo, while the context emphasizes safety during attachment, like immobilizing the machine and following procedures, there's no direct mention of engaging the parking brake specifically. Therefore, I can't confirm that the parking brake should be engaged before attaching the machine based on this context.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not explicitly state whether the parking brake should be engaged before connecting the machine. It focuses on ensuring parts are positioned correctly and following procedures for safe attachment.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context is a section from a document, probably a manual or technical guide, discussing aspects related to tractors and transmission trees. The key terms here are \"arbre de transmission,\" which translates to transmission tree or coupling shaft in English.\n\nLooking at the text items, I see that there's a mention of the transmission tree needing to be adjusted to the correct length before attaching it to the tractor. This suggests that the length is crucial for proper function. However, I don't immediately see any specific numbers related to angles here.\n\nThere are some bullet points listed as \"ListItems,\" which provide instructions on checking and securing the transmission tree and coupling shaft. These include items like ensuring there's no pollution or damage, checking connections, sliding the coupling piece onto the transmission tree, releasing the lock, etc. None of these directly mention angles.\n\nI also notice a reference to another section on page 50 about the length of the coupling shaft and a reduction in transmission tree length on page 51. This indicates that while there's information on length adjustments, there's nothing specific about operating angles here.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide any numerical values or specific instructions regarding the permissible angle for operation when lifted or lowered, I can't extract an exact figure from it. Therefore, based on the given information, the answer should be \"Unknown\" because the required details aren't present in the provided text.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the maximum permissible operating angle for the coupling shaft when lifted or lowered.\n\n**Answer:** Unknown",

It mentions operations before irrigation and talks about avoiding blockages or water loss by using certain practices.\n\nLooking at the specific parts, there's a section titled \"Operations avant l'\u00e9pandage\" which translates to Operations Before Irrigation. Within this, it lists several points. One of them is: \"\\u00b7 Ne laissez jamais l'engrais pendant longtemps dans l'\\u00e9pandeur.\" This means not leaving the granular material for a long time in the irrigation tank.\n\nAnother important point is about cleaning the hopper and other components after each use. Then, it goes into details about filling the hopper up to a certain level. It mentions that if you don't need operations above the tr\u00e9mie (which I think refers to the loading platform), the height can be adjusted according to the automatic filling system.\n\nThen there's a specific instruction: \"Si au cours du remplissage, qu'il soit manuel ou avec de grands sacs, la distance entre le bord de la tr\u00e9mie et le sol est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1250 mm, il vous faut utiliser une plateforme de chargement.\" Translating this, it says that if during loading (manual or with large bags), the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm, a loading platform must be used.\n\nSo, putting this together, when manually loading, if the distance from the hopper rim to the ground exceeds 1250 mm, a platform is required.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: \"After disengaging the PTO shaft, what poses a continued danger and why?\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the context provided. The context is in French, but I can understand it because some words are in English or common terms. Let me go through each item carefully.\n\nThe context starts with two TextItems saying \"Utilisation dans les champs,\" which translates to \"Usage in fields.\" Then there's a PictureItem with an empty caption, so maybe just an image without text. \n\nNext, there's a SectionHeaderItem: \"Coincement entre des pi\u00e8ces en mouvement :\". That seems like it's talking about connections between moving parts. The following TextItems are important:\n\n1. \"Faites attention ne pas vous coincer entre les pi\u00e8ces en mouvement lors des op\u00e9rations de r\u00e9glage.\" This translates to \"Be careful not to get caught between moving pieces during adjustment operations.\"\n2. \"Ne commencez les op\u00e9rations sur la machine que lorsque toutes les pi\u00e8ces de la machine sont arrang\u00e9es et que les manettes de commande sont \u00e0 l'abri de toute fausse manoeuvre.\" This means, \"Do not start operations on the machine until all parts are arranged and the control levers are protected from any faulty maneuver.\"\n3. \"Portez des chaussures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des gants protecteurs et travaillez seul. Vous pouvez gravement vous blesser si vous vous coincez.\" This says, \"Wear safety shoes and protective gloves and work alone. You can seriously hurt yourself if you get caught.\"\n\nThen there's another SectionHeaderItem: \"Contr\u00f4lez l'environnement direct.\" Which means \"Control the immediate environment.\" The following TextItems are:\n\n1. \"Contr\u00f4lez et surveillez en permanence l'environnement direct au d\u00e9but et au cours des op\u00e9rations effectu\u00e9es avec et sur la machine. Assurez-vous d'avoir une vue d\u00e9gag\u00e9e sur l'environnement direct.\" This translates to \"Continuously monitor and control the immediate environment at the start and during operations performed on and with the machine. Make sure you have a clear view of the immediate environment.\"\n2. \"Veillez \u00e0 ce que personne (vous y compris) ne se trouve dans la zone de travail et dans la zone dangereuse lorsque la machine fonctionne.\" This means, \"Make sure that no one (including yourself) is in the work area or dangerous zone while the machine is operating.\"\n\nFinally, there's a SectionHeaderItem: \"Avant de quitter le tracteur, vous devez\" which translates to \"Before leaving the tractor, you must...\" followed by several ListItems:\n\n1. D\u00e9sbrayer la prise de force (disengage the PTO shaft)\n2. Mettre hors pression le syst\u00e8me hydraulique (bleed the hydraulic system)\n3. D\u00e9brancher le syst\u00e8me de commande \u00e9lectronique (disconnect the electronic control system)\n4. Couper le contact sur le tracteur (cut the tractor's power)\n5. Retirer la cl\u2026 (remove the clutch)\n\nWait, the last ListItem seems cut off: \"Retirer la cl\u2026\" which might be \"Retirer la cl\u00e9\" (remove the key) or something else, but it's incomplete.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about disengaging the PTO shaft. The context mentions that after disconnecting the PTO shaft, there are continued dangers. Specifically, getting caught between moving parts is a risk because the machine can still operate and move dangerous components. Also, not having a clear view of the environment could lead to accidents if someone is nearby.\n\nSo, putting it together: After disengaging the PTO shaft, the continued danger is that the operator might get caught between moving pieces due to the machine's movement. Additionally, not having a clear view of the surroundings can result in injuries if someone else is near.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, the continued danger is that the operator could be caught between moving parts due to the machine's operation, potentially leading to serious injury. Additionally, without a clear view of the environment, others might be at risk within the work area or dangerous zone.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about the approach using the GEOCONTROL function being deactivated. It mentions that when the hopper content is below 100 kg, the system automatically stops sampling. The precision of the measurement decreases to the point where another automatic sampling isn't sufficient to establish a better flow curve. For very low rates below 50 kg/ha, it's possible to lower the minimum content in the hopper.\n\nSo, putting this together, when the hopper content is below 100 kg, the system automatically stops sampling because the precision isn't enough for accurate measurements anymore. This affects the ability to establish a good flow curve. Additionally, for even lower contents below 50 kg/ha, further adjustments can be made by lowering the minimum hopper content.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only including the specific information related to the question and nothing extra. The key points are that automatic sampling stops when it's below 100 kg and that precision decreases, making another sample unnecessary. Also, for lower than 50 kg/ha, more adjustments can be made.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the system automatically stops sampling due to insufficient precision for accurate measurements, affecting the ability to establish a reliable flow curve. For contents below 50 kg/ha, further adjustments may be possible by lowering the minimum hopper content.\n\nAnswer: The system automatically stops sampling when hopper content is below 100 kg due to decreased precision, and further adjustments can be made for lower contents.",

It mentions \"Utilisation dans les champs\" which translates to \"Use in fields.\" Then there's a section about \"Epandage de bordure,\" which means \"Border spreading.\"\n\nLooking further, it says that border spreading requires specific attention. On one hand, you want a full dose right after the border for good yield. On the other hand, you want to minimize losses from the other side of the field border.\n\nNext, it talks about the spreader having two different ways to work and corresponding adaptations for border spreading. The list items mention \"Epandage unilat\u00e9ral en bordure \u00e0 l'aide du deflecteur de bordure hydraulique\" which translates to \"Unilateral spreading along the border using a hydraulic border deflector,\" and \"Epandage des bordures avec ExactLine,\" meaning \"Border spreading with ExactLine.\"\n\nThen, it explains how each method works. For unilateral spreading along the border, you go along the field's edge and spread into the field starting from there. For border spreading, you start in the first row of pulverization from the field's edge and spread towards the field's edge.\n\nIt also recommends first spreading on the field before doing so on the borders. During border spreading, the system doesn't automatically measure or adjust settings precisely, leading to potential differences in application rate compared to desired.\n\nSo, focusing on the functions: The context mentions two methods of border spreading\u2014unilateral along the border and using ExactLine. Each method serves a specific purpose: one ensures maximum dose right after the border, and the other minimizes losses from the other side.\n\nTherefore, the two functions are:\n1. Unilateral spreading along the border.\n2. Spreading with ExactLine.\n</think>\n\nThe two functions for border spreading are:\n\n1. **Unilateral spreading along the border**, achieved using a hydraulic border deflector.\n2. **Spreading with ExactLine** technology.\n\nAnswer: The two functions for border spreading are unilat\u00e9ral en bordure and des bordures avec ExactLine.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is M18, which refers to its diameter measurement. The \"M\" stands for metric, so it's not an inch-based size. The number 18 indicates the diameter in millimeters, so this bolt has a diameter of 18mm.\n\nNext, the quality is 10.9. I remember that in bolts, the quality or grade refers to strength properties. A 10.9 grade means the bolt can withstand up to 10.9 million psi (pounds per square inch) without breaking. This is important because it tells me about the bolt's strength.\n\nNow, the friction coefficient is given as 0.13. Friction in this context relates to the torque needed to loosen or tighten the bolt. A higher friction coefficient means more torque is required to overcome it. So a 0.13 coefficient isn't too high, which might mean moderate torque needs.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with various columns that seem to relate to different torque values for different types of bolts and couplings. The rows under each column are labeled with numbers like \"M5\", \"M6\", up to \"M24\". These likely correspond to bolt diameters.\n\nThe specific row I'm interested in is \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10.\" which translates to something like \"Couple of nuts for 4.6.0,10.\" I think this refers to a coupling or nut type used with the bolt. The numbers after that (like 10.) might indicate the specific model or size of the coupling.\n\nLooking at the data under \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10.\", each number corresponds to a torque value in Nm. The first entry is \"1,7\", which I assume is for M5 bolts. Since we're dealing with an M18 bolt, I need to find the 18th entry in this row.\n\nCounting down from the first entry (which is M5), each subsequent number corresponds to a larger diameter. So, M5 is 0, M6 is 1, and so on up to M24 at position 10. Therefore, M18 would be the 18th entry minus one because we start counting from 0.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the context provided, the \"Qualit\\u00e9.Friction *.Filetage\" column lists from M5 (index 0) up to M24 (index 10). So for each row under \"Couples de serrage...\", the index corresponds to the bolt diameter. Therefore, M18 would be at index 17 because it's the 18th item starting from M5.\n\nLooking back at the context, the row for \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10.\" has entries from index 0 to 10. So I need to find the value at index 17 in this row. However, the provided data only goes up to index 9 (for M24). This might mean that the table doesn't have data for all sizes, or perhaps it's truncated.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list out the indices:\n\n0: M5\n1: M6\n2: M8\n3: M10\n4: M12\n5: M14\n6: M16\n7: M18\n8: M20\n9: M22\n10: M24\n\nSo, for \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10.\", the torque values are:\n\n0: 1,7\n1: 3\n2: 8\n3: 16\n4: 27\n5: 42\n6: 65\n7: 90\n8: 125\n9: 170\n10: 210\n\nWait, that's only up to M24 at index 10. So for M18, which is index 7, the torque value is 90 Nm.\n\nBut wait, in the context provided, the \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10.\" row has data from index 0 to 10, but the user's question is about an M18 bolt, which would be at index 7 (since M5 is 0). So the torque value should be 90 Nm.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that this table corresponds correctly. The context mentions \"Couples de serrage acier\" and various types of couplings or nuts. It's possible that each row in the table corresponds to a specific coupling type, and the numbers under each index are for different bolt sizes.\n\nGiven that, and considering that M18 is at index 7, the",

        "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and with a 0.2 friction be fastened?",
        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part of this question means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is an M6, which refers to its size. M stands for metric, and 6 indicates the diameter in millimeters. So, an M6 bolt has a diameter of 6mm. Stainless steel bolts are often used because they're durable and resistant to corrosion, which makes sense given the context.\n\nNext, the quality is 70 (A2). I'm not entirely sure what this means exactly. I know that A2 refers to a standard for stainless steel, indicating specific mechanical properties. The number 70 might be related to tensile strength or yield strength. Maybe it's the minimum tensile strength? I think in some standards, like ISO, A2-70 refers to a tensile strength of around 70 MPa (which is 7000 kPa). So, I'll assume that the 70 (A2) quality means the bolt has a tensile strength of about 70 MPa.\n\nThen there's the friction coefficient of 0.2. Friction in bolts is important because it affects how much torque is needed to prevent the bolt from loosening over time. A higher friction coefficient means more torque is required, while a lower one means less. So, with a 0.2 coefficient, we'll need enough torque to account for that.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with various columns like \"Qualit\\u00e9.Friction *.Filetage\" and different rows under it. Each row seems to correspond to a specific M size bolt, from M5 up to M24. The numbers in the rows are likely the torque values in Nm required for each size.\n\nI need to find the row that corresponds to an M6 bolt with 70 (A2) quality and a friction coefficient of 0.2. Let me look through the context again. There's a section titled \"Couples de serrage acier\" which translates to something like steel coupling or maybe bolts. Then there are TextItems mentioning maintenance and directives for couplings.\n\nLooking at the table, each key under \"Qualit\\u00e9.Friction *.Filetage\" seems to be the M size of the bolt. For example, \"M5\", \"M6\", up to \"M24\". The corresponding values are numbers in Nm. So, for each M size, there's a specific torque value.\n\nI need to find the row where the key is \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10.\" and \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,13.\". Wait, that might not be directly helpful. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table, under each M size, there are two sets of numbers: one for 10 and another for 13. Maybe these represent different standards or specifications, like ISO 6801 or something similar. The first number after \"Couples de serrage\" might be a code for the standard.\n\nSo, for M6, the key is \"M6\", and under that, there are two sets of numbers: one starting with \"10.\" and another with \"13.\". These likely represent different torque values based on the standard. So, I need to figure out which one applies here.\n\nGiven that the question mentions a 0.2 friction coefficient, I think it's referring to the general case, so maybe the lower of the two? Or perhaps the higher one because it accounts for the friction. Wait, no, torque required is usually based on the applied torque minus the frictional torque. So, if the applied torque is X Nm and the frictional torque is Y Nm, then the net torque needed would be (X - Y). But in this context, I think the numbers provided are already considering the friction.\n\nWait, looking at the table again, for M6, under \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10.\", the values start with 1,7; 3; 8; etc. And under \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,13.\", it starts with 2; 4; 9; etc.\n\nI think these numbers are the torque in Nm required for each M size, considering different factors like the friction coefficient and the bolt's properties. So, for an M6 bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient, I need to find which of these two sets applies.\n\nIf \"4.6.0\" refers to a specific standard or test method, perhaps ISO 4.6-0, then the numbers under \"10.\" and \"13.\" are for different conditions. Maybe \"10.\" is for a lower torque application",

From the context provided, it seems like this method involves covering 100% of a field's edge with some kind of spread, possibly using tools and settings on machinery.\n\nLooking at the context, there are mentions of \"unilat\u00e9ral en bordure\" which translates to one-sided border spreading. It talks about how this method can cover the entire edge by using a deflector, ensuring that 100% coverage is achieved along the borders of fields or gardens. \n\nNow, considering small gardens, I need to see if this method is applicable. The context mentions that for most types of fertilizers, a triangular shape with complete coverage can be\u9884\u671f (expected) over about 60% of the working width. This suggests that it's efficient and works well when applied correctly.\n\nHowever, I should also think about practicality. In small gardens, maneuvering large machinery might be challenging. But the context doesn't mention any limitations based on garden size, only on the type of fertilizer or application method.

Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about maintenance and some specific points related to it. One part mentions that the rate of corrosion is influenced by factors like the type of fertilizer or additive used. It specifically says that fertilizers and other salages can significantly affect corrosion rates. \n\nI'm trying to find information that directly compares coastal vs. inland regions. The context doesn't explicitly state whether coastal areas have higher or lower corrosion rates due to environmental factors like salt exposure or humidity. Instead, it focuses on the impact of agricultural inputs like fertilizers.\n\nSo, while there's mention of corrosion being influenced by external factors (like the environment), the exact comparison between coastal and inland regions isn't provided. The context talks about maintaining the machine properly to reduce corrosion but doesn't specify differences based on location.\n\nTherefore, I don't have enough information in the given text to answer how the corrosion rate compares between coastal and inland areas. It seems like the context is more focused on general maintenance tips rather than regional differences.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

In this section, it mentions that when cleaning the machine, you can come into contact with certain products. It specifically advises wearing protective clothing, such as protective gloves, safety shoes, and protective glasses.\n\nNext, looking at the part about \"Risque d'explosion li\u00e9 au nitrate\" (Risk of explosion due to nitrate), it talks about fertilizers based on nitrate exploding when exposed to fire. It suggests avoiding all residues near orifices, angles, couplings, and flexible parts before welding, cutting, or modifying the machine.\n\nThen there's a section on \"Pr\u00e9vention de tout fonctionnement accidentel\" (Preventing accidental operation), which mentions protecting pieces with potential energy reserves and components like compressed air, hydraulics, and electricity. It also advises turning off systems and separating conduits and cables to prevent accidents.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about cleaning fertilizer remnants before welding. The context doesn't explicitly mention Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD, but it does discuss wearing protective gloves when dealing with dangerous products during cleaning. Since fertilizers can be hazardous, especially nitrate-based ones, the relevant protective gear includes gloves.\n\nSo, the specific information needed is that protective gloves are required for this task.\n</think>\n\nProtective gloves are necessary for cleaning fertilizer remnants before welding on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD.",

Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section about \"Apprendre \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la machine\" which translates to \"Learning about the machine.\" Then there's information on \"Tracteur ISOBUS,\" which is \"ISOBUS Tractor,\" and \"Tracteur avec IsoMatch,\" meaning \"Tractor with IsoMatch.\"\n\nLooking further, I find a section titled \"Transformation du tracteur en tracteur ISOBUS avec faisceau IsoMatch Power.\" That translates to \"Converting the tractor into an ISOBUS tractor with IsoMatch Power.\" There are also some PictureItems without captions, which might be images related to the topics.\n\nNext, there's a TextItem that says \"32,\" which could refer to page number 32 or perhaps a model number. Then another section about \"Raccordement sur un tracteur ISOBUS,\" meaning \"Connection on an ISOBUS tractor.\" The following TextItems discuss functions like distribution and data transfer passing through ISOBUS between the tractor's terminal or control block and the machine.\n\nOne important point is that communication via ISOBUS allows specifically handling the location and reacting to anomalies in the field shape and soil composition. Additionally, with GPS and various sensors, necessary information is communicated to optimally direct the machine.\n\nThere's a section about \"Fonctionnalit\u00e9s ISOBUS via IsoMatch,\" which translates to \"ISOBUS functionalities via IsoMatch.\" It mentions that tractors without their own ISO terminal can function using the IsoMatch control block as an ISO tractor.\n\nAnother section, \"Signal de vitesse, de r\u00e9gime de prise de force et GPS sur IsoMatch,\" talks about speed and power regime signals on IsoMatch. It states that if the machine isn't measuring speed via its own sensors but through the tractor's electronics, the speed sensor and cable adapter for signal recovery are connected to IsoMatch.\n\nNow, considering the question about detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS versions compatible with IsoMatch Tellus, I need to extract exact information. From the context, I don't see specific details about protocol versions or their respective specs like baud rates or maximum data transfer speeds. The context mentions communication via ISOBUS for functions like distribution and data transfer but doesn't specify the versions.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of different ISOBUS versions with their technical details in the provided text, I can't extract that information.

There's also a section about data storage, including documents, tractor data, parcel data, specific ISOBUS machine data, and client-specific data.\n\nThen there are some TextItem entries that talk about the main switch, how to connect or disconnect the control panel, and maintaining it each time the tractor is left. It also mentions that when the control panel is on, certain functions can be accidentally activated in a dangerous area, and the panel consumes current, which drains the tractor battery.\n\nAnother TextItem says after demoting, the screen shows the last two selected adaptations.

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section titled \"Operations before irrigation.\" Then, under that, it mentions that most fertilizers absorb water and can form blocks. These blocks can cause clogging at the irrigation point or emptying the nappe of irrigation.\n\nThere are several bullet points:\n1. If conditions are humid, only use a well-sealed roller compacted.\n2. Never irrigate without a roller compacted when conditions are humid.\n3. Don't leave fertilizer in the irrigation system for a long time because blocks can form due to air humidity.\n4. Clean the irrigation system thoroughly after each use, including orifices and flow control devices.\n\nThen, it talks about adjusting the irrigation system and filling it up to the desired level. It mentions that the machine should be loaded when it's 10 cm above the ground. If manual operations aren't needed above the roller compacted, the height can be adjusted based on the automatic filling system.\n\nFurther down, there's a mention of using a loading platform if the distance from the edge of the roller compacted to the soil is more than 1250 mm. The paragraph number 36 talks about technical characteristics, and another point says to bring the machine to the loading platform if it's fixed.

Another instruction is about maintaining a distance between the plate and the tractor's center. There's also mention of opening the dosage unit a few meters before passing over the first basin.\n\nNow, the question specifically asks about the 'tap' material used for the hydraulic border spreading plate. I'm trying to recall if any part of the context refers to materials or components called 'taps.' In agricultural machinery, taps are often related to hydraulic systems\u2014like where hoses connect or where pressure is regulated.\n\nLooking through the ListItems again, one stands out: \"D\u00e9marrerez le tracteur, embrayez la prise de force.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context is in French, but I can understand the key points. It's about preparing a machine for transportation. There are several steps mentioned, like checking regulations, lighting, warnings, brakes, and hydraulic cables. Then it talks about adding supplementary lighting and warning signs. Next, it mentions controlling removable parts and verifying their locking mechanisms, specifically listing things like the hood (jupe), ExactLine, and a hydraulically controlled side mirror.\n\nAfter that, there's a section on adjusting all machine and tractor components, particularly focusing on the power takeoff, hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical systems while in transport position. It also mentions checking weight distribution between the front and rear axles, possibly adding front weights, verifying maximum height, lowering the lifting device optionally, and securing the control panel of the lifting device to prevent accidental lowering.\n\nNow, looking for tire pressure specifically. I don't see any direct mention of tire pressure in this context. The focus is more on mechanical checks, safety features, and adjustments for transport readiness rather than specific pressure values. There's no reference to inflating tires or setting a particular pressure range here.\n\nSo, since the question asks about the recommended tire pressure range but there's no information provided in the context regarding that, I should respond that it's not found.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context is in French, but I can understand the technical terms. It mentions \"dispersion d'engrais\" which translates to seed dispersion or distribution. The key part here is about how to spread the seeds evenly along the border of a field.\n\nThere are two methods mentioned for border spreading: unilat\u00e9ral and with ExactLine. For unilat\u00e9ral, you drive along the edge and spread into the field starting from the border. For ExactLine, you go through the first row of pulverization starting from the field's edge and spread towards it.\n\nThe important point is that during border spreading, the system can't automatically adjust the settings to get the right dosage. So, if you apply too much or too little, the application rate might not be as desired.\n\nNow, the question is about the optimal speed reduction percentage needed to compensate for the application rate. The context doesn't directly mention a specific percentage but talks about minimizing losses and ensuring proper distribution by adjusting how you spread the seeds.\n\nI think the key here is that you need to adjust your driving speed so that you apply the right amount without over or under applying. Since it's about compensation, maybe reducing the speed helps in distributing the seeds more evenly. However, there's no exact percentage given, just methods on how to do it.\n\nSo, based on the context, I can't extract a specific percentage but understand that adjusting the spreading method and possibly the speed is necessary for proper application.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the material of the 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section labeled \"maintenance\" with several steps. One of these steps is about removing the metal seal rings: \"\\uf034 Retirez les 3 boulons de fixation des bagues d'\\u00e9tanch\\u00e9it\\u00e9.\" Translating that, it says \"Remove the 3 fixing bolts from the metal seal rings.\"\n\nWait, so they're referring to \"metal seal rings\" here. That suggests that these rings are made of metal. There's also a mention of replacing them with new ones later: \"\\uf034 Placez \\u00e0 nouveau les bagues d'\\u00e9tanch\\u00e9it\\u00e9 m\\u00e9talliques.\" Which translates to \"Place the new metal seal rings.\"\n\nSo both when removing and replacing, they specify that these are metal. There's no mention of any other materials like plastic or rubber in this context. The term used is \"m\u00e9talliques,\" which means metallic or made of metal.\n\nTherefore, the material of the 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal is metal.\n</think>\n\nThe material of the 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal is **metal**.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the specific extension cable length in meters that's optimal for an ISO 11786 connection in a tractor. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several items listed on page 144. The first section is \"Accessoires,\" which includes a cable with 7-pin connectors for ISO 11786 inside the tractor cab. Then there's an entry about the IsoMatch Tellus input, which mentions that it can be connected using a specific connector provided as standard with an extension cable option.\n\nFurther down, under \"Juste apr\u00e9s le c\u00e2ble de raccordement ISO 11786 dans la cabine,\" it says to mount on the 7-pin connector of the ISO 11786 cable, which is provided in standard with an optional extension cable towards the tractor connection. It also mentions that this setup allows connecting either the speed sensor or radar directly to the IsoMatch Tellus box.\n\nI'm looking for information about the length of the extension cable. The context doesn't explicitly state a specific length. It only mentions that an extension cable is available as an option and that it's provided in standard with the 7-pin connector. There's no numerical value given, so I can't extract a precise number from this text.\n\nSince there's no exact measurement provided, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe specific extension cable length for ISO 11786 in the tractor connection isn't detailed in the context provided.\n\n**Answer:** Not found in context.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how long the free test period is for the GEOCONTROL software user license. Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see there's a section about IsoMatch Shop. It mentions that after the evaluation period expires, you can buy a user license to use the machine. The text says \"once the free evaluation period has expired.\" Hmm, but it doesn't specify how many days are in that period.\n\nI also look at other parts of the context. There's information about IsoMatch Grip and how it complements the ISOBUS or ISOMatch equipment. But nothing there mentions the duration of the test period either.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The TextItem says: \"once the free evaluation period has expired.\" That's all. No numbers or details about days. So, the context doesn't provide specific information about how many days are in the test period for GEOCONTROL software.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the duration of the free test period for the GEOCONTROL software user licence.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

        "question": "What valve type and manufacturer is used for 'valve set' that comes with hopper empty sensor?",
        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what valve type and manufacturer is used for the 'valve set' that comes with the hopper empty sensor. Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the context is in French, which might be a bit challenging, but I'll try to parse it. The main sections are about accessories, specifically mentioning \"Capteur de tr\u00e9mie vide\" and \"ExactLine\". \n\nLooking at the TextItem for \"Capteur de tr\u00e9mie vide\", it says that this sensor sets an alarm when the tramway is almost empty. It also mentions that the capteur is always provided with the drain kit. So, the capteur is part of the valve set that comes with the hopper empty sensor.\n\nNow, I need to determine if \"Capteur de tr\u00e9mie vide\" refers to a specific type of valve or if it's a component within a valve set. From the context, it seems like the capteur is a sensor, not necessarily a valve itself. However, since it's part of the valve set, I can infer that it's related to the control mechanism.\n\nThe other relevant section is about \"ExactLine\", which is described as a precision edge painting system using the last powderizing track. It mentions that ExactLine provides excellent coverage with optimal balance between performance and environment. However, this doesn't directly relate to valves but rather to the painting process.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of specific valve types or manufacturers in the context provided, I can only infer based on the information given. The capteur is a sensor that's part of the valve set, but without more details, I can't specify the exact type or manufacturer.\n</think>\n\nThe valve set includes a \"Capteur de tr\u00e9mie vide,\" which is a sensor used to detect when the tramway is nearly empty and triggers an alarm. However, specific valve types or manufacturers aren't detailed in the provided context.\n\nAnswer: The capteur de tr\u00e9mie vide is part of the valve set but doesn't specify the exact type or manufacturer.",

Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see there's a section about \"Container d'\u00e9talonnage\" on page 149. That translates to something like \"Calibration Container.\" The text mentions that a test for the flow rate is necessary for precise manual adjustment of the flow rate. It also says the calibration container is an essential tool for this purpose.\n\nThen, there's another section about \"Jeu de vidange,\" which means \"Drain Kit.\" This drain kit is optional and helps quickly remove residues from the hopper. The text specifically states that a drain kit is available as an option to eliminate residue from the hopper.\n\nNow, looking at the question again: it asks for the drain rate in liters per minute of the drain kit. I need to find if there's any specific information about the flow rate or how much it can drain per minute.\n\nIn the context provided, I don't see any direct numbers or specifications about the drain rate. The context talks about the necessity of a test for flow rate adjustment and mentions the drain kit's purpose but doesn't provide measurements like liters per minute.\n\nSince there's no specific data given about the drain rate in the context, I should respond that this information isn't found.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The relevant section headers mention \"Bouches\" (hopper covers) and specific types like \"Bouches \u00e9lectriques\" (electric hopper covers). There's also a mention of \"Tamis \u00e0 pellets\" (pellet conveyor).\n\nLooking at the TextItems, I find that the electric hopper cover uses a material called \"bouches \u00e9lectriques.\" It mentions that this material protects the grain in the hopper from moisture and pollution. Additionally, it can be folded to increase the loading opening size.\n\nI don't see any direct mention of sail material or specific materials used for the covers beyond what's related to their function. The context doesn't specify whether it's a particular type of fabric or sail material, so I'm unsure about that part.\n\nRegarding UV resistance, the text does talk about the electric hopper cover protecting against pollution and moisture but doesn't explicitly state anything about UV resistance. So, I can't confirm if it has good UV resistance based on this context.\n\nSince there's no specific information provided about the sail material or its UV properties, I should respond that the information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",
