     when doing boundary track spreading with the ExactLine (accessory). The flow of fertiliser granules, seeds or other granules spread with ExactLine. The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the ExactLine position.
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test the ExactLine therefore always in advance as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The (online) spreading charts indicate the correct setting for the ExactLine and the relevant rpm for the PTO shaft and the spreading discs.
If the settings of the ExactLine are not given in the relevant spreading chart they can be obtained in the following sources:
· find with the online spreading chart service on the website or via the Free Application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
 See paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
Always check the settings of the ExactLine by performing the test as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The type of fertiliser is determined when adjusting the spreader, as described in
 paragraph »Determine the type and pattern of the granules« on page 57.
you can choose from 3 settings from the chart:
· YIELD.
· ECO,
In the yield setting (YIELD), the loss over the field edge is higher than what is allowed by the environmental standard. Therefore, never use this setting next to surface water. Cover to the border is very good with this option.
The loss over the field edge will be equal to or less than the environment standard in the environment setting (ECO). Always use this setting when working next to a surface water! The result is that the cover at the border of the property is not optimum.

Use in the field
 Engage the ExactLine by letting the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve run for a few seconds. This is also how pressure is built in the accumulator. You will see the ExactLine symbol on the main screen. The symbol only appears when the ExactLine is in working position.
 Close the tap on the hydraulic hose to prevent the ExactLine from changing position while spreading due to a leaking tractor valve.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Do not change the settings of the spreader.
 See paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Set the ExactLine to the required position, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart.
 Start the tractor and set the correct PTO shaft and spreading discs RPM, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart or the chart on the previous page.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
 Continue operating the spreader in the same way as in full field spreading,
 See paragraph »Start spreading« on page 100.
 Check regularly while spreading to see if the symbol of the ExactLine remains on screen. If the symbol disappears the ExactLine is no longer in a good working position.
 Set the ExactLine back to transport mode after use by opening the tap in the hydraulic hose and then opening the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve for a few seconds.
The ExactLine's position is displayed on the main screen if you have connected this function.
 See the software instruction manual.
In this way, you will make fewer spreading errors caused by an incorrectly positioned ExactLine.
In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:
 Stop spreading immediately!
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 See then paragraph »Failure and stoppage« on page 113.

Causes
Use in the field
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
While working with the spreader, you might come into contact with fertiliser or other substances that you want to spread. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
During spreading, if you:
· see that a spreading disc is spreading irregularly or not at all while the dosing units are open,
· hear a loud noise,
· become aware that the machine is vibrating seriously,
· an alarm is shown on the main screen indicating that the PTO shaft is not connected, while it actually is connected,
· an alarm will appear on the main screen, indicating that the dosing units cannot be closed,
 see the software instruction manual.
Stop spreading immediately! Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!

INDICATION
These failures are probably caused by one of the following:
· a hard object blocks the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking the supply from flowing to the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking fertiliser from flowing through the dosing opening or discharge bushing,
· crushed and/or damp fertiliser forms an encrusted layer beneath the agitator and blocks the flow through the dosing openings,
· a lump of damp fertiliser has formed in the discharge bushing and is blocking flow from the discharge bushing opening. This happens especially when the spreader has not been thoroughly cleaned after it was last used.
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Handle with care
Cautiously approach the machine and handle with care. There could be hot or live parts! Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
To find the cause of the failure or stoppage and solve it as far as possible, proceed as follows.
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 Switch off the electronic control system.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the handbrake of the tractor.
Do not place the machine on the ground. Placing a filled machine on the ground damages the structure!<|begin_of_text|>

Use in the field
 Examine the spreading discs and the discharge opening to see what the cause of the failure/stoppage is.
 Adapt the discharge point as needed for easier access.
 If you still cannot see the cause, carefully remove the vanes to see better into the discharge opening of the discharge bushing.
 Pass an object such as a screwdriver through the discharge opening and carefully feel if you can find an object in or damage to the dosing openings or agitator.
If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The agitator is probably damaged too. You must first repair the damage or have it repaired before continuing with spreading.
 Place an object, for example a cloth or bag, in the discharge opening of the discharge bushing on the damaged side.. This will prevent you from wasting fertiliser during transport.
 Start the tractor and engage the control box. The dosing units will now close.
 Switch off the control box.
 Take all appropriate measures for road transport.
 See paragraph »Preparing the machine to be transported« on page 93.
On the site of a lockable storage depot:
 Empty the hopper without positioning the machine on the ground.
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
Lock the sieve in the open position
If you open the sieves, you should lock them to prevent unwanted closing. Accidental closure could lead to serious injury.
 Remove the object that caused the damage.
 Repair the machine or have your dealer do it.

If you have not found any damage, the failure is probably due to stoppage from an encrusted layer of fertiliser.
 Try to reduce the size of the lump or encrusted layer with an object such as a stick, screwdriver or vane.
If you open the filters to reduce the lump or encrusted layer from the top side, you should block them to prevent unwanted closing.
If you can reduce the lump or encrusted layer in this way:
 Inspect the hopper contents for other lumps and reduce them.
 Fit the vanes and secure them with the lock nut.
 Check the discharge point setting.
 Close the hopper cover.
 Continue spreading.
If you have not managed to reduce the lump or encrusted layer because it is out of reach or there is no tool at your disposal:
 Close the hopper cover.
 Follow the working method as described in the previous paragraph »Damage« until emptying the hopper.
 Remove or reduce the lump or encrusted layer.
 If necessary, dry the hopper and the dosing mechanism.
Opening the sieve clip
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
 Lock the sieve to prevent it from closing accidentally.
 Close the sieves and check the lock.
 Refill the spreader.
 Check the fertiliser for lumps before and after filling.
 Close the hopper cover.<|begin_of_text|>

Storing the machine
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
It is easy to come into contact with the materials when putting away the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protect the machine
Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan. After cleaning, inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with the supplied preserving liquid point for protection against corrosion of the
machine, read the instructions before use.
Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners
You can clean the machine with water or steam, possibly using only suitable cleaning tools. Also read here and adhere to the safety instructions of the material manufacturer.
 Only use low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.
 Keep the nozzle more than 30 cm clear of turning parts, sensors, parts of the electric system, hydraulic hoses, stickers and plastic parts.
 Only spray perpendicular to sticker edges.
Waste storage and disposal
The waste water from cleaning the machine is contaminated with fertiliser and possibly also with lubrications. Collect the waste and dispose of it in terms of national regulations.

It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.
The advantages of this working order are:
· additional checks on the machine right after work,
· ensuring the longevity of the machine,
· less delays due to problems while working with the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples.
 See paragraph »Lubricating points« on page 126.
 Clean the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples once again.
When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.
Furthermore, do not set up electrical components. Water can cause electrical failures.
