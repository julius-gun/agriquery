Remove the key from the ignition to prevent the tractor from being started unintentionally while you are in the danger zone. This especially applies when changing the settings or while maintenance and repairs are carried out.</text><text>Keep clear from a running machine</text><text>Fertiliser is spread over a great distance during operation. Ensure that nobody comes within working reach of the machine during operation. Do not come into the working area before all parts of the machine are standing still.</text><text>The power lift must only be operated outside of the danger zone</text><text>In the area between the tractor and the machine, there is a danger of being pinned down by the power lift. The power lift must therefore only be engaged from beyond the danger zone. Secure the tractor with the parking brake and wheel chocks to ensure it would not roll away.</text><text>Do not approach the machine until it has come to a complete standstill</text><text>The rotating parts of the machine never come to an immediate halt, they always wind down. The moving parts of a machine are not always visible. Do not approach the machine until all moving parts have come to a complete halt.</text><text>Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured machine</text><text>The machine or parts of the machine could accidentally fall due to waning pressure, for instance. Always place the machine on proper supports if you have to work under the machine!</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="9"><image /><image /><image /><image /><image /><image /><image /><text>Safety</text><image /><text>Only lift the machine at the lifting points</text><text>If a machine is being elevated, only attach it to the indicated lifting points. Never go underneath an elevated machine. Allow for any possible movements of the elevated machine, whether wanted or not.</text><text>Be careful of getting jammed or pinched</text><text>If the machine is engaged or operated unintentionally you could get struck in moving parts, which could lead to injury. Be extra alert when working in the vicinity of moving parts. Always keep in mind that the motor or parts of the machine could still be retaining some energy.</text><text>Read the user's manual</text><text>The instruction manual contains procedures for working correctly to ensure safe work, as well as dangers one could possibly encounter. Keep to these procedures as described and give due consideration to the safety measures in place!</text><text>Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars</text><text>Prevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working with higher pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.</text><text>Motor vehicles with limited speed (&lt;40 km/h), agricultural and forestry tractors and their trailers, as well as other vehicles, must be provided with an orange triangle with a red reflector at the rear in the form of a truncated triangle.</text><text>9</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="10"><text>Safety</text><text>Safety requirements</text><text>Intended use</text><text>Person</text><text>10</text><image /><text>This part contains all the requirements, everything that is not permitted and requirements for each form of usage, maintenance and reparation of the machine.</text><text>The chapters in the manual contain additional safety measures.</text><text>Knowledge of the safety regulations forms the basis for safety and proper usage of the machine.</text><text>Always follow the safety instructions. most accidents are avoidable.

Operating the machine from the tractor will keep you out of harm's way. Other people should not be in the immediate vicinity of the machine and the tractor. Those who are within the working area and the danger zone could be injured.</text><text>Check the immediate vicinity</text><text>Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.</text><text>Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.</text><text>Work with a closed cabin</text><text>Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.</text><text>Check the state of the tractor and machine</text><text>Only work with the tractor and machine if they are in good condition Always check that:</text><text>· all lighting, safety and warning provisions must be mounted correctly and be in good working condition,</text><text>· the lifting and pulling capabilities must be sufficient,</text><text> see paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines« on page 13,</text><text>· the tractor must be suitable for the machine, such as in the area of stability, engine capability, axle load and total weight,</text><text>· it is sufficient for the working with the machine and for transport.</text><text>Adhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or machine damage.</text><text> See the tractor's technical details.</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="13"><image /><text>Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines</text><text>Safety</text><image /><text>Put a fire extinguisher in place</text><text>Carry a fire extinguisher at all times, especially when operating in dry crop materials. This should be a multi-purpose ABC rated extinguisher with a 5 kg capacity, approved by the appropriate authority. Mount this on the tractor and/or on the machine.

The fertiliser falls on the turning spreading disc. The discharge point is determined by the opening in the discharge bushing behind the vanes. This means that the fertiliser granules are already turning before they come into contact with the vanes on the spreading disc. This prevents granules from breaking apart and becoming powdery. The agitator mounted below in the hopper provides for a constant stream of fertiliser dust, seeds or granules to the dosing opening(s). Moreover, the agitator prevents the chunks of fertiliser from blocking</text><text>one or more dosing openings.</text><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>23</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="24"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>Adjust carefully</text><text>Application rate</text><image /><text>Fine dosing</text><text>Fine application handle Normal dosing setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Normal dosing setting" /><text>Fine application handle Fine application setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Fine application setting" /><text>24</text><text>The spreader has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently of each other. Moreover, it is possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings so that the application rate can also be set precisely with a low flowrate, while the risk of blockages remains limited.</text><text>The machine is equipped with two actuators, which service a dosing plate each, in order to set the application rate. This actuator can open the dosing plate in every required position. In this way, accurate dosing independent of the driving speed is possible. It is also possible to control the dosing setting with external sensors, for example, a nitrogen sensor.</text><text> See paragraph »Application rate« on page 66.</text><text>The actuators are controlled by means of the spreader software. By means of weight sensors, the spreader continuously measures the discharge volumes and corrects it as needed with the application rate. If you want to close on one side, you can choose the function on the control box, after which one of the two dosing plates will be closed immediately.</text><text>Normal dosing</text><text>For precise dosing over a wide range of settings, a spreader with 3 openings is applied per disc.</text><text>Fine application</text><text>The spreader is equipped with a fine spreader as standard equipment to spread low application rates.
