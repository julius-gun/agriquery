This will also provide information about additional types of fertiliser that have been tested recently. You can make use of the online spreading chart service as an alternative to the spreading chart book. You must enter the characteristics of the fertiliser, your working width, application rate, driving speed and the type of fertiliser.

After choosing the desired fertiliser type, the working width, application rate, driving speed, dosing and discharge opening are transmitted to the spreader using the AutosetApp. The spreader then automatically gets the correct setting. Automatic adjustment of the discharge point only applies to GEOSPREAD spreaders. The same data may be transmitted to the spreader via the AutosetApp for the other weighing spreader models such as Exacta-CL EW and Exacta-TL(X).

Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with the materials could lead to personal injury.</text><text>Be careful that nothing gets jammed</text><text>It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully while making adjustments:</text><text>· switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition,</text><text>· engage the parking brake of the tractor,</text><text>· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with filling, adjusting or testing,</text><text>· Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured spreader,</text><text>· Comply carefully with the instructions.</text><text>Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.</text><text>Protecting the environment</text><text>Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.</text><text>Work with a closed cabin</text><text>Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.</text><text>Set the spreader based on the details obtained from the correct spreading chart, the desired application rate (kg/ha) and the driving speed (km/h).</text><text>You can find the methods for determining the correct spreading chart in</text><text> the instruction manual of the software.</text><text>The spreading chart page contains information about the fertiliser to which this chart relates.

The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.</text><text>The discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point, of the spreading chart.</text><text>Always check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).</text><text> see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.</text><text>In the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.</text><text>You can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.</text><text>TIP Set the spreader angle before you fill the hopper. It is easier to adjust the top link if the hopper is empty.</text><text>Check the position again after the hopper has been filled!</text><text>If the inclination is at 4 o of 8 o, the spreader area slides further behind the spreader.</text><text> In the machine data screen, increase the length B by 10% or 20% at 4 o or 8 o.</text><text> Please refer to the software instruction manual for the procedure.</text><text>The (online) spreading chart shows the rpm of the spreading discs as well as the rpm of the PTO shaft. The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.</text><text>The PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones. Use the connection point shown in the spreading chart.</text><text>See paragraph »Border spreading« on page 106.</text><text>65</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="66"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Application rate</text><text>Constant application rate</text><image /><image /><image /><text>The control system can drive the spreader in three different ways:</text><text>· distribution that resembles the settings for the preset application rate must be determined under changing circumstances through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,</text><text> see the paragraph below,»Constant application rate«.</text><text>with similar or lower application rates (&lt; 40 kg/min) the fine application kit should be used,</text><text> See paragraph »Fine application« on page 67.</text><text>· with very low application rates on very uneven terrain, preset application rates must be checked manually to ensure that the correct dosing setting is being distributed, without automatic calibration but with driving speed correction,</text><text>· under changing circumstances location specific application rate driven by an external signal, through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,</text><text> See paragraph »Variable, externally driven application rate« on page 72.</text><text>The control system can spread an equal amount of fertiliser over the entire field. In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.</text><text>The control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.</text><text> See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.</text><text>Look for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:</text><text> Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.</text><text> The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.</text><text> The given values are to be entered in the control system.</text><text>If the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate.

With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period.
