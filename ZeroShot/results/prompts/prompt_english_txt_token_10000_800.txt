To be done before spreading
INDICATION
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
You can fill the spreader to the desired levels after it has been put in place. It is recommended that the machine be loaded while it is lifted 10 cm above the soil. If no activities need to be performed on top of the hopper, the height can be adjusted with the automatic filling system.
A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in
 paragraph »Technical specifications« on page 36.
 If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.
 Lower the machine at the desired level. The machine must not rest on the ground, but rather be lifted a minimum distance of 10 cm!
 Check if the dosing units are closed. Close them if necessary by pressing the stop key on the main screen.
The position of the dosing units is displayed in the main screen on the control box of the control system.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Place wheel chocks in front of the wheels of the tractor.
 If a mobile loading platform is being used, place the loading platform at the spreader so that there would be a maximum distance of 200 mm between the two.
 Open the hopper cover.
 Check if the sieve is closed and secured.
 Fill the machine to the desired level with the correct tools. Fill the hopper halves to the same level so that the both of them would run empty at the same time.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Work carefully while filling and take the regulations that apply to working conditions into consideration! Make sure no objects or tools fall into the hopper. as it could block or damage the spreader!
 Close the hopper cover.
Do not exceed the maximum recommended weight!  See also »Technical specifications« on page 36. The machine has not been constructed to carry the additional weight. Keep the axle load, load capacity of the wheels and the total weight of the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted
machines« on page 13.
INDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.
INDICATION
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

Spreading pattern check (tray test)
76
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!
Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.
Tray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.
We recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
When to perform the tray test:
· When using a fertiliser type that is not in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using a fertiliser type of which the distribution and density deviate from the values indicated in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using fertiliser of moderate quality.
· Test should be carried out annually on the left and the right side to check the equal distribution of both spreading discs.
· After each change to the spreading mechanism of the spreader or when parts are replaced.
Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test. The tray test should be performed with dry weather, low humidity and with a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2).
Material required
· measuring tape or ruler,
· spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
· 7 troughs,
· 7 graduated tubes,
· 1 funnel,
· notebook, pen and calculator,
· this manual.
· the instruction manual of the software.
General instructions
 Check the preset dosing setting and the discharge point.
 Check the height (75 cm above the troughs) and the position (angle) of the spreader.
 Check the rpm of the PTO shaft and the spreader discs.
 Always place the buckets horizontally on the floor.
 Place the buckets at a maximum distance of 4 metres. Provide additional widths for testing widths of more than 24 meters. Also, you can first test part of the working width and then empty the trays and distribute them over the rest of the working width.
 Do not use the spreader while it is raining or with high humidity. This will cause the fertiliser to cling to the troughs, which would not provide the desired results.
 Do not spread with wind speeds of more than 3 m/s (wind force of 2).

To be done before spreading
If the spreader is correctly set and the tramlines are set at the correct distance from each other you would achieve a good distribution of fertiliser over the land. This will only be achieved if the spreader spreads with the correct spreading pattern.
This is then the reason why you have to test the spreading pattern and adjust it as required.
 See also paragraph »Full field spreading pattern« on page 28.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width (X metre) that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
 Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.
The actual width is twice the size of the effective working width!
If you want to spread over a working width of 24 metres, place the buckets at 24/6 metres = 4 metres.

Operation
 Do not change the position of the border spreading plate and disconnect the right or left spreading disc.
With the first time:
 Do not change the settings of the spreader, the PTO shaft rpm or the driving speed as these should be the same as settings for border spreading.

· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check whether the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (<40km/h) on your tractor, is hidden by the implement.

Only start working once all machine parts have stopped and the control lever have been secured. Wear safety shoes and gloves and work alone. If something gets jammed it could lead to personal injury.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.<|begin_of_text|>

INDICATION
Use in the field
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist weather conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Before you can make the first pass, you must make adjustments in the field to:
The following is important to ensure that the spreader works properly:
· set it to the correct height from the ground or above the crop and
· by levelling it with the lift rod adjustment and top link.
Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.
 Use the power lift to lift the machine to the correct height.
 Set the spreader horizontally with the lift rod adjustment and the top link.
 Lock the lift limiter in this position.
Height correction with top dressing
If the required height of 75 cm above the crop is not possible with your power lift
 use the high spreading setting of the linkage pins and/or
 set the spreader forward as indicated in the spreading charts.
 See paragraph »Selecting linkage pin height« on page 53.

Last setting check
96
A checklist is given below, as well as in the jacket of the spreading chart.
 Do this last check to ensure good spreading results.
Are you working with the correct settings from the correct spreading chart, based on:
· distribution,
· similar weight,
· type of fertiliser,
· desired working width,
· desired driving speed?
Did you set the spreader in the correct way? Did you:
· set the height over the ground or crops to 75 cm?
· was the correct vane combination mounted?
· are the correct number of dosing openings opened (fine application)?
· is the correct discharge point set?
· is the correct application rate set?
· is the correct GEOPOINT® (centre spreading pattern) set?
· is the coupling shaft fitted to the correct point on the gearbox?
· is the ExactLine or hydraulic border spreading plate in the transport setting (or working position)?
· are the data required entered in the control system?
Did you check the following settings:
Did you:
· have you checked the control system settings?
· perform a tray test to check the spreading pattern?
Work in the correct manner:
· Is the field data selected or input correctly?
· Is the GEOCONTROL application setting correct?
· Have you correctly set the offset?
 See the software instruction manual.
· Did you set the correct PTO shaft rpm?
· Are you driving at the correct driving speed?
· Did you set the tramlines at the correct distance?
· Wind speed too high?<|begin_of_text|>

Working with the GEOCONTROL
Starting a new task is done from a saved field or one to be created newly with the GEOCONTROL application.
 Refer to the GEOCONTROL manual in your terminal for this purpose.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass. The headland will act as the field boundary and is saved in GEOCONTROL.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass.
 Spread a broad or double headland so that you make the connection while driving straight before making a turn.
Thereafter, the field can be filled in full passes. You can create a (spray)track pattern for following processes.
Prevent drive errors
It is important that the spreading patterns overlap well to ensure good distribution. A difference in the overlapping is less vital with average working widths, using a triangular spreading pattern.
Differences in the spreading pattern would easily be noticed with a trapezium shape on very large working widths, in particular. The overlap of the spreading pattern is then much smaller and therefore more sensitive to mistakes.
This can be prevented by setting tramlines before hand. This can be done by setting out tramlines on the headlands and marking them with, for example, picket poles.
Visibility of the from headland to headland is very important. Place additional markers in the field if necessary to ensure that the track is clearly visible.
When controlled by the GEOCONTROL the spreader has the option of reducing the working width in order to connect the incomplete final pass with the next one.

Tramline patterns
Using the ExactLine with tramlines

Your preferred border spreading method determines the tramline pattern.
Select on the basis of the site width, the presence of the spreader tramlines and the spreader's equipment.
Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) when doing boundary track spreading with ExactLine (optional extra).
 Set the first way at half the working width (1/2 X meter) from the field edge (in the first sprayer tramline).
 The paths that follow are set at the full working width.

Using the hydraulic border spreading plate with tramlines
During one-sided boundary spreading with hydraulic border spreading plate, you drive along the outermost work area on the field edge and control the fertiliser granule stream by means of the hydraulic border spreading plate (accessory).
The paths that follow are set at:
· half the working width of Situation A (the first sprayer tramline),
· the complete working width Situation B.

To begin spreading, proceed as follows:
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Drive the tractor to the first tramline, depending on the driving pattern required, which may be recognised by the marker in place.
 Switch the control box on.
 Check the settings as described in
 Without GEOCONTROL, select and activate a site number in the field registration,
 Switch on the PTO shaft and set the correct spreading disc rpm as reported in the spreading chart.
Do not allow the spreading disc to run for longer than is necessary while the dosing units are closed. This will prevent the agitator from grinding the fertiliser.
 Start driving and open the dosing units at the same time by pressing the start key.
The rpm of the tractor engine (therefore also of the PTO shaft) must remain constant while spreading (with regards to distributing fertiliser along the width).
The driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed!
Based on the offset set in the 'TC Implement Settings' screen, the GEOCONTROL will switch the spreading sections off by itself when passing the headland limit. This happens if the spreading pattern overlaps completely and you run up the headland.
Depending on the set overlap percentage, the connection on the headland and gores will more or less overlap.
The usual setting is 50%.
 See the GEOCONTROL manual.
Even the extent of overlap of the field boundary created can be separately set in the GEOCONTROL manual.
TIP Set the overlap on the field boundary to 0 if you do not wish to spread over the field boundary.<|begin_of_text|>

approaching headland with the GEOCONTROL function switched off:
 Close the dosing units by pressing the stop key before turning to the headland. The PTO shaft can keep running if you intend to start spreading immediately again.
You will find the correct working method and corresponding distances on the headland in
 the next paragraph »Working method on the headland« and paragraph »Spreading on field« from page 97.
 Drive to the next tramline and re-start the spreader at the right time, as displayed in the next paragraph »Working method on the headland«.
In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:
 Stop spreading immediately!
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 See then paragraph »Failure and stoppage« on page 113.
If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.
At low doses <50 kg/ha, it is possible to reduce the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration to minus 15 kg.
 See the software instruction manual.
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

The driving pattern that you use, in other words how you must turn on the headland, depends on your border spreading method.
· spreading the border from the sprayer tramline with ExactLine, one-sided boundary spreading with additional room with the border spreading plate (situation A), or
· border spreading by closing off one disc and using a border spreading plate (situation B).
Do the following when spreading the headland:
