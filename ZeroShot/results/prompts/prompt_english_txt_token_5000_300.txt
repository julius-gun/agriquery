Setting the spreader
68
The dosing setting to be set can be:
· Read from the relevant spreading chart when you want to spread at a lower application rate using the fine application kit and the symbol of the Fine application kit is indicated in the spreading chart. This is indicated by means of 1 open hole (dosing opening).
· Determine an application rate not given as described in paragraph »Discharge point«from page 65.
· To be calculated using the relevant spreading chart when you wish to spread at a lower application rate with the fine application kit, and the Fine application kit symbol is indicated in the spreading chart; it is indicated using 3 open holes (dosage opening).
Calculation
As 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed the flowrate of the remaining dosing opening should be three times as much in order to obtain an even application rate.
 Read the Dosing Setting, Discharge Point and Flowrate from the spreading chart. Calculate the flowrate with the formula given below as required.
If the selected application rate or driving speed is not indicated in the spreading chart the required flowrate can also be calculated as follows:
flowrate required (kg/min) =
Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)
600
Use the letter given for setting the discharge point in the line of the spreading chart that most closely resembling the calculated flowrate.
 Multiply the flowrate (given in the Kg/min column or calculated) with a factor of 3.
 Select the closest flowrate for the whole spreader in the Kg/min column.
 Read off the relevant dosing setting or estimate it as closely as possible.

Suppose you would want to spread Nutramon from the example with the features as given in the spreading chart on this page: With a working width of 27 metres, a driving speed of 8 km/h and a se-
lected application rate of 25 kg/ha.
The required application rate falls beyond the scope of the spreading chart.
 Calculate the required flowrate.
27 (m) x 8 (km/h) x 25 (kg/ha)
600 flowrate required (kg/min) =
Result: flowrate required = 9 kg/min.
 Set the discharge point as indicated in the chart: J.
 Calculate the required flowrate with fine application: 3 x 9 = 27 kg/ min.
 This value is in the dosing setting: 18+3 (= 21).
 Do a manual calibration test to check the flowrate setting.

PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
You can check with a manual calibration test if the preset dosing setting reaches the selected flowrate.
The calibration test is normally performed on the left spreading disc. Perform the calibration test with a filled hopper.  See also paragraph »Filling« on page 73.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Remove the vanes from the left spreading disc.
 Connect the coupling shaft to the coupling point on the machine shown in the relevant spreading chart.

RS 232 connection
72
The control system provides the options to distribute the same application rate all over the field and the option to spread a variable, externally driven application rate. This provides the option to spread as per requirements, e.g. through a nitrogen sensor.
An application rate that had been preset in the corresponding management system for the relevant field can also be entered through the GPS system.
 For the options and corresponding settings, see the user's manuals for the external system and the control box, e.g. the IsoMatch. The control system of the spreader in combination with the IsoMatch control box also transmits the application rate and working width used back to the external system.
The external system and the control system of a spreader with an IsoMatch control box communicate through a serial port with an RS 232 connection. This connection is located at the back of the control box. The occupation of pins in the 9-point RS 232 plug and the settings required are given in

Filling
[Image]
To be done before spreading
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You could come into contact with materials when filling the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Chemical reactions caused by mixing fertilisers
Mixing different types of fertiliser could lead to a chemical reaction whereby poisonous vapours, liquids or other materials could come about. Possible danger of explosion! This could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.
Only mix different types of fertiliser if allowed by the manufacturer(s).
Chemical reactions could lead to damage to the machines and personal injury.
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and apply that. Protective clothing should be worn when necessary.
Disregarding the safety instructions could result in personal injury and damage to the machine.
Use proper tools
Great volumes of material is often handled during the filling process. Use proper tools such as lifting devices when moving and filling the machine. Keep legislation concerning working conditions in mind. Work carefully and responsibly. Inferior tools can cause serious inju-
ries.
Only fill mounted machines
Never place a machine in the ground while filling it. Always keep it in the power lift of the tractor. The machine is designed to be loaded while in a suspended state. Never park a filled machine on the ground. Filling the machine while it is on the ground could lead to damage.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
73<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 74===

To be done before spreading
INDICATION
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
You can fill the spreader to the desired levels after it has been put in place. It is recommended that the machine be loaded while it is lifted 10 cm above the soil. If no activities need to be performed on top of the hopper, the height can be adjusted with the automatic filling system.
A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in
 paragraph »Technical specifications« on page 36.
 If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.
 Lower the machine at the desired level. The machine must not rest on the ground, but rather be lifted a minimum distance of 10 cm!
 Check if the dosing units are closed. Close them if necessary by pressing the stop key on the main screen.
The position of the dosing units is displayed in the main screen on the control box of the control system.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Place wheel chocks in front of the wheels of the tractor.
 If a mobile loading platform is being used, place the loading platform at the spreader so that there would be a maximum distance of 200 mm between the two.
 Open the hopper cover.
 Check if the sieve is closed and secured.
 Fill the machine to the desired level with the correct tools. Fill the hopper halves to the same level so that the both of them would run empty at the same time.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Work carefully while filling and take the regulations that apply to working conditions into consideration! Make sure no objects or tools fall into the hopper. as it could block or damage the spreader!
 Close the hopper cover.
Do not exceed the maximum recommended weight!  See also »Technical specifications« on page 36. The machine has not been constructed to carry the additional weight. Keep the axle load, load capacity of the wheels and the total weight of the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted
machines« on page 13.
INDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.
INDICATION
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

Spreading pattern check (tray test)
76
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!
Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.
