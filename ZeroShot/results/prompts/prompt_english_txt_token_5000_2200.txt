To be done before spreading
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
You can check with a manual calibration test if the preset dosing setting reaches the selected flowrate.
The calibration test is normally performed on the left spreading disc. Perform the calibration test with a filled hopper.  See also paragraph »Filling« on page 73.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Remove the vanes from the left spreading disc.
 Connect the coupling shaft to the coupling point on the machine shown in the relevant spreading chart.
 See also paragraph »Coupling shaft connection point« on page 64.
 Mount the calibration container carefully on the left spreading disc.
 Set the calibration container with the settings knob so that the spreading disc does not touch the calibration container.
 Weigh a large trough and place it under the discharging point of the calibration container.
 Start the tractor again.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Switch the control box on.
 Switch the right spreading disc off.
 See the software instruction manual.
 Engage the PTO shaft.
 Open the left dosing unit.
 Allow the spreader to spread for 5 seconds in order to 'rinse' the calibration container.
 Close the dosing unit.
 Switch the PTO shaft and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition, empty the trough and place it back under the discharge point of the calibration container.<|begin_of_text|>

RS 232 connection
72
The control system provides the options to distribute the same application rate all over the field and the option to spread a variable, externally driven application rate. This provides the option to spread as per requirements, e.g. through a nitrogen sensor.
An application rate that had been preset in the corresponding management system for the relevant field can also be entered through the GPS system.
 For the options and corresponding settings, see the user's manuals for the external system and the control box, e.g. the IsoMatch. The control system of the spreader in combination with the IsoMatch control box also transmits the application rate and working width used back to the external system.
The external system and the control system of a spreader with an IsoMatch control box communicate through a serial port with an RS 232 connection. This connection is located at the back of the control box. The occupation of pins in the 9-point RS 232 plug and the settings required are given in

Filling
[Image]
To be done before spreading
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You could come into contact with materials when filling the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Chemical reactions caused by mixing fertilisers
Mixing different types of fertiliser could lead to a chemical reaction whereby poisonous vapours, liquids or other materials could come about. Possible danger of explosion! This could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.
Only mix different types of fertiliser if allowed by the manufacturer(s).
Chemical reactions could lead to damage to the machines and personal injury.
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and apply that. Protective clothing should be worn when necessary.
Disregarding the safety instructions could result in personal injury and damage to the machine.
Use proper tools
Great volumes of material is often handled during the filling process. Use proper tools such as lifting devices when moving and filling the machine. Keep legislation concerning working conditions in mind. Work carefully and responsibly. Inferior tools can cause serious inju-
ries.
Only fill mounted machines
Never place a machine in the ground while filling it. Always keep it in the power lift of the tractor. The machine is designed to be loaded while in a suspended state. Never park a filled machine on the ground. Filling the machine while it is on the ground could lead to damage.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
73<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 74===

To be done before spreading
INDICATION
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
You can fill the spreader to the desired levels after it has been put in place. It is recommended that the machine be loaded while it is lifted 10 cm above the soil. If no activities need to be performed on top of the hopper, the height can be adjusted with the automatic filling system.
A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in
 paragraph »Technical specifications« on page 36.
 If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.
 Lower the machine at the desired level. The machine must not rest on the ground, but rather be lifted a minimum distance of 10 cm!
 Check if the dosing units are closed. Close them if necessary by pressing the stop key on the main screen.
The position of the dosing units is displayed in the main screen on the control box of the control system.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Place wheel chocks in front of the wheels of the tractor.
 If a mobile loading platform is being used, place the loading platform at the spreader so that there would be a maximum distance of 200 mm between the two.
 Open the hopper cover.
 Check if the sieve is closed and secured.
 Fill the machine to the desired level with the correct tools. Fill the hopper halves to the same level so that the both of them would run empty at the same time.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Work carefully while filling and take the regulations that apply to working conditions into consideration! Make sure no objects or tools fall into the hopper. as it could block or damage the spreader!
 Close the hopper cover.
Do not exceed the maximum recommended weight!  See also »Technical specifications« on page 36. The machine has not been constructed to carry the additional weight. Keep the axle load, load capacity of the wheels and the total weight of the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted
machines« on page 13.
INDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.
INDICATION
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

Spreading pattern check (tray test)
76
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!
Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.
Tray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.
We recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
When to perform the tray test:
· When using a fertiliser type that is not in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using a fertiliser type of which the distribution and density deviate from the values indicated in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using fertiliser of moderate quality.
· Test should be carried out annually on the left and the right side to check the equal distribution of both spreading discs.
· After each change to the spreading mechanism of the spreader or when parts are replaced.
Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test. The tray test should be performed with dry weather, low humidity and with a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2).
Material required
· measuring tape or ruler,
· spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
· 7 troughs,
· 7 graduated tubes,
· 1 funnel,
· notebook, pen and calculator,
· this manual.
· the instruction manual of the software.
General instructions
 Check the preset dosing setting and the discharge point.
 Check the height (75 cm above the troughs) and the position (angle) of the spreader.
 Check the rpm of the PTO shaft and the spreader discs.
 Always place the buckets horizontally on the floor.
 Place the buckets at a maximum distance of 4 metres. Provide additional widths for testing widths of more than 24 meters. Also, you can first test part of the working width and then empty the trays and distribute them over the rest of the working width.
 Do not use the spreader while it is raining or with high humidity. This will cause the fertiliser to cling to the troughs, which would not provide the desired results.
 Do not spread with wind speeds of more than 3 m/s (wind force of 2).

Test the left and right spreading patterns
INDICATION
[Image]
The left and right spreading discs must spread the same volumes of fertiliser to ensure good distribution. Check this every year!
This test describes a working width of 24 metres. You are of course free to run the test for a different working width. Divide the buckets at equal distances along the working width.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the left spreading disc by sliding the connector to he left. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Search the correct discharge position to spread over 24 metres in the best comparable fertiliser, seeds or granules (online) spreading chart and set the handle accordingly.
 See paragraph »Discharge point« on page 65 and the foreword of the spreading chart book.
 Fit the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point of the central gearbox as indicated in the associated spreading chart.
 See paragraph »Coupling shaft connection point« on page 64.
 Check the height of the spreader (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
 Place the other troughs 4 metres to the right of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
78<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 79===

[Image]
To be done before spreading
 Start the tractor again.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Switch the control box on.
 Enter the required application rate.
 Enter the working width.
It is recommended that an application rate of at least 250 kg/ha is entered with the selected driving speed.
 Switch on the left spreading disc.
 Switch off the automatic calibration.
 Engage the PTO shaft and set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 Open the right dosing unit.
 Drive over the first trough and stop only after you have driven at least 20 metres past this trough. This is because the spreader distributes roughly even to the back, front and to the side.
 Close the dosing unit.
 Empty the trough with a funnel into the graduated tubes and record the reading in your notebook.
Repeat the above procedure, but disconnect the right spreading disc and switch the dosing unit of the right spreading disc off. Put the troughs on the left side of the tractor track.
Drive with the same speed and with the same PTO shaft rpm as with the first time!
79<|begin_of_text|>

To be done before spreading
Assessment
 Record the values you find in the graduated tubes for the left and right spreading discs.
 Compare the values, calculate the percentage differences between the measuring tubes on the left and the right.
Adaptation
If the spreading patterns on the left and right spreading discs are not the same and the difference is greater than 3% you will have to do the following, or request your dealer to do so:
 Check if the machine is hanging horizontally and vertically behind the tractor in length and width.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the dosing mechanism« as described on page 133 and repeat the test.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism« as described on page 136 and repeat the test.
If the difference in the spreading pattern is too great, contact your dealer.

Full field spreading pattern test
[Image]
To be done before spreading
If the spreader is correctly set and the tramlines are set at the correct distance from each other you would achieve a good distribution of fertiliser over the land. This will only be achieved if the spreader spreads with the correct spreading pattern.
This is then the reason why you have to test the spreading pattern and adjust it as required.
 See also paragraph »Full field spreading pattern« on page 28.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width (X metre) that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
 Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.
The actual width is twice the size of the effective working width!
If you want to spread over a working width of 24 metres, place the buckets at 24/6 metres = 4 metres.
