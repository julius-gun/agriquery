Other connections are made via the "Input IM Tellus" cable, supplied as a standard item.
Connect the ISOBUS tractor via IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable
If your tractor is provided with a complete ISOBUS connection, a connection with the 9-pins in Cab cable between your tractor and the IsoMatch control box is sufficient.
Other connections are made via the "Input IM Tellus" cable, supplied as a standard item.
Input IM Tellus with ISO11786 In cab connection
A connection set is supplied as a standard item with the IsoMatch for:
· ISO 11786 In cab
· lights and ignition
· Tractor CAN (optional plug specific to the tractor required)
· Video input.
IsoMatch power cable set for non-ISO tractors
If the tractor does not have an ISOBUS communication, it can be added with the IsoMatch power cable set.
Hereafter, your tractor is entirely ISOBUS ready, and you can connect and operate the machine with the IsoMatch control box.
The "Input IM Tellus" cable, supplied as a standard item, can be used for other connections.

Directly to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection in the tractor cabin
You can mount an optional extension cable to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection on the 7-point plug "Input IM Tellus" cable supplied as a standard item.
Directly to the tractor radar or wheel sensor
You can connect the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch control box with the optional "Sensor input IM Tellus".
This is needed if your tractor does not have the ISO 11786 in cab connection. Other connections are the same as the "Input IM Tellus" cable set, supplied as a standard item.
Various cables and extension cables for many different types of radar are available.

An extended ISO cable is available for a tractor-trailed spreader. This replaces the short cable that is already fitted. Exchange the whole cable.
 The wire-connecting diagram is displayed in the spare parts manual.
The Tellus control box communicates with an external system via an RS 232 connection. You can use a cable with an RS232 plug to connect the signal from an external system to the Tellus control box. You can find the plug pin occupation in

A user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop which, after the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with
· Task controller
· external application rate
· control for headland management and GEOSPREAD functions.

IsoMatch GEOCONTROL is an advanced software application for more precise and efficient use of fertiliser spreaders.
Site-dependent control of your GEOSPREADER
Around the spreader
· to get spreading done specific to the site
· with automatic headland control
· and working width reduction with gored spreading,
you require additional software. See the website www.isomatchshop.com
The IsoMatch Grip is a control unit on which most of the machine functions used can be operated centrally with one handle. This is available in addition to the ISO tractor or ISOMatch control box.
Handle control
While working attention and visibility is often required to follow the work process. If operating buttons can be located by the sense of touch  reaction  speed  can  be  increased  and  operating  mistakes avoided. By locating the control buttons on the handle by touch while you are looking where you are driving system control can remain focussed.
