Stop the engine and remove the keys from the ignition
Switch the engine off as soon as you leave the tractor. Remove the key from the ignition to prevent the tractor from being started unintentionally while you are in the danger zone. This especially applies when changing the settings or while maintenance and repairs are carried out.
Keep clear from a running machine
Fertiliser is spread over a great distance during operation. Ensure that nobody comes within working reach of the machine during operation. Do not come into the working area before all parts of the machine are standing still.
The power lift must only be operated outside of the danger zone
In the area between the tractor and the machine, there is a danger of being pinned down by the power lift. The power lift must therefore only be engaged from beyond the danger zone. Secure the tractor with the parking brake and wheel chocks to ensure it would not roll away.
Do not approach the machine until it has come to a complete standstill
The rotating parts of the machine never come to an immediate halt, they always wind down. The moving parts of a machine are not always visible. Do not approach the machine until all moving parts have come to a complete halt.
Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured machine
The machine or parts of the machine could accidentally fall due to waning pressure, for instance. Always place the machine on proper supports if you have to work under the machine!<|begin_of_text|>

Only lift the machine at the lifting points
If a machine is being elevated, only attach it to the indicated lifting points. Never go underneath an elevated machine. Allow for any possible movements of the elevated machine, whether wanted or not.
Be careful of getting jammed or pinched
If the machine is engaged or operated unintentionally you could get struck in moving parts, which could lead to injury. Be extra alert when working in the vicinity of moving parts. Always keep in mind that the motor or parts of the machine could still be retaining some energy.
Read the user's manual
The instruction manual contains procedures for working correctly to ensure safe work, as well as dangers one could possibly encounter. Keep to these procedures as described and give due consideration to the safety measures in place!
Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars
Prevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working with higher pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.
Motor vehicles with limited speed (<40 km/h), agricultural and forestry tractors and their trailers, as well as other vehicles, must be provided with an orange triangle with a red reflector at the rear in the form of a truncated triangle.

To be used and operated by 1 person
The machine may only be operated by one person, from the tractor. Operating the machine from the tractor will keep you out of harm's way. Other people should not be in the immediate vicinity of the machine and the tractor. Those who are within the working area and the danger zone could be injured.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
Check the state of the tractor and machine
Only work with the tractor and machine if they are in good condition Always check that:
· all lighting, safety and warning provisions must be mounted correctly and be in good working condition,
· the lifting and pulling capabilities must be sufficient,
 see paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines« on page 13,
· the tractor must be suitable for the machine, such as in the area of stability, engine capability, axle load and total weight,
· it is sufficient for the working with the machine and for transport.
Adhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or machine damage.

Put a fire extinguisher in place
Carry a fire extinguisher at all times, especially when operating in dry crop materials. This should be a multi-purpose ABC rated extinguisher with a 5 kg capacity, approved by the appropriate authority. Mount this on the tractor and/or on the machine. Fire could damage the machine and cause injury.
Use active carbon filters
Harmful gasses and mists could enter the air duct of the tractor while it is in use. An active carbon filter should therefore be mounted in the air ventilation of the tractor. Harmful materials could cause serious personal injury.
Ensure the tractor is safe when leaving it
Never leave the tractor without:
· switching off the PTO shaft,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the tractor engine,
· the key must be removed from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
Leaving the tractor unsafe could create dangerous situations that could lead to injury.
Responding to problems
In the event of operational problems you should:
· stop immediately,
· switch the tractor and machine off,
· attend to the problem or call in the assistance of an expert.
Never use the tractor in a closed area
The tractor must never be used in a closed area. Exhaust fumes collect without being noticed. Exhaust fumes can cause serious or deadly injuries.
The following is of importance with the loading machine to ensure safe operation:
· the maximum load of the machine,
· the maximum axle load of the tractor,
· weight distribution over the axles,
· and the carry load per wheel.
At least 20% own weight from the tractor must rest on the front axle and 45% on the rear axle in order to maintain good manoeuvrability. Check if these conditions are adhered to before purchasing a machine! Adhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or tractor and machine damage.

The calculations can be made with the values given in the above chart.
Actual total weight
The actual total weight must not exceed the permitted total weight. The actual total weight (in kg) is calculated as follows:
Actual total weight (kg) = A + D + E
Actual front axle load
The actual front axle load must not exceed the permitted maximum load. The actual total front axle load (in kg) is calculated as follows:
g Actual front axle load = D x ( f + g ) + ( B x g ) - E x (h + i )
Actual rear axle load
The actual rear axle load must not exceed the permitted maximum load. The actual total rear axle load (in kg) is calculated as follows:
Actual rear axle load (kg) =
actual total weight (kg) -
actual front axle load (kg)
Ballast required in the front
The minimum load on the front axle must be 20% of the basic weight of the tractor. With a mounted machine in the power lift behind the tractor the minimum required ballast (in kg) in front of the tractor is calculated as follows:
f + g Front ballast required (kg) = E x ( h + i ) - ( B x g ) + (0.2 x A x g )
If the calculated value is negative no additional ballast is required.

Ballast required in the rear
The minimum load on the rear axle must be 45% of the basic weight of the tractor. With a machine mounted in the front power lift the minimum required ballast (in kg) in the power lift behind the tractor is calculated as follows:
( D x f ) - ( C x g ) + (0.45 x A x g )

Safety decals
Check the condition of the machine before use
Check the following before using the machine:
· is the machine in a proper, functioning condition?
· are all lights, safety and warning provisions correctly mounted and in good working condition?
· are the brakes of the machine working properly and have they been adjusted to the correct position?
Using an unsafe machine could result in personal injury and damage to the machine.
The machine should only carry, not pull!
It is not permitted to use the machine for pulling as this would have detrimental consequences to its construction. This could lead to dangerous situations for bystanders, unsafe operation or damage to crops.
Do not stand on the machine
Being on the machine during activities and transport is prohibited. You may only be on the parts of the machine intended for the purpose if it is standing still and prevented from rolling by means of parking brake and wheel chocks. Being on the machine while in any other state could lead to serious injury.
Never work on a running machine
Never work on the machine while it is running. A running machine has several moving parts which can not be seen. Wait until all parts have come to a complete halt. Moving parts can cause serious injuries.
Follow the instructions on the stickers
The safety decals on the machine give important advice for a risk free operation. Respect them to ensure your safety.
Replace any safety decals and safety signs missing or illegible
When parts with a safety or warning decal are replaced, the replacement part must be provided with the same safety or warning decal. Stickers that are not legible must be replaced so that they would be clearly legible at all times.

Use the correct coupling shaft
Only use coupling shafts complying with the manufacturer's specification for that specific use! In order to ensure protection of both man and machine exercise extreme caution when working at a coupling shaft other then described in this manual and/or on the instruction at the coupling shaft.
Modifications to and other special activities at coupling shafts are only permitted with the explicit written instruction and approval of the manufacturers of both the machine and the coupling shaft! Use the correct tools and original parts to ensure a good performance and maximum safety. The use of an incorrect coupling shaft can cause damage to the machine.
Mount the appropriate protection
Externally accessible coupling shafts, the tractor's PTO shafts and machine input-axle must be equipped with appropriate guards and tubes. Working without guarding can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Replace protective coupling shaft tubes when required
Replace the coupling shaft protection sleeves at the first signs of wear. Protection sleeves can wear without being noticed. Worn or damaged protection sleeves can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protect the PTO shaft end well
Slide the protection sleeve over the PTO shaft as soon as the coupling shaft has been removed. Clothing could become entangled into an unprotected PTO shaft end that could lead to serious injury.
Hydraulic oil is under high pressure
Never try to stop a leak with your fingers. Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!
Disconnect the control box
Disconnect the control box from the electric system as soon as no more functions are needed in order to prevent unintentional operation. Keeping the control box connect can be dangerous and can damage the machine
as well as cause bodily injury.
Battery cables must be connected properly
Always disconnect the battery cable (negative pole) from the electric system when working on the machine. Connect the battery cables correctly: Positive pole first, followed by the negative pole. Always equip the positive pole with the appropriate protective cap to avoid a short circuit as this could lead to damage to the tractor and machine.<|begin_of_text|>

The decoupling ropes must never be tense and must provide sufficient freedom for movement, even with the power lift in the lowest position as it could otherwise accidentally disconnect the quick coupling.
Drive carefully
Moving behaviour, manoeuvrability and braking performance are influenced by a trailed machine. When taking turns, pay attention to the extended width/length (turning circle) and/or large mass (sluggishness) of the machine. Ensure sufficient braking effect and safe manageability! Careless driving could lead to serious injury and damage to the machine.
Adjust the driving speed
High driving speeds and uneven surfaces on the road or field can put considerable strain on the machine and cause the tractor or machine to be overstrained, which could lead to damage. Always adjust the driving speed to the conditions of the environment and the terrain! When driving up and down hills and across slopes, do not make any sudden turns!
Do not leave the driving cabin
Never leave the operator's seat during operation or transport. The driver can be in the danger zone of the tractor or the machine and could not have a proper view of the immediate vicinity. This could lead to injury to the driver or third parties.
Do not allow the machine to tilt
When driving up and down hills and across slopes, do not make any sudden turns! Do not drive transverse on a slope with a steep angle. Tilting can cause serious machine damage.
Blockade of a security device
In case of blockade or operation of a security device, never work on the machine without:
· switching off the PTO shaft,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the tractor engine,
· the key must be removed from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.<|begin_of_text|>

Always keep to the prescribed maintenance intervals
Take the machine for inspection and maintenance at the intervals as prescribed in this manual. All of the manufacturer's responsibility and the guarantee will become null and void if the prescribed intervals are not adhered to.
Performed by an authorised person
Always have an authorised expert perform maintenance and repairs as prescribed in, as prescribed in
 paragraph »Authorisation« on page 11.
Maintenance performed in an inexpert manner could lead to unsafe work situations or damage to the machine or crops.
Never use the tractor in a closed area
The tractor must never be used in a closed area. Exhaust fumes collect without being noticed. Exhaust fumes can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protect the machine
Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan.
Only use original parts when replacing
Using other non-genuine parts could lead to problems and unsafe situations when using the machine.
You can use the supplied parts manual (either as a printout or as a PDF in the included memory card) to locate the correct part number.
Never work on the machine while it is running
Never work on the machine while it is running. A running machine has several moving parts which can not be seen. These can cause serious injuries.
Do not change the machine
Do not modify the machine in any way. Unauthorised modifications may impair the function and/or safety and affect the life of the machine.

Avoid contact with materials
You should only come into contact with the materials when cleaning the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Explosion danger because of nitrate
Fertilisers hat contain nitrate can create an explosion danger if they come into contact with fire. All fertiliser remnants should therefore be removed from voids, corners, tubes and tubing before welding, cutting or grinding on the machine. Explosions could cause damage to the machine and lead to personal injury.
Prevent unintentional operation
Render all parts that could contain residual energy safe, as well as all parts that conduct energy such as compressed air, hydraulics and electricity. Release all pressure from the system and disconnect the pipes and cables. Unintended operation could lead to injury.<|begin_of_text|>

This rotary type spreader has two spreading discs. Each has eight by a dosing plate on top of the spreading disc. Both of the dosing
vanes. They are mounted level so that the fertiliser is spread over the land in a constant horizontal flow. The spreading quantity is regulated plates are located right on top of the discharge bushings. The fertiliser falls on the turning spreading disc. The discharge point is determined by the opening in the discharge bushing behind the vanes. This means that the fertiliser granules are already turning before they come into contact with the vanes on the spreading disc. This prevents granules from breaking apart and becoming powdery. The agitator mounted below in the hopper provides for a constant stream of fertiliser dust, seeds or granules to the dosing opening(s). Moreover, the agitator prevents the chunks of fertiliser from blocking
one or more dosing openings.

The spreader has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently of each other. Moreover, it is possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings so that the application rate can also be set precisely with a low flowrate, while the risk of blockages remains limited.
The machine is equipped with two actuators, which service a dosing plate each, in order to set the application rate. This actuator can open the dosing plate in every required position. In this way, accurate dosing independent of the driving speed is possible. It is also possible to control the dosing setting with external sensors, for example, a nitrogen sensor.
 See paragraph »Application rate« on page 66.
The actuators are controlled by means of the spreader software. By means of weight sensors, the spreader continuously measures the discharge volumes and corrects it as needed with the application rate. If you want to close on one side, you can choose the function on the control box, after which one of the two dosing plates will be closed immediately.
Normal dosing
For precise dosing over a wide range of settings, a spreader with 3 openings is applied per disc.
Fine application
The spreader is equipped with a fine spreader as standard equipment to spread low application rates. This fine spreader can be adjusted with a lever per dosing unit.
Low application rates require a small dosing opening. In order
· to finely adjust the settings
· and to counter the blockage
a transition to the opening, which is open wider, is desirable.
2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed when using the fine dosing setting.
The fertiliser now flows through one opening that is opened wider, giving an accurate, reliable flow, also at low application rate.<|begin_of_text|>

Width distribution with GEOSPREAD
Actuator for discharge point adjustment
[Image: Actuator for discharge point adjustment]
Combined control with GEOSPREAD system
Discharge point letter setting
[Image]
The spreading pattern is determined by the transverse distribution.
The discharge point is the place where the fertiliser granules come into touch with the vanes of the spreading disc and substantially determines width distribution.
Actuators for setting the discharge point
The GEOSPREAD execution has two additional actuators which set the discharge point. The discharge point setting depends on the fertiliser type and the flowrate in kg/min.
The letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate is given in the spreading chart. The spreading computer determines the correct setting with the input working and spreading chart data.
Spreading pattern form
The spreading pattern is normally a triangle that completely overlaps. A trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate. This spreading pattern has an overlapping area of less than 100%.
Reducing working width during the pass
The control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.
The spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this.

No additional licence key is required.
.
 See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual
MULTIRATE can be used on your ISOBUS weighing spreader.
An additional licence key is required to enable the software module.
MULTIRATE automatically adjusts the amount of fertiliser per side. The application rate to the left and right is independently based on a rate map.
You can do this on the basis of a maximum of 8 measuring points of the rate map.
This is a combined functionality between the spreader and the terminal, providing the option of using two or more variable quantities in the working width of the spreader.
A total of 8 VRA sections are supported by the spreader.
To achieve full functionality with the IsoMatch PRO Terminal, you also need the IsoMatch GEOCONTROL licence key.
When MULTIRATE signals are received, the following icon is visible.
 See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual
The ISOBUS supports the Farmfacts Greeseeker sensor. From Greenseeker version 06.00.00.0257 onwards, the software supports the reception of the external signal. Section control continues working through the Task Controller.

Boundary track spreading with ExactLine
It is possible to spread right up to the border (boundary track spreading) from the first sprayer tramline with ExactLine.
A ExactLine is available for the right and the left.
Selecting the pattern for border spreading
It is not possible to completely cover the field border at the application rate and not have anything go beyond the border. Current environmental standards only allow for minimal loss over the field edge.
ExactLine
ExactLine bends the fertiliser granules in such a way that loss over the edge of the border is restricted to the bare minimum and it provides as full a spreading pattern as possible.
ExactLine has 'environment' and 'yield' settings for precisely adjusting border spreading.

The ISO control system
The automatic weighing system
The ISO control system uses the ISOBUS communication protocol, which makes it suitable for tractors that are also equipped with an ISOBUS communication system. For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.
The spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.
 See the software instruction manual.
The working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands. Field data imported from a new management system or a newly created field boundary is used for this purpose.

Getting familiar with the machine
The computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate with the following formula:
Flowrate required = (kg/min)
Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)
600
Automatic Calibration test
With the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute, the computer determines what dosing setting corresponds with what flowrate. This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all. A shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.
 See the software instruction manual.
Use spreading chart
To determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate, the computer needs at least 1 measuring point. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.
To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.
If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.

ISOBUS tractor connection
The switching functions and data transfer between the tractor terminal or ISO control box and the machine are operated via the ISOBUS. Specifically tilling the site and reacting to deviating field forms or soil compositions is possible through ISOBUS communication. With GPS, various sensors and management systems are provided with the necessary information in order to control the machine optimally.
ISOBUS functionality via IsoMatch
Tractors without their own ISO terminal can work as ISO tractors with the IsoMatch control box.
Driving speed, RPM and GPS signal on IsoMatch
If speed is not measured on the (trailed) machine, but via the tractor, the speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics. A special cable set is required for this.
 See paragraph »Directly to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection in the tractor cabin« on page 144.
The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM. The extra sensor is available for this purpose.
The GPS signal can also be used via the RS 232 on the control box. This is required for the GEOCONTROL functionality.
 Also, refer to the manual that comes with your control box.
Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set
If the tractor does not have an ISOBUS communication, it can be added with the IsoMatch power cable set.
Hereafter, your tractor is entirely ISOBUS ready, and you can connect and operate the machine with the IsoMatch control box.
The driving speed of your tractor (or your trailed machine) is transmitted via the ISOBUS to the IsoMatch.
The "IM Tellus Input" cable, supplied as a standard item, can be used for other connections.<|begin_of_text|>

The coupling shaft provided is too long for most types of tractors
The coupling shaft must be cut to the correct length before connecting it to the tractor. A coupling shaft that is too long could lead to serious damage to the machine and the tractor.
 See the paragraph »Checking the coupling shaft length« below
 and the below paragraph »Shortening the coupling shaft«.
During lifting and lowering of the power lift, the coupling shaft requires adequate space for:
· sliding in and out,
· sufficient overlap between the profiled tubes when driving the machine in the extreme operating angle of the coupling shaft.
Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine
This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.
The length of the coupling shaft and the shortening thereof must be done after the power lift has been connected, but before the coupling shaft has been connected.
 Lift the machine with the power lift until the PTO shaft and the machine drive axle are level.
This is the shortest possible length between the two shafts.
 Place the machine on a supporting beam.
 Switch the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the coupling shaft for it to be two halves.
 Mount the loose tractor section of the coupling shaft to the tractor PTO shaft.
 Attach the loose machine component of the coupling shaft to the drive axle.
 Manually align the two coupling shaft halves.
 Check the length and adjust it as described below.<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 51===

Shortening the coupling shaft
[Image]

Before first use
The profiled tubes must overlap as far as possible, with a minimum of 150 mm.
The profiled tubes must however have at least 25 mm free clearance at the outer edges when the tractor PTO shaft and the machine drive axle are level.
 Cut off the two profiled tubes to achieve the 25 mm clearance.
 Deburr both ends.
 Clean the coupling shaft.
 Shorten the protection sleeves by the same length.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Connect the coupling shaft of the machine and the tractor.
 Lift the machine with the power lift in the highest operating position.
Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine
This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.
The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30 ° when lifted and 30 ° when lowered.This is the maximum length between the PTO shaft and the machine drive axle.
 Place the machine on a supporting beam wit the power lift in the highest position.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Check if the furthest working angle is less than 30 °.
 Check that the overlap of the profiled tubes is still at least 150 mm.
 Remove the tractor section.
 Apply grease to the profiled tubes.
 Attach the protection sleeves.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Mount the coupling shaft to the machine.
Always mount the check chains of the protection sleeves
The check chains prevent the protection sleeves from rotating with the coupling shaft. Crop or pieces of clothing can be wound around rotating protection sleeves and cause material damage and possibly severe physical injury.
 Mount the check chains to both outer edges of the coupling shaft protective sleeves.

Neutralise the controls
Control devices, e.g. ropes, hoses, etc. for remote actuation of devices such as cylinders, shall be guided and positioned in a way they never inadvertently release nor block desired movements/actuations! Unintentional movements can lead to serious injury.
Connecting and disconnecting safely
There are risks of injury involved in connecting and disconnecting the machine. Work carefully:
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· a mobile machine must also be protected from rolling away while being connected,
· the machine should only be connected and disconnected from the tractor on a firm, dry and flat surface so that the machine would not tilt and/or sink into the ground,
· ensure no other people are in the immediate vicinity of the tractor or the machine,
· work in accordance with the guidelines provided in this user's manual
· a power lift that conforms with the regulations must be used,
· never stand between the tractor and machine while the power lift is operated externally while connecting or disconnecting the machine,
· the machine must only be connected to the points intended for that purpose,
· the machine must only be connected or disconnected while the PTO shaft is off,
· check the state of the machine in order to ensure that it can safely be operated and transported.
Connecting or disconnecting the machine in an unsafe manner could lead to serious personal injury and damage to the machine.
Always mount the check chains of the protection sleeves
The check chains prevent the protection sleeves from rotating with the coupling shaft. Crop or pieces of clothing can be wound around rotating protection sleeves and cause material damage and possibly severe physical injury.
Check the coupling shaft
Check the following points before the PTO shaft is attached. Has the coupling shaft:
· no damage, including the protection sleeves?
· are there sufficient lubricants as prescribed?
· is the prescribed overlap of the coupling shaft halves and protection sleeves, both in transport and in operating position?
· Are the protection sleeves attached with chains to a fixed point to guard against turning?
An unsafe or improperly mounted coupling shaft could lead to serious or deadly injury.
If the coupling shaft does not comply with the points mentioned above, it must be replaced before using the machine.

Stabiliser chain
Front power lift
Connecting to the tractor
There is an option of two tension levels, depending on the height of the crop. The high hitch points are for normal use, the low hitch points are used if the maximum lifting height of the tractor is not sufficient to ensure that the spreading height is 75 cm above the crop.
The low hitch points are also used when fertilising high crops, which is known as top dressing.
For further adjustments with top dressing, see
 paragraph »Spreading height« on page 95.
The space between the spreader and the tractor is limited as far as possible in order to keep the centre of gravity as closely to the tractor as possible. This promotes stability and the road behaviour of the tractor. As a result the coupling shaft, hydraulic hoses and electric plugs must be connected first, followed by the power lift.
 Move the tractor to the front of the spreader so that the catch hooks of the power lift are around 200 mm from the spreader (the maximum distance depends on the reach of the coupling shaft; the halves must always overlap each other).
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system of the tractor.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Put the lower links of the tractor level with the machine linkage pins.
 Compensate for any height difference with the lift rod adjustment of the power lift.
 Adjust the stabiliser chains to make lateral movement of the lower links impossible.
 Mount the appropriate ball bearings to the linkage pins and the top.
 Secure the linkage pins and top again.
Only connect the machine to the front power lift if:
· it has sufficient lifting power,
· it falls within the same fixing category as the machine,
· with linkage frame (optional extras) for tractors with power lift of Cat. 3 / 4,
· the minimum and maximum load of the front and rear weight would not be exceeded,
· the tractor has a closed cabin and proper air filters (active carbon filters).

Check the decoupling ropes of the quick coupling
The decoupling ropes must never be tense and must provide sufficient freedom for movement, even with the power lift in the lowest position as it could otherwise accidentally disconnect the quick coupling. Accidental disconnection could cause damage to the machine and may lead to personal injury.
 Start the tractor again.
 Reverse carefully so that the catch hooks of the lower links are exactly under the ball bearings.
 Open the quick coupling of the catch hooks with the release ropes.
 Engage the power lift until the ball bearings are correctly located in the catch hooks and close the quick coupling.
 Check if the catch hooks have locked correctly by lowering the power lift carefully.
 Turn the top link to the appropriate length and secure if possible.
 Open the quick coupling of the catch hook with the release rope.
 Let the catch hook fall over the ball bearing at the top and close the quick coupling.
 Check if the catch hook is correctly secured by pushing and pulling it.
Always check the machine after connection and set it horizontally if required.
 Lift the spreader until it is lifted from the ground or ramp.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Check the locking system of the catch hooks of the lower links and the top link.
 Make sure that the electric cables and hydraulic hoses do not get jammed. Lead them or tie them up in order to prevent dangerous situations. Make sure that there is sufficient space for movement when lifting or lowering the machine.
 Adjust the machine so that it is level with the lift rod adjustment.
 Turn the top link until the machine is standing horizontally.
 Lock the top link when that is possible.<|begin_of_text|>

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
The data for the correct setting of your spreader can be found in the spreading charts in the spreading chart book and the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.
 See also paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
The spreading charts indicate what type of fertiliser is best suited to achieving a good distribution. Correct adjustment depends on the characteristics of the fertiliser, not the brand! Determine the characteristics of the fertiliser, therefore, and find the spreading chart with similar features. Use the chart, even if the brand of the fertiliser differs from the nearest comparable fertiliser!
Select the spreading chart based on the characteristics of the fertiliser and not on the brand!
In order to find the correct spreading chart in the spreading chart book, online spreading chart service on the website, or via the free application (App) on your mobile phones, you must collect the following physical properties of the fertiliser
· type and pattern of the granules
 see the paragraph below,»Determine the type and pattern of the granules«
· distribution (= composition of granules of various sizes),
 see paragraph »Determining distribution« on page 59,
· similar weight,
 See paragraph »Determining similar weight« on page 60.
Distribution is the most vital characteristic of the fertiliser when it comes to spreading. You can make the first selection from the (online) spreading charts based on the distribution. Never use a spreading chart for another type of fertiliser, even if the distribution is very similar! You can determine which spreading chart compares the best to the fertiliser you are using based on similar weight.
Select the type of fertiliser from the spreading chart that is closest to the type of fertiliser that you are using.
The characteristics of the various types of fertiliser are so far reaching that using a spreading chart for another type of fertiliser, even if the distribution is the same, could provide a bad spreading pattern and could harm the crop!

Determining distribution
[Image]

[Image]
To be done before spreading
The distribution is the ratio of granules with different diameters. A distribution meter comes with every spreader. This meter has 4 sections, with seven parts. The seven have different mesh width that divide the fertiliser granules, based on their diameters.
Distribution of 0-70-30-0 indicates none of the granules has a diameter of less than 2.0 mm, 70% have a diameter between 2.0 - 3.3 mm, 30% have a diameter between 3.3 - 4.75 mm and none is larger than 4.75 mm.
You should therefore do the following to determine the distribution of the fertiliser with the distribution meter:
 Fill the slot that reads 4.75 mm and close the other openings with the cover.
 Close the distribution meter with the cover and keep it on its side.
 Shake it for as long as no more smaller granules are falling through the sieves.
 Turn the distribution meter back up and read the content of each slot. The given percentages should add up to 100%. It could be necessary to round the readings off with small and round granules.
 Repeat the steps above three times and then determine the average distribution.
TIP Fill the fraction meter from another part of the hopper in order to obtain a good average as the larger granules tend to roll to the outer part of the hopper.
TIP Clean the seven parts regularly in order to prevent them from getting blocked.
[Image]
The last figure indicates how you can read the following distribution: 0-70-30-0
Indication with regard to the distribution:
· If the diameter of 10% or more of the fertiliser granules is smaller than 2.0 mm the fertiliser type would be difficult to spread, especially with large working widths. This could result in a less than optimal distribution and could damage the crops.
· If the diameter of 80 - 100% of the fertiliser granules is between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertiliser would be good to spread, irrespective of the size of the remaining granules.
· If the diameter of 20% or more of the fertiliser granules is greater than 4.75 mm it would be difficult for optimum distribution. This could lead to damage to the crops as the granules could make holes in the leaves of the crop.

Determining similar weight
[Image]
Finding the correct spreading chart
60
The density is the weight (kg) of 1 litre of fertiliser and it is expressed as kg/litre or ton/m3.
The following material is required to determine the density:
· measuring beaker (supplied),
· scale (supplied).
 Refer to the scale manual.
Working method to determine similar weight:
 Hang the empty and dry measuring beaker on the scale.
 Press the scale to 0.
 Fill the measuring beaker.
 Knock the measuring beaker 5 times on firm ground.
 Fill up the measuring beaker.
 Weigh the fertiliser.
 Repeat the steps above three times in order to determine the average weight.
Density of at least 1 kg/l is desirable for a good distribution of the fertiliser. Lighter types of fertiliser would be more difficult to spread and the maximum working width would be limited.
On the basis of the data you collected about your fertiliser, for the spreading chart of fertiliser with the best comparable properties and desired working width in the table of contents of your spreading chart book, or fill in the data through the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.  see paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on the following page.
You can find the settings for the spreader, based on the application rate and the driving speed.
 See then paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
TIP the page indicated in the table of index of the spreading chart book indicates the settings for the smallest desirable working width. The spreading charts for larger working widths are on the pages that follow those.<|begin_of_text|>

To be done before spreading
Information about the settings of the spreader can be found in the
spreading chart book, but also via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system. This will also provide information about additional types of fertiliser that have been tested recently. You can make use of the online spreading chart service as an alternative to the spreading chart book. You must enter the characteristics of the fertiliser, your working width, application rate, driving speed and the type of fertiliser. You will then receive advice from the website for setting your spreader: dosing setting, discharge point, flowrate, vane combination and angle of the spreader.
Methods for adjusting the spreader can be found at:  chapter »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
Also check the advice given on the online spreading chart service. Do a calibration test to check the dosing setting. Then check the spreading pattern with a tray test.
 See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.
You can reach the spreading chart service as follows:
 Go to the website of the Kverneland Group: http://www.Kvernelandspreadingcharts.com.
 The various languages are given at the top of the page.
 Start the spreading chart service and complete the details required.
 The spreading chart service will then request that you select a product with comparable characteristics.
 The spreading chart service will then indicate the settings for your spreader. Follow the working methods as described in
 paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
AutosetApp gives you the option to download these spreading charts to the IsoMatch Tellus terminal in order to set the spreader automatically. After choosing the desired fertiliser type, the working width, application rate, driving speed, dosing and discharge opening are transmitted to the spreader using the AutosetApp. The spreader then automatically gets the correct setting. Automatic adjustment of the discharge point only applies to GEOSPREAD spreaders. The same data may be transmitted to the spreader via the AutosetApp for the other weighing spreader models such as Exacta-CL EW and Exacta-TL(X). Except for the discharge opening, the spreader then has to be set manually.
Using the Kverneland Group spreading charts application, you can easily find the right settings for your spreader.
The spreading charts application gives you immediate access to the most up-to-date test results of fertiliser.
In just a few steps, the application will lead you to the correct settings for your spreader, any time of the day, wherever you want for almost any type of fertiliser.
The spreading chart application (App) can be downloaded free of charge through the Apple App Store and/or through the Google Play Store.

Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with the materials could lead to personal injury.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully while making adjustments:
· switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with filling, adjusting or testing,
· Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured spreader,
· Comply carefully with the instructions.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
Set the spreader based on the details obtained from the correct spreading chart, the desired application rate (kg/ha) and the driving speed (km/h).
You can find the methods for determining the correct spreading chart in
 the instruction manual of the software.
The spreading chart page contains information about the fertiliser to which this chart relates. Here you will also find the settings you need to perform in respect of your spreader:<|begin_of_text|>

To be done before spreading
Working width
The working width must be selected to set the spreader. This could for instance be the distance between the sprayer tramlines.
In the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system, look for the page that shows the desired working width of the fertiliser type with the most similar properties.
Various types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.
If you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres. Enter the actual working width into the control system so that the selected application rate is correctly distributed.
The working width is adjusted with:

To be done before spreading
It is necessary to correctly set the discharge point in order to obtain a good spreading pattern and the correct working width. The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.
The discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point, of the spreading chart.
Always check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).
 see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.
In the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.
You can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.
TIP Set the spreader angle before you fill the hopper. It is easier to adjust the top link if the hopper is empty.
Check the position again after the hopper has been filled!
If the inclination is at 4 o of 8 o, the spreader area slides further behind the spreader.
 In the machine data screen, increase the length B by 10% or 20% at 4 o or 8 o.
 Please refer to the software instruction manual for the procedure.
The (online) spreading chart shows the rpm of the spreading discs as well as the rpm of the PTO shaft. The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.
The PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones. Use the connection point shown in the spreading chart.

Application rate
Constant application rate
[Image]
[Image]
[Image]
The control system can drive the spreader in three different ways:
· distribution that resembles the settings for the preset application rate must be determined under changing circumstances through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,
 see the paragraph below,»Constant application rate«.
with similar or lower application rates (< 40 kg/min) the fine application kit should be used,
 See paragraph »Fine application« on page 67.
· with very low application rates on very uneven terrain, preset application rates must be checked manually to ensure that the correct dosing setting is being distributed, without automatic calibration but with driving speed correction,
· under changing circumstances location specific application rate driven by an external signal, through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,
 See paragraph »Variable, externally driven application rate« on page 72.
The control system can spread an equal amount of fertiliser over the entire field. In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.
The control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.
 See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.
Look for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:
 Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.
 The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.
 The given values are to be entered in the control system.
If the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate. If the selected driving speed is not given, use the settings closest to the selected driving speed.

To be done before spreading
All three dosing openings normally open uniformly with the selected application rate and the corresponding flowrate that you set. With a low application rate and/or a low driving speed the dosing openings are only opened a slight bit so that very little fertiliser would stream through the dosing openings of the spreader. This could easily cause blockage, which would lead to a bad spreading pattern and possible damage the crops.
We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.
The flowrate with a specific working width, application rate and driving speed is given in the fourth column of the spreading chart.
If very low application rates (less than 25 kg/ha) are to be distributed, e.g. only a few kilograms per hectare, the control system cannot perform automatic calibrations. The distributed weight is too small to accurately adjust the application rate.
Close 2 of the 3 dosing openings to prevent blockages. The remaining opening must be further opened as the application rate with the constant flowrate would be three times as much.
The handle to close 2 of the 3 fine dosing openings is located at the outside of the spreading disc, above a similar handle for the discharge point. You will find the indications on top of the fine application handle for the number of dosing openings: 3 open holes for standard dosing and 1 open hole and 2 thick holes for fine application.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Pull the hand-grip of the fine application lever out.
 Set the fine application handle until the arrow on the hand-grip indicates the desired position.
 Let go of the hand-grip and check if the fine application handle is locked.
 Set the fine application lever on the other spreading disc in the same way to the same position.

The dosing setting to be set can be:
· Read from the relevant spreading chart when you want to spread at a lower application rate using the fine application kit and the symbol of the Fine application kit is indicated in the spreading chart. This is indicated by means of 1 open hole (dosing opening).
· Determine an application rate not given as described in paragraph »Discharge point«from page 65.
· To be calculated using the relevant spreading chart when you wish to spread at a lower application rate with the fine application kit, and the Fine application kit symbol is indicated in the spreading chart; it is indicated using 3 open holes (dosage opening).
Calculation
As 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed the flowrate of the remaining dosing opening should be three times as much in order to obtain an even application rate.
 Read the Dosing Setting, Discharge Point and Flowrate from the spreading chart. Calculate the flowrate with the formula given below as required.
If the selected application rate or driving speed is not indicated in the spreading chart the required flowrate can also be calculated as follows:
flowrate required (kg/min) =
Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)
600
Use the letter given for setting the discharge point in the line of the spreading chart that most closely resembling the calculated flowrate.
 Multiply the flowrate (given in the Kg/min column or calculated) with a factor of 3.
 Select the closest flowrate for the whole spreader in the Kg/min column.
 Read off the relevant dosing setting or estimate it as closely as possible.

The control system provides the options to distribute the same application rate all over the field and the option to spread a variable, externally driven application rate. This provides the option to spread as per requirements, e.g. through a nitrogen sensor.
An application rate that had been preset in the corresponding management system for the relevant field can also be entered through the GPS system.
 For the options and corresponding settings, see the user's manuals for the external system and the control box, e.g. the IsoMatch. The control system of the spreader in combination with the IsoMatch control box also transmits the application rate and working width used back to the external system.
The external system and the control system of a spreader with an IsoMatch control box communicate through a serial port with an RS 232 connection. This connection is located at the back of the control box. The occupation of pins in the 9-point RS 232 plug and the settings required are given in

Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You could come into contact with materials when filling the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Chemical reactions caused by mixing fertilisers
Mixing different types of fertiliser could lead to a chemical reaction whereby poisonous vapours, liquids or other materials could come about. Possible danger of explosion! This could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.
Only mix different types of fertiliser if allowed by the manufacturer(s).
Chemical reactions could lead to damage to the machines and personal injury.
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and apply that. Protective clothing should be worn when necessary.
Disregarding the safety instructions could result in personal injury and damage to the machine.
Use proper tools
Great volumes of material is often handled during the filling process. Use proper tools such as lifting devices when moving and filling the machine. Keep legislation concerning working conditions in mind. Work carefully and responsibly. Inferior tools can cause serious inju-
ries.
Only fill mounted machines
Never place a machine in the ground while filling it. Always keep it in the power lift of the tractor. The machine is designed to be loaded while in a suspended state. Never park a filled machine on the ground. Filling the machine while it is on the ground could lead to damage.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.

INDICATION
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
You can fill the spreader to the desired levels after it has been put in place. It is recommended that the machine be loaded while it is lifted 10 cm above the soil. If no activities need to be performed on top of the hopper, the height can be adjusted with the automatic filling system.
A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in
 paragraph »Technical specifications« on page 36.
 If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.
 Lower the machine at the desired level. The machine must not rest on the ground, but rather be lifted a minimum distance of 10 cm!
 Check if the dosing units are closed. Close them if necessary by pressing the stop key on the main screen.
The position of the dosing units is displayed in the main screen on the control box of the control system.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Place wheel chocks in front of the wheels of the tractor.
 If a mobile loading platform is being used, place the loading platform at the spreader so that there would be a maximum distance of 200 mm between the two.
 Open the hopper cover.
 Check if the sieve is closed and secured.
 Fill the machine to the desired level with the correct tools. Fill the hopper halves to the same level so that the both of them would run empty at the same time.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Work carefully while filling and take the regulations that apply to working conditions into consideration! Make sure no objects or tools fall into the hopper. as it could block or damage the spreader!
 Close the hopper cover.
Do not exceed the maximum recommended weight!  See also »Technical specifications« on page 36. The machine has not been constructed to carry the additional weight. Keep the axle load, load capacity of the wheels and the total weight of the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted
machines« on page 13.
INDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.
INDICATION
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

Spreading pattern check (tray test)
76
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!
Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.
Tray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.
We recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
When to perform the tray test:
· When using a fertiliser type that is not in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using a fertiliser type of which the distribution and density deviate from the values indicated in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using fertiliser of moderate quality.
· Test should be carried out annually on the left and the right side to check the equal distribution of both spreading discs.
· After each change to the spreading mechanism of the spreader or when parts are replaced.
Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test. The tray test should be performed with dry weather, low humidity and with a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2).
Material required
· measuring tape or ruler,
· spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
· 7 troughs,
· 7 graduated tubes,
· 1 funnel,
· notebook, pen and calculator,
· this manual.
· the instruction manual of the software.
General instructions
 Check the preset dosing setting and the discharge point.
 Check the height (75 cm above the troughs) and the position (angle) of the spreader.
 Check the rpm of the PTO shaft and the spreader discs.
 Always place the buckets horizontally on the floor.
 Place the buckets at a maximum distance of 4 metres. Provide additional widths for testing widths of more than 24 meters. Also, you can first test part of the working width and then empty the trays and distribute them over the rest of the working width.
 Do not use the spreader while it is raining or with high humidity. This will cause the fertiliser to cling to the troughs, which would not provide the desired results.
 Do not spread with wind speeds of more than 3 m/s (wind force of 2).

Test the left and right spreading patterns
INDICATION
[Image]
The left and right spreading discs must spread the same volumes of fertiliser to ensure good distribution. Check this every year!
This test describes a working width of 24 metres. You are of course free to run the test for a different working width. Divide the buckets at equal distances along the working width.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the left spreading disc by sliding the connector to he left. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Search the correct discharge position to spread over 24 metres in the best comparable fertiliser, seeds or granules (online) spreading chart and set the handle accordingly.
 See paragraph »Discharge point« on page 65 and the foreword of the spreading chart book.
 Fit the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point of the central gearbox as indicated in the associated spreading chart.
 See paragraph »Coupling shaft connection point« on page 64.
 Check the height of the spreader (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
 Place the other troughs 4 metres to the right of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!

To be done before spreading
 Start the tractor again.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Switch the control box on.
 Enter the required application rate.
 Enter the working width.
It is recommended that an application rate of at least 250 kg/ha is entered with the selected driving speed.
 Switch on the left spreading disc.
 Switch off the automatic calibration.
 Engage the PTO shaft and set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 Open the right dosing unit.
 Drive over the first trough and stop only after you have driven at least 20 metres past this trough. This is because the spreader distributes roughly even to the back, front and to the side.
 Close the dosing unit.
 Empty the trough with a funnel into the graduated tubes and record the reading in your notebook.
Repeat the above procedure, but disconnect the right spreading disc and switch the dosing unit of the right spreading disc off. Put the troughs on the left side of the tractor track.
Drive with the same speed and with the same PTO shaft rpm as with the first time!

Assessment
 Record the values you find in the graduated tubes for the left and right spreading discs.
 Compare the values, calculate the percentage differences between the measuring tubes on the left and the right.
Adaptation
If the spreading patterns on the left and right spreading discs are not the same and the difference is greater than 3% you will have to do the following, or request your dealer to do so:
 Check if the machine is hanging horizontally and vertically behind the tractor in length and width.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the dosing mechanism« as described on page 133 and repeat the test.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism« as described on page 136 and repeat the test.
If the difference in the spreading pattern is too great, contact your dealer.

Full field spreading pattern test
[Image]
To be done before spreading
If the spreader is correctly set and the tramlines are set at the correct distance from each other you would achieve a good distribution of fertiliser over the land. This will only be achieved if the spreader spreads with the correct spreading pattern.
This is then the reason why you have to test the spreading pattern and adjust it as required.
 See also paragraph »Full field spreading pattern« on page 28.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width (X metre) that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
 Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.
The actual width is twice the size of the effective working width!
If you want to spread over a working width of 24 metres, place the buckets at 24/6 metres = 4 metres.

Testing the spreading pattern of the hydraulic border spreading plate
Always perform a calibration test first and determine the correct dosing setting before checking the spreading pattern. Changes to the dosing setting will also have an influence on the spreading pattern!  See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.
[Image]
When using the border spreading plate the aim is to obtain maximum distribution to the border with minimum loss in the ditch.
This is then why the border spreading plate has to be tested. Do not perform this test next to the ditch, rather mark a line behind which the fictive ditch will be.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right or left spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right or left. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Close the dosing unit of the right or left spreading disc.
INDICATION Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!
[Image]
 Set the spreader in accordance with the spreading chart for the desired working width and the instructions given in the 'One-sided boundary spreading" chapter (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place 1 trough in the middle of the tractor tracks. The centre of the driving track must be 2 metres from the line behind which the fictive ditch is located.
