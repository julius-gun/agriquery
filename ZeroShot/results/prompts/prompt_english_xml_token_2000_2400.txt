     the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted</text><text>machines« on page 13.</text><text>INDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.</text><text>INDICATION</text><text>If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.</text><text>75</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="76"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Spreading pattern check (tray test)</text><text>76</text><text>Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material</text><text>You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.</text><text>Be careful that nothing gets jammed</text><text>It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:</text><text>· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,</text><text>· engage the parking brake of the tractor,</text><text>· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,</text><text>· carefully follow the instructions given.</text><text>Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.</text><text>The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!</text><text>Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.</text><text>Protecting the environment</text><text>Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.</text><text>PTO shaft rotates after disengaging</text><text>After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.</text><text>Work with a closed cabin</text><text>Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.</text><text>A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.</text><text>Tray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.</text><text>We recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.</text><image /></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="77"><image /><text>INDICATION</text><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>When to perform the tray test:</text><text>· When using a fertiliser type that is not in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.</text><text>· When using a fertiliser type of which the distribution and density deviate from the values indicated in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.</text><text>· When using fertiliser of moderate quality.</text><text>· Test should be carried out annually on the left and the right side to check the equal distribution of both spreading discs.</text><text>· After each change to the spreading mechanism of the spreader or when parts are replaced.</text><text>Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test.

Provide additional widths for testing widths of more than 24 meters. Also, you can first test part of the working width and then empty the trays and distribute them over the rest of the working width.</text><text> Do not use the spreader while it is raining or with high humidity. This will cause the fertiliser to cling to the troughs, which would not provide the desired results.</text><text> Do not spread with wind speeds of more than 3 m/s (wind force of 2).</text><text>77</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="78"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Test the left and right spreading patterns</text><text>INDICATION</text><image /><text>The left and right spreading discs must spread the same volumes of fertiliser to ensure good distribution.
