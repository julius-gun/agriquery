To be done before spreading
If the spreader is correctly set and the tramlines are set at the correct distance from each other you would achieve a good distribution of fertiliser over the land. This will only be achieved if the spreader spreads with the correct spreading pattern.
This is then the reason why you have to test the spreading pattern and adjust it as required.
 See also paragraph »Full field spreading pattern« on page 28.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width (X metre) that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
 Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.
The actual width is twice the size of the effective working width!
If you want to spread over a working width of 24 metres, place the buckets at 24/6 metres = 4 metres.

 Engage the PTO shaft and set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 Drive along the tracks and open the dosing units a few metres before you drive over the first bucket in the middle by pressing the start key.
 Only stop spreading after you have driven at least one working width over the troughs (e.g. 18 or 24 metres). This is because the spreader distributes roughly even to the back, front and to the side.
 Close the dosing units.
 Drive back in the next track, over trough 7. Maintain the same distance with opening and closing the dosing units. Keep to the same driving speed and PTO shaft rpm!
 If you set an application rate of less than 250 kg/ha, drive to and from over the same tracks in order to collect sufficient fertiliser in the troughs for a good comparison.

Operation
 Do not change the position of the border spreading plate and disconnect the right or left spreading disc.
With the first time:
 Do not change the settings of the spreader, the PTO shaft rpm or the driving speed as these should be the same as settings for border spreading.
With the second time:
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Set the spreader for full field spreading.

Observe the permissible and safe height with regard to
· prescribed maximum height for vehicles in the road traffic regulations,
· high-voltage cables or other cables over the road;
· anticipated maximum headroom.
Pay close attention to these aspects to prevent dangerous situations that could lead to major material damage and possibly to serious physical injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check whether the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (<40km/h) on your tractor, is hidden by the implement.

Friction between moving parts
Be careful of moving parts making contact with each other while working. You could accidentally touch control levers and cause the machine to move.
Only start working once all machine parts have stopped and the control lever have been secured. Wear safety shoes and gloves and work alone. If something gets jammed it could lead to personal injury.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.<|begin_of_text|>

INDICATION
Use in the field
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist weather conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Before you can make the first pass, you must make adjustments in the field to:
The following is important to ensure that the spreader works properly:
· set it to the correct height from the ground or above the crop and
· by levelling it with the lift rod adjustment and top link.
Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.
 Use the power lift to lift the machine to the correct height.
 Set the spreader horizontally with the lift rod adjustment and the top link.
 Lock the lift limiter in this position.
Height correction with top dressing
If the required height of 75 cm above the crop is not possible with your power lift
 use the high spreading setting of the linkage pins and/or
 set the spreader forward as indicated in the spreading charts.

 Do this last check to ensure good spreading results.
Are you working with the correct settings from the correct spreading chart, based on:
· distribution,
· similar weight,
· type of fertiliser,
· desired working width,
· desired driving speed?
Did you set the spreader in the correct way? Did you:
· set the height over the ground or crops to 75 cm?
· was the correct vane combination mounted?
· are the correct number of dosing openings opened (fine application)?
· is the correct discharge point set?
· is the correct application rate set?
· is the correct GEOPOINT® (centre spreading pattern) set?
· is the coupling shaft fitted to the correct point on the gearbox?
· is the ExactLine or hydraulic border spreading plate in the transport setting (or working position)?
· are the data required entered in the control system?
Did you check the following settings:
Did you:
· have you checked the control system settings?
· perform a tray test to check the spreading pattern?
Work in the correct manner:
· Is the field data selected or input correctly?
· Is the GEOCONTROL application setting correct?
· Have you correctly set the offset?

Working with the GEOCONTROL
Starting a new task is done from a saved field or one to be created newly with the GEOCONTROL application.
 Refer to the GEOCONTROL manual in your terminal for this purpose.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass. The headland will act as the field boundary and is saved in GEOCONTROL.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass.
 Spread a broad or double headland so that you make the connection while driving straight before making a turn.
Thereafter, the field can be filled in full passes. You can create a (spray)track pattern for following processes.
Prevent drive errors
It is important that the spreading patterns overlap well to ensure good distribution. A difference in the overlapping is less vital with average working widths, using a triangular spreading pattern.
Differences in the spreading pattern would easily be noticed with a trapezium shape on very large working widths, in particular. The overlap of the spreading pattern is then much smaller and therefore more sensitive to mistakes.
This can be prevented by setting tramlines before hand. This can be done by setting out tramlines on the headlands and marking them with, for example, picket poles.
Visibility of the from headland to headland is very important. Place additional markers in the field if necessary to ensure that the track is clearly visible.
When controlled by the GEOCONTROL the spreader has the option of reducing the working width in order to connect the incomplete final pass with the next one.

 Check the settings as described in
 Without GEOCONTROL, select and activate a site number in the field registration,
 Switch on the PTO shaft and set the correct spreading disc rpm as reported in the spreading chart.
Do not allow the spreading disc to run for longer than is necessary while the dosing units are closed. This will prevent the agitator from grinding the fertiliser.
 Start driving and open the dosing units at the same time by pressing the start key.
The rpm of the tractor engine (therefore also of the PTO shaft) must remain constant while spreading (with regards to distributing fertiliser along the width).
The driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed!
Based on the offset set in the 'TC Implement Settings' screen, the GEOCONTROL will switch the spreading sections off by itself when passing the headland limit. This happens if the spreading pattern overlaps completely and you run up the headland.
Depending on the set overlap percentage, the connection on the headland and gores will more or less overlap.
The usual setting is 50%.

At low doses <50 kg/ha, it is possible to reduce the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration to minus 15 kg.
 See the software instruction manual.
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

Working method on the headland
102
The driving pattern that you use, in other words how you must turn on the headland, depends on your border spreading method.
· spreading the border from the sprayer tramline with ExactLine, one-sided boundary spreading with additional room with the border spreading plate (situation A), or
· border spreading by closing off one disc and using a border spreading plate (situation B).
Do the following when spreading the headland:

Over and underdosing
Results of one-sided over- or underdosing
[Image]
Use in the field
Depending on soil or crop composition, it is preferable to spread more or less fertiliser locally. With the control system, you can over- or under dose to the left, right or on both sides during spreading. You will find all the control keys on the main screen.
 See the software instruction manual.
The spreading pattern of both spreading discs overlap partially, especially in the middle behind the spreader. For this reason, the real application rate will deviate from the one that you set during one-sided over- and under dosing. You will see the effect especially with narrow working widths because that is when the spreading patterns overlap the most.
With small working widths in which you spread in a triangular spreading pattern, the first and second passes of the spreading patterns overlap each other completely.
 See also paragraph »Spreading pattern« on page 28. To distribute an adjusted application rate you must therefore over- or underdose on the first as well as the second pass in the following tramline.

Border spreading
INDICATION
106
Spreading fertiliser up to the border of the property requires concentration. On the one hand you want to achieve maximum cover to the field edge to ensure a good crop, while on the other hand you want to minimise the loss over the field edge.
The spreader has 2 different functions and accessories to cater for border spreading.
· one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate,
· boundary track spreading with ExactLine.
When one-sided boundary spreading, drive with the tractor along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. With boundary track spreading, drive down the first sprayer tramline from the field edge and spray in the direction of the border.
We advise you to spread the site first before you spread the borders. During border spreading, the control system does not perform any automatic calibration, so it cannot accurately determine the correct dosing setting for the required application rate. Consequently, the application rate can deviate from the required application rate during border spreading. By spreading the field first, the control system can determine the correct dosing setting and thus spread at the correct application rate, also during border spreading.<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 107===

One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate
Operation
[Image]
Use in the field
Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules with the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra). The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra).
Direction ( 1 ) (environmental set- ting)
Spread less to the field edge.
This will decrease the loss over the field edge, but the cover will not be as good
Direction ( 9 ) (yield setting)
Spread more to the field edge.
Cover is better, but the loss is greater
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test if the border spreading plate (optional extra) door de test therefore always before hand as described in

Procedure with hydraulic border spreading plate
[Image]
[Image]
108
Left and right border spreading is possible with the hydraulic border spreading plate.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Lower the border plate.
 Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!
 Adjust the spreader based on the details given in the spreading chart for the desired working width. Use the same settings and coupling shaft mounting point as with full field spreading,
 See also paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Start the tractor again.
 Switch the control box on.
 Engage the PTO shaft. The correct rpm of the spreading discs is the value of the relevant spreading chart.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
The control system will drive the dosing units in such a way that the actual application rate is equal to the set application rate through the lower PTO shaft RPM.
In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:
 Stop spreading immediately!
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 See then paragraph »Failure and stoppage« on page 113.
After border spreading:
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Close the dosing.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 109===

Driving pattern
Use in the field
Two different driving patterns can be used, depending on the situation on your land.
Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic border spreading plate, but disconnect the right spreading disc and close the dosing unit,
 see the methods above.
 Increase the PTO shaft rpm to 100% again.
 Drive down the second path in the first sprayer tramline.
 After the second operation, link up the right spreading disc drive again.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic spreading plate.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
 Drive up the second line 1 working width from the field edge (X metres). Maintain the distance with the field edge carefully by using pickets, for instance.

INDICATION
[Image]
[Image]
Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) (=first sprayer tramline) when doing boundary track spreading with the ExactLine (accessory). The flow of fertiliser granules, seeds or other granules spread with ExactLine. The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the ExactLine position.
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test the ExactLine therefore always in advance as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The (online) spreading charts indicate the correct setting for the ExactLine and the relevant rpm for the PTO shaft and the spreading discs.
If the settings of the ExactLine are not given in the relevant spreading chart they can be obtained in the following sources:
· find with the online spreading chart service on the website or via the Free Application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
 See paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
Always check the settings of the ExactLine by performing the test as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The type of fertiliser is determined when adjusting the spreader, as described in
 paragraph »Determine the type and pattern of the granules« on page 57.
you can choose from 3 settings from the chart:
· YIELD.
· ECO,
In the yield setting (YIELD), the loss over the field edge is higher than what is allowed by the environmental standard. Therefore, never use this setting next to surface water. Cover to the border is very good with this option.
The loss over the field edge will be equal to or less than the environment standard in the environment setting (ECO). Always use this setting when working next to a surface water! The result is that the cover at the border of the property is not optimum.

Use in the field
 Engage the ExactLine by letting the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve run for a few seconds. This is also how pressure is built in the accumulator. You will see the ExactLine symbol on the main screen. The symbol only appears when the ExactLine is in working position.
 Close the tap on the hydraulic hose to prevent the ExactLine from changing position while spreading due to a leaking tractor valve.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Do not change the settings of the spreader.
 See paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Set the ExactLine to the required position, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart.
 Start the tractor and set the correct PTO shaft and spreading discs RPM, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart or the chart on the previous page.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
 Continue operating the spreader in the same way as in full field spreading,
 See paragraph »Start spreading« on page 100.
 Check regularly while spreading to see if the symbol of the ExactLine remains on screen. If the symbol disappears the ExactLine is no longer in a good working position.
 Set the ExactLine back to transport mode after use by opening the tap in the hydraulic hose and then opening the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve for a few seconds.
The ExactLine's position is displayed on the main screen if you have connected this function.
 See the software instruction manual.
In this way, you will make fewer spreading errors caused by an incorrectly positioned ExactLine.

Causes
Use in the field
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
While working with the spreader, you might come into contact with fertiliser or other substances that you want to spread. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
During spreading, if you:
· see that a spreading disc is spreading irregularly or not at all while the dosing units are open,
· hear a loud noise,
· become aware that the machine is vibrating seriously,
· an alarm is shown on the main screen indicating that the PTO shaft is not connected, while it actually is connected,
· an alarm will appear on the main screen, indicating that the dosing units cannot be closed,
 see the software instruction manual.
Stop spreading immediately! Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!

INDICATION
These failures are probably caused by one of the following:
· a hard object blocks the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking the supply from flowing to the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking fertiliser from flowing through the dosing opening or discharge bushing,
· crushed and/or damp fertiliser forms an encrusted layer beneath the agitator and blocks the flow through the dosing openings,
· a lump of damp fertiliser has formed in the discharge bushing and is blocking flow from the discharge bushing opening. This happens especially when the spreader has not been thoroughly cleaned after it was last used.
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Handle with care
Cautiously approach the machine and handle with care. There could be hot or live parts! Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
To find the cause of the failure or stoppage and solve it as far as possible, proceed as follows.
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 Switch off the electronic control system.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the handbrake of the tractor.
Do not place the machine on the ground. Placing a filled machine on the ground damages the structure!<|begin_of_text|>

Use in the field
 Examine the spreading discs and the discharge opening to see what the cause of the failure/stoppage is.
 Adapt the discharge point as needed for easier access.
 If you still cannot see the cause, carefully remove the vanes to see better into the discharge opening of the discharge bushing.
 Pass an object such as a screwdriver through the discharge opening and carefully feel if you can find an object in or damage to the dosing openings or agitator.
If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The agitator is probably damaged too. You must first repair the damage or have it repaired before continuing with spreading.
 Place an object, for example a cloth or bag, in the discharge opening of the discharge bushing on the damaged side.. This will prevent you from wasting fertiliser during transport.
 Start the tractor and engage the control box. The dosing units will now close.
 Switch off the control box.
 Take all appropriate measures for road transport.
 See paragraph »Preparing the machine to be transported« on page 93.
On the site of a lockable storage depot:
 Empty the hopper without positioning the machine on the ground.
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
Lock the sieve in the open position
If you open the sieves, you should lock them to prevent unwanted closing. Accidental closure could lead to serious injury.
 Remove the object that caused the damage.

If you have not found any damage, the failure is probably due to stoppage from an encrusted layer of fertiliser.
 Try to reduce the size of the lump or encrusted layer with an object such as a stick, screwdriver or vane.
If you open the filters to reduce the lump or encrusted layer from the top side, you should block them to prevent unwanted closing.
If you can reduce the lump or encrusted layer in this way:
 Inspect the hopper contents for other lumps and reduce them.
 Fit the vanes and secure them with the lock nut.
 Check the discharge point setting.
 Close the hopper cover.
 Continue spreading.
If you have not managed to reduce the lump or encrusted layer because it is out of reach or there is no tool at your disposal:
 Close the hopper cover.
 Follow the working method as described in the previous paragraph »Damage« until emptying the hopper.
 Remove or reduce the lump or encrusted layer.
 If necessary, dry the hopper and the dosing mechanism.

· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protect the machine
Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan. After cleaning, inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with the supplied preserving liquid point for protection against corrosion of the
machine, read the instructions before use.
Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners
You can clean the machine with water or steam, possibly using only suitable cleaning tools. Also read here and adhere to the safety instructions of the material manufacturer.
 Only use low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.
 Keep the nozzle more than 30 cm clear of turning parts, sensors, parts of the electric system, hydraulic hoses, stickers and plastic parts.
 Only spray perpendicular to sticker edges.
Waste storage and disposal

gearboxes of the spreading discs
There is grease in the gearbox below the spreading discs. The level of the grease under the filler opening must be 35 mm when the machine has been standing still for a short time.
[Image]
 Remove dirt, fertiliser or grease from the gearbox.
 Open the gearbox by removing the cap from the filler opening.
 Measure the level of the grease.
 Add grease until the desired level is reached.
 Close the filler opening.
ply grease to the contact surfaces of both of the profiled tubes should you note during coupling or decoupling that the halves of the coupling shaft are not sliding in and out smoothly. This should at any rate be done at least once per season.
 Detach the coupling shaft on the one side.
 Pull the shaft halves away from each another.
 Grease the running surface of the inner profiled tube.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Attach the coupling shaft.
 Hook the check chains to the tractor side.
The central gearbox consists of 2 compartments filled with gear wheel grease EP 00/000. The grease in principle never needs to be replaced.
Each compartment holds 0.25 litre.
 Check the level regularly.
 Remove dirt, fertiliser or grease from the gearbox.
 Remove the cap from the dipstick and filler opening.
 Fill the gear box with new grease until it almost comes out of the opening.
Replace the cap.

Maintenance
Add oil
Connectors
The following parts only function well if they are provided with sufficient oil. Check this regularly.
The connectors between the central gearbox and the spreading disc gearboxes are used with border spreading and when checking the spreading pattern with the tray test. Disconnect one of the connectors from the spreading discs.
 Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding and becoming
difficult to use.

Checking the hydraulic system
[Image]
[Image]
Replacement intervals
Maintenance
Hydraulic oil is under high pressure
Never try to stop a leak with your fingers. Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!
Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars
Prevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working above the permitted pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.
Keep your distance from the hydraulics during inspecting and test running
Use a stick to bend the hydraulic hoses when checking them for leakage. That way you will keep at sufficient distance. Oil jets or hoses that snap back may cause serious physical injury due to the prevailing pressure and temperature.
Work safely on the hydraulic system
The hydraulic system could be under high pressure. Do not work on the hydraulic system without:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switching the tractor off,
· the key must be removed from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· using the proper tools,
· wear safety glasses, gloves and shoes.
Working in an unsafe manner on the hydraulic system could lead to injury and damage to the machine. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately! There is also the risk of infection!
Before operating the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage.
Regularly inspect the hydraulic system (hoses, pipes, connections). All hoses, piping and connecting points must be checked regularly, but at least once a year, by an expert for leakages or visible damage! The lifetime of a hose should be 6 years maximum (see the production date on the hoses).
Damaged or old parts must be replaced with new ones that comply with the technical specifications of the manufacturer of the machine. Damage to the hydraulic system could lead to injury.
131<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 132===

Maintenance
Inspection criteria
Replacing instructions
132
It is not permitted to carry out repairs on hydraulic hoses! Replace hoses if the following is detected during inspection:
· damage to the exterior up to the armouring (such as abrasion marks, cuts and tears),
· the exterior becoming brittle (tears in the hose),
· distortion not normal for the pattern of the hose while under pressure, as well as without pressure or with bends, e.g. layers pealing off and blisters forming,
· leakages,
· not mounted as per requirements,
· damage or distortion of the hose block, which would compromise the strength of the block or the connection between the hose and the regulating block,
· hose coming out of the connectors,
· corrosion of the connector which would compromise the function and strength,
· exceeding the storage and the operating limits.
Only use original parts when replacing hoses. Hoses must be placed and mounted in the proper way. Be careful not to change the connections. Replaced hoses must be suitable to the permitted work pressure and be resistant to chemical, mechanical and thermal loads. Only use hose clamps made from stainless steel.
 Run the hydraulic control valves until all the cylinders are engaged.
 Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disengage the machine.
 See paragraph »Disconnecting the machine« on page 119.
 Demount the connectors with the proper tools.
 Collect the oil that drips from the cylinders and the hoses.
 Mount new hoses and put them so that they would not get pinched.
 Dispose of the collected oil as required by national legislation.
Operate the hydraulic control valves of the tractor very carefully at first after replacing the hoses as there could still be pockets of air in the pipes! Open and close all the hydraulic control valves a few times before you start working.<|begin_of_text|>

Maintenance
It is necessary to set the dosing plates to the correct positions to each other to ensure correct dosing. If the dosing openings do not close well you will loose unnecessary fertiliser and the application rate will be higher than intended with a specific dosing setting. If the baffles slide far over each other the application rate will be much lower than expected.
If the dosing plates are mounted in the correct positions, you will see a small crack of light when the dosing openings are closed.
 Close the spreader dosing units on the control box. The actuators must be closed properly.
 Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.

Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be 1.0 mm.
If the distance is too great, the fertiliser does not flow through the discharge point opening onto the spreading disc but onto a random point below the discharge bushing. This results in a disrupted spreading pattern.
If the distance is too short, a full hopper may rest partly on the spreading disc, which seriously damages the machine as a result.
 Attach the empty machine and raise it to working height (75 cm).
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Place heavy, stable supports under the ends of the lifting arms.
 Lower the arms onto the supports. Now the machine cannot drop accidentally.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Measure the distance between the spreading disc and the discharge bushing.
