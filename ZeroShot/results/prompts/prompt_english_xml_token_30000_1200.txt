Each has eight by a dosing plate on top of the spreading disc. Both of the dosing</text><text>vanes. They are mounted level so that the fertiliser is spread over the land in a constant horizontal flow. The spreading quantity is regulated plates are located right on top of the discharge bushings. The fertiliser falls on the turning spreading disc. The discharge point is determined by the opening in the discharge bushing behind the vanes. This means that the fertiliser granules are already turning before they come into contact with the vanes on the spreading disc. This prevents granules from breaking apart and becoming powdery. The agitator mounted below in the hopper provides for a constant stream of fertiliser dust, seeds or granules to the dosing opening(s). Moreover, the agitator prevents the chunks of fertiliser from blocking</text><text>one or more dosing openings.</text><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>23</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="24"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>Adjust carefully</text><text>Application rate</text><image /><text>Fine dosing</text><text>Fine application handle Normal dosing setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Normal dosing setting" /><text>Fine application handle Fine application setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Fine application setting" /><text>24</text><text>The spreader has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently of each other. Moreover, it is possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings so that the application rate can also be set precisely with a low flowrate, while the risk of blockages remains limited.</text><text>The machine is equipped with two actuators, which service a dosing plate each, in order to set the application rate. This actuator can open the dosing plate in every required position. In this way, accurate dosing independent of the driving speed is possible. It is also possible to control the dosing setting with external sensors, for example, a nitrogen sensor.</text><text> See paragraph »Application rate« on page 66.</text><text>The actuators are controlled by means of the spreader software. By means of weight sensors, the spreader continuously measures the discharge volumes and corrects it as needed with the application rate. If you want to close on one side, you can choose the function on the control box, after which one of the two dosing plates will be closed immediately.</text><text>Normal dosing</text><text>For precise dosing over a wide range of settings, a spreader with 3 openings is applied per disc.</text><text>Fine application</text><text>The spreader is equipped with a fine spreader as standard equipment to spread low application rates. This fine spreader can be adjusted with a lever per dosing unit.</text><text>Low application rates require a small dosing opening. In order</text><text>· to finely adjust the settings</text><text>· and to counter the blockage</text><text>a transition to the opening, which is open wider, is desirable.</text><text>2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed when using the fine dosing setting.</text><text>The fertiliser now flows through one opening that is opened wider, giving an accurate, reliable flow, also at low application rate.</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="25"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>Width distribution with GEOSPREAD</text><text>Actuator for discharge point adjustment</text><image caption="Actuator for discharge point adjustment" /><text>Combined control with GEOSPREAD system</text><text>Discharge point letter setting</text><image /><text>The spreading pattern is determined by the transverse distribution.</text><text>The discharge point is the place where the fertiliser granules come into touch with the vanes of the spreading disc and substantially determines width distribution.</text><text>Actuators for setting the discharge point</text><text>The GEOSPREAD execution has two additional actuators which set the discharge point. The discharge point setting depends on the fertiliser type and the flowrate in kg/min.</text><text>The letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate is given in the spreading chart. The spreading computer determines the correct setting with the input working and spreading chart data.</text><text>Spreading pattern form</text><text>The spreading pattern is normally a triangle that completely overlaps. A trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate. This spreading pattern has an overlapping area of less than 100%.</text><text>Reducing working width during the pass</text><text>The control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.</text><text>The spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this.</text><text>25</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="26"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>Display of the sections in the main screen</text><image /><image /><text>Shown in the GEOCONTROL screen</text><text>Active sections</text><image caption="Active sections" /><text>INDICATION</text><text>INDICATION</text><text>The active sections are displayed in black triangles in the main screen for both sides:</text><text>· The working width of 24 metres is divided into sections and controlled by the GEOCONTROL.</text><text>The working width reduction per section is displayed in the main screen by leaving out a part of the triangle at a time and displaying the new working width.</text><text>· Here, sections to the left are closed.</text><text>The GEOCONTROL screen also displays the section of activities in a bar below the screen.</text><text>Check the accuracy of the discharge point letter setting by conducting a spreading pattern test (tray test).</text><text> See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.</text><text>Take note of the exact driving distance and make sure there are tramlines.</text><text>If you want to change the application rate or change to another fertiliser type (with similar working width and driving speed), you only have to enter a new flowrate starting value and relevant dosing setting and adapt the discharge point letter setting, if required.</text><text>26</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="27"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>RATE control</text><image /><image /><text>MULTIRATE</text><image /><text>Greenseeker</text><image /><text>RATE control is a variable application rate triggered by an external signal.</text><text>No additional licence key is required.</text><text>.</text><text> See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual</text><text>MULTIRATE can be used on your ISOBUS weighing spreader.</text><text>An additional licence key is required to enable the software module.</text><text>MULTIRATE automatically adjusts the amount of fertiliser per side.

For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.</text><text>The spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.</text><text> See the software instruction manual.</text><text>The working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands.

This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all. A shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.</text><text> See the software instruction manual.</text><text>Use spreading chart</text><text>To determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate, the computer needs at least 1 measuring point. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.</text><text>To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.</text><text>If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.</text><text>31</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="32"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>The ISO tractor</text><text>Tractor with IsoMatch</text><image /><text>Conversion to ISO tractor with IsoMatch power cable set</text><image /><image /><text>32</text><text>ISOBUS tractor connection</text><text>The switching functions and data transfer between the tractor terminal or ISO control box and the machine are operated via the ISOBUS.

This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.</text><text>If you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres.

The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.</text><text>The discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point, of the spreading chart.</text><text>Always check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).</text><text> see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.</text><text>In the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.</text><text>You can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.</text><text>TIP Set the spreader angle before you fill the hopper. It is easier to adjust the top link if the hopper is empty.</text><text>Check the position again after the hopper has been filled!</text><text>If the inclination is at 4 o of 8 o, the spreader area slides further behind the spreader.</text><text> In the machine data screen, increase the length B by 10% or 20% at 4 o or 8 o.</text><text> Please refer to the software instruction manual for the procedure.</text><text>The (online) spreading chart shows the rpm of the spreading discs as well as the rpm of the PTO shaft. The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.</text><text>The PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.

The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.</text><text> See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.</text><text>Look for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:</text><text> Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.</text><text> The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.</text><text> The given values are to be entered in the control system.</text><text>If the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate.

The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period.
