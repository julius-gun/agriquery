All lubricating nipples of the machine can be filled with a universal grease type.
 See »Oil and grease content« on page 124.
 See »Maintenance intervals« on page 125.
The coupling shaft is provided with grease nipples.
 Lubricate the nipples.
 Check the condition of the protection sleeves and the check chains.
 Replace them if damaged.
The discharge bushings are attached lower down to the agitator axle and have 2 grease nipples.
 Open the discharge bushings
 See the software instruction manual.
 Turn the spreading disc by hand until both grease nipples are visible.
