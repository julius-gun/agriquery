Observe the permissible and safe height with regard to
· prescribed maximum height for vehicles in the road traffic regulations,
· high-voltage cables or other cables over the road;
· anticipated maximum headroom.
Pay close attention to these aspects to prevent dangerous situations that could lead to major material damage and possibly to serious physical injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check whether the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (<40km/h) on your tractor, is hidden by the implement.
 Then fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.
 Check the run of the quick coupling ropes of the power lift.<|begin_of_text|>

Preparing the machine to be transported
Driving on the road
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check the run of the quick coupling ropes of the power lift.
 Fit extra lighting and warning signs, if necessary.
 Check all folding parts and their locking devices:
· hopper cover,
· ExactLine
· hydraulic border spreading plate.
 Set all parts of the machine and the tractor, especially the PTO shaft, the hydraulics, the wheels and the electric system, to transport mode.
 Check the weight distribution between front and rear axles.
 Mount front weights, if necessary.
 Check the headroom of the combination.
 Lower the power lift, if necessary.
 Lock the control lever of the power lift while moving so that the machine is not lowered by accident.
 Check if the lights are in good working order.
 Check whether the dosing units are closed.
 Switch off the control box.
 Remove dirt that could fall off while on the road. A dirty road could be hazardous for other drivers.
 Control devices, e.g. ropes, hoses, etc. for remote actuation of devices such as cylinders, shall be guided and positioned in a way they never inadvertently release nor block desired movements/actuations!
 Always ensure adequate lateral securing of a mounted machine in transport position.

Friction between moving parts
Be careful of moving parts making contact with each other while working. You could accidentally touch control levers and cause the machine to move.
Only start working once all machine parts have stopped and the control lever have been secured. Wear safety shoes and gloves and work alone. If something gets jammed it could lead to personal injury.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.<|begin_of_text|>

INDICATION
Use in the field
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist weather conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Before you can make the first pass, you must make adjustments in the field to:
The following is important to ensure that the spreader works properly:
· set it to the correct height from the ground or above the crop and
· by levelling it with the lift rod adjustment and top link.
Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.
 Use the power lift to lift the machine to the correct height.
 Set the spreader horizontally with the lift rod adjustment and the top link.
 Lock the lift limiter in this position.
Height correction with top dressing
If the required height of 75 cm above the crop is not possible with your power lift
 use the high spreading setting of the linkage pins and/or
 set the spreader forward as indicated in the spreading charts.
 See paragraph »Selecting linkage pin height« on page 53.

Last setting check
96
A checklist is given below, as well as in the jacket of the spreading chart.
 Do this last check to ensure good spreading results.
Are you working with the correct settings from the correct spreading chart, based on:
· distribution,
· similar weight,
· type of fertiliser,
· desired working width,
· desired driving speed?
Did you set the spreader in the correct way? Did you:
· set the height over the ground or crops to 75 cm?
· was the correct vane combination mounted?
· are the correct number of dosing openings opened (fine application)?
· is the correct discharge point set?
· is the correct application rate set?
· is the correct GEOPOINT® (centre spreading pattern) set?
· is the coupling shaft fitted to the correct point on the gearbox?
· is the ExactLine or hydraulic border spreading plate in the transport setting (or working position)?
· are the data required entered in the control system?
Did you check the following settings:
Did you:
· have you checked the control system settings?
· perform a tray test to check the spreading pattern?
Work in the correct manner:
· Is the field data selected or input correctly?
· Is the GEOCONTROL application setting correct?
· Have you correctly set the offset?
 See the software instruction manual.
· Did you set the correct PTO shaft rpm?
· Are you driving at the correct driving speed?
· Did you set the tramlines at the correct distance?
· Wind speed too high?
