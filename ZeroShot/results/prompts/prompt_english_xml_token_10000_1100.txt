This could for instance be the distance between the sprayer tramlines.</text><text>In the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system, look for the page that shows the desired working width of the fertiliser type with the most similar properties.</text><text>Various types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.</text><text>If you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres. Enter the actual working width into the control system so that the selected application rate is correctly distributed.</text><text>The working width is adjusted with:</text><text>· the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and</text><text>· the discharge point.</text><text>The working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox.

The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.</text><text>The discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point, of the spreading chart.</text><text>Always check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).</text><text> see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.</text><text>In the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.</text><text>You can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.</text><text>TIP Set the spreader angle before you fill the hopper. It is easier to adjust the top link if the hopper is empty.</text><text>Check the position again after the hopper has been filled!</text><text>If the inclination is at 4 o of 8 o, the spreader area slides further behind the spreader.</text><text> In the machine data screen, increase the length B by 10% or 20% at 4 o or 8 o.</text><text> Please refer to the software instruction manual for the procedure.</text><text>The (online) spreading chart shows the rpm of the spreading discs as well as the rpm of the PTO shaft. The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.</text><text>The PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones. Use the connection point shown in the spreading chart.</text><text>See paragraph »Border spreading« on page 106.</text><text>65</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="66"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Application rate</text><text>Constant application rate</text><image /><image /><image /><text>The control system can drive the spreader in three different ways:</text><text>· distribution that resembles the settings for the preset application rate must be determined under changing circumstances through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,</text><text> see the paragraph below,»Constant application rate«.</text><text>with similar or lower application rates (&lt; 40 kg/min) the fine application kit should be used,</text><text> See paragraph »Fine application« on page 67.</text><text>· with very low application rates on very uneven terrain, preset application rates must be checked manually to ensure that the correct dosing setting is being distributed, without automatic calibration but with driving speed correction,</text><text>· under changing circumstances location specific application rate driven by an external signal, through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,</text><text> See paragraph »Variable, externally driven application rate« on page 72.</text><text>The control system can spread an equal amount of fertiliser over the entire field. In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.</text><text>The control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.</text><text> See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.</text><text>Look for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:</text><text> Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.</text><text> The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.</text><text> The given values are to be entered in the control system.</text><text>If the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate.

With a low application rate and/or a low driving speed the dosing openings are only opened a slight bit so that very little fertiliser would stream through the dosing openings of the spreader. This could easily cause blockage, which would lead to a bad spreading pattern and possible damage the crops.</text><text>We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.</text><text>The flowrate with a specific working width, application rate and driving speed is given in the fourth column of the spreading chart.</text><text>If very low application rates (less than 25 kg/ha) are to be distributed, e.g. only a few kilograms per hectare, the control system cannot perform automatic calibrations. The distributed weight is too small to accurately adjust the application rate.</text><text>Close 2 of the 3 dosing openings to prevent blockages. The remaining opening must be further opened as the application rate with the constant flowrate would be three times as much.</text><text>The handle to close 2 of the 3 fine dosing openings is located at the outside of the spreading disc, above a similar handle for the discharge point. You will find the indications on top of the fine application handle for the number of dosing openings: 3 open holes for standard dosing and 1 open hole and 2 thick holes for fine application.</text><text> Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.</text><text> Pull the hand-grip of the fine application lever out.</text><text> Set the fine application handle until the arrow on the hand-grip indicates the desired position.</text><text> Let go of the hand-grip and check if the fine application handle is locked.</text><text> Set the fine application lever on the other spreading disc in the same way to the same position.</text><text>67</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="68"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Dosing setting</text><image /><image /><image /><image /><image /><text>Setting the spreader</text><text>68</text><text>The dosing setting to be set can be:</text><text>· Read from the relevant spreading chart when you want to spread at a lower application rate using the fine application kit and the symbol of the Fine application kit is indicated in the spreading chart.

With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period.
