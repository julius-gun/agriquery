To begin spreading, proceed as follows:
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Drive the tractor to the first tramline, depending on the driving pattern required, which may be recognised by the marker in place.
 Switch the control box on.
 Check the settings as described in
 Without GEOCONTROL, select and activate a site number in the field registration,
 Switch on the PTO shaft and set the correct spreading disc rpm as reported in the spreading chart.
Do not allow the spreading disc to run for longer than is necessary while the dosing units are closed. This will prevent the agitator from grinding the fertiliser.
 Start driving and open the dosing units at the same time by pressing the start key.
The rpm of the tractor engine (therefore also of the PTO shaft) must remain constant while spreading (with regards to distributing fertiliser along the width).
The driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed!
Based on the offset set in the 'TC Implement Settings' screen, the GEOCONTROL will switch the spreading sections off by itself when passing the headland limit. This happens if the spreading pattern overlaps completely and you run up the headland.
Depending on the set overlap percentage, the connection on the headland and gores will more or less overlap.
The usual setting is 50%.
 See the GEOCONTROL manual.
Even the extent of overlap of the field boundary created can be separately set in the GEOCONTROL manual.
TIP Set the overlap on the field boundary to 0 if you do not wish to spread over the field boundary.<|begin_of_text|>

approaching headland with the GEOCONTROL function switched off:
 Close the dosing units by pressing the stop key before turning to the headland. The PTO shaft can keep running if you intend to start spreading immediately again.
You will find the correct working method and corresponding distances on the headland in
 the next paragraph »Working method on the headland« and paragraph »Spreading on field« from page 97.
 Drive to the next tramline and re-start the spreader at the right time, as displayed in the next paragraph »Working method on the headland«.
In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:
 Stop spreading immediately!
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 See then paragraph »Failure and stoppage« on page 113.
If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.
At low doses <50 kg/ha, it is possible to reduce the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration to minus 15 kg.
 See the software instruction manual.
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

The driving pattern that you use, in other words how you must turn on the headland, depends on your border spreading method.
· spreading the border from the sprayer tramline with ExactLine, one-sided boundary spreading with additional room with the border spreading plate (situation A), or
· border spreading by closing off one disc and using a border spreading plate (situation B).
Do the following when spreading the headland:

Over and underdosing
Results of one-sided over- or underdosing
[Image]
Use in the field
Depending on soil or crop composition, it is preferable to spread more or less fertiliser locally. With the control system, you can over- or under dose to the left, right or on both sides during spreading. You will find all the control keys on the main screen.
 See the software instruction manual.
The spreading pattern of both spreading discs overlap partially, especially in the middle behind the spreader. For this reason, the real application rate will deviate from the one that you set during one-sided over- and under dosing. You will see the effect especially with narrow working widths because that is when the spreading patterns overlap the most.
With small working widths in which you spread in a triangular spreading pattern, the first and second passes of the spreading patterns overlap each other completely.
 See also paragraph »Spreading pattern« on page 28. To distribute an adjusted application rate you must therefore over- or underdose on the first as well as the second pass in the following tramline.

Border spreading
INDICATION
106
Spreading fertiliser up to the border of the property requires concentration. On the one hand you want to achieve maximum cover to the field edge to ensure a good crop, while on the other hand you want to minimise the loss over the field edge.
The spreader has 2 different functions and accessories to cater for border spreading.
· one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate,
· boundary track spreading with ExactLine.
When one-sided boundary spreading, drive with the tractor along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. With boundary track spreading, drive down the first sprayer tramline from the field edge and spray in the direction of the border.
We advise you to spread the site first before you spread the borders. During border spreading, the control system does not perform any automatic calibration, so it cannot accurately determine the correct dosing setting for the required application rate. Consequently, the application rate can deviate from the required application rate during border spreading. By spreading the field first, the control system can determine the correct dosing setting and thus spread at the correct application rate, also during border spreading.<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 107===

One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate
Operation
[Image]
Use in the field
Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules with the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra). The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra).
Direction ( 1 ) (environmental set- ting)
Spread less to the field edge.
This will decrease the loss over the field edge, but the cover will not be as good
Direction ( 9 ) (yield setting)
Spread more to the field edge.
Cover is better, but the loss is greater
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test if the border spreading plate (optional extra) door de test therefore always before hand as described in

Procedure with hydraulic border spreading plate
[Image]
[Image]

Left and right border spreading is possible with the hydraulic border spreading plate.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Lower the border plate.
 Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!
 Adjust the spreader based on the details given in the spreading chart for the desired working width. Use the same settings and coupling shaft mounting point as with full field spreading,
 See also paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Start the tractor again.
 Switch the control box on.
 Engage the PTO shaft. The correct rpm of the spreading discs is the value of the relevant spreading chart.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
The control system will drive the dosing units in such a way that the actual application rate is equal to the set application rate through the lower PTO shaft RPM.
In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:
 Stop spreading immediately!
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 See then paragraph »Failure and stoppage« on page 113.
After border spreading:
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Close the dosing.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 109===

Driving pattern
Use in the field
Two different driving patterns can be used, depending on the situation on your land.
Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic border spreading plate, but disconnect the right spreading disc and close the dosing unit,
 see the methods above.
 Increase the PTO shaft rpm to 100% again.
 Drive down the second path in the first sprayer tramline.
 After the second operation, link up the right spreading disc drive again.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic spreading plate.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
 Drive up the second line 1 working width from the field edge (X metres). Maintain the distance with the field edge carefully by using pickets, for instance.

INDICATION
[Image]
[Image]
Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) (=first sprayer tramline) when doing boundary track spreading with the ExactLine (accessory). The flow of fertiliser granules, seeds or other granules spread with ExactLine. The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the ExactLine position.
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test the ExactLine therefore always in advance as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The (online) spreading charts indicate the correct setting for the ExactLine and the relevant rpm for the PTO shaft and the spreading discs.
If the settings of the ExactLine are not given in the relevant spreading chart they can be obtained in the following sources:
· find with the online spreading chart service on the website or via the Free Application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
 See paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
Always check the settings of the ExactLine by performing the test as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The type of fertiliser is determined when adjusting the spreader, as described in
 paragraph »Determine the type and pattern of the granules« on page 57.
you can choose from 3 settings from the chart:
· YIELD.
· ECO,
In the yield setting (YIELD), the loss over the field edge is higher than what is allowed by the environmental standard. Therefore, never use this setting next to surface water. Cover to the border is very good with this option.
The loss over the field edge will be equal to or less than the environment standard in the environment setting (ECO). Always use this setting when working next to a surface water! The result is that the cover at the border of the property is not optimum.

Use in the field
 Engage the ExactLine by letting the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve run for a few seconds. This is also how pressure is built in the accumulator. You will see the ExactLine symbol on the main screen. The symbol only appears when the ExactLine is in working position.
 Close the tap on the hydraulic hose to prevent the ExactLine from changing position while spreading due to a leaking tractor valve.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Do not change the settings of the spreader.
 See paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Set the ExactLine to the required position, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart.
 Start the tractor and set the correct PTO shaft and spreading discs RPM, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart or the chart on the previous page.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
 Continue operating the spreader in the same way as in full field spreading,
 See paragraph »Start spreading« on page 100.
 Check regularly while spreading to see if the symbol of the ExactLine remains on screen. If the symbol disappears the ExactLine is no longer in a good working position.
 Set the ExactLine back to transport mode after use by opening the tap in the hydraulic hose and then opening the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve for a few seconds.
The ExactLine's position is displayed on the main screen if you have connected this function.
 See the software instruction manual.
In this way, you will make fewer spreading errors caused by an incorrectly positioned ExactLine.

Causes
Use in the field
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
While working with the spreader, you might come into contact with fertiliser or other substances that you want to spread. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
During spreading, if you:
· see that a spreading disc is spreading irregularly or not at all while the dosing units are open,
· hear a loud noise,
· become aware that the machine is vibrating seriously,
· an alarm is shown on the main screen indicating that the PTO shaft is not connected, while it actually is connected,
· an alarm will appear on the main screen, indicating that the dosing units cannot be closed,
 see the software instruction manual.
Stop spreading immediately! Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!

INDICATION
These failures are probably caused by one of the following:
· a hard object blocks the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking the supply from flowing to the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking fertiliser from flowing through the dosing opening or discharge bushing,
· crushed and/or damp fertiliser forms an encrusted layer beneath the agitator and blocks the flow through the dosing openings,
· a lump of damp fertiliser has formed in the discharge bushing and is blocking flow from the discharge bushing opening. This happens especially when the spreader has not been thoroughly cleaned after it was last used.
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Handle with care
Cautiously approach the machine and handle with care. There could be hot or live parts! Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
To find the cause of the failure or stoppage and solve it as far as possible, proceed as follows.
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 Switch off the electronic control system.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the handbrake of the tractor.
Do not place the machine on the ground. Placing a filled machine on the ground damages the structure!<|begin_of_text|>

Use in the field
 Examine the spreading discs and the discharge opening to see what the cause of the failure/stoppage is.
 Adapt the discharge point as needed for easier access.
 If you still cannot see the cause, carefully remove the vanes to see better into the discharge opening of the discharge bushing.
 Pass an object such as a screwdriver through the discharge opening and carefully feel if you can find an object in or damage to the dosing openings or agitator.
If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The agitator is probably damaged too. You must first repair the damage or have it repaired before continuing with spreading.
 Place an object, for example a cloth or bag, in the discharge opening of the discharge bushing on the damaged side.. This will prevent you from wasting fertiliser during transport.
 Start the tractor and engage the control box. The dosing units will now close.
 Switch off the control box.
 Take all appropriate measures for road transport.
 See paragraph »Preparing the machine to be transported« on page 93.
On the site of a lockable storage depot:
 Empty the hopper without positioning the machine on the ground.
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
Lock the sieve in the open position
If you open the sieves, you should lock them to prevent unwanted closing. Accidental closure could lead to serious injury.
 Remove the object that caused the damage.

If you have not found any damage, the failure is probably due to stoppage from an encrusted layer of fertiliser.
 Try to reduce the size of the lump or encrusted layer with an object such as a stick, screwdriver or vane.
If you open the filters to reduce the lump or encrusted layer from the top side, you should block them to prevent unwanted closing.
If you can reduce the lump or encrusted layer in this way:
 Inspect the hopper contents for other lumps and reduce them.
 Fit the vanes and secure them with the lock nut.
 Check the discharge point setting.
 Close the hopper cover.
 Continue spreading.
If you have not managed to reduce the lump or encrusted layer because it is out of reach or there is no tool at your disposal:
 Close the hopper cover.
 Follow the working method as described in the previous paragraph »Damage« until emptying the hopper.
 Remove or reduce the lump or encrusted layer.
 If necessary, dry the hopper and the dosing mechanism.
Opening the sieve clip
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
 Lock the sieve to prevent it from closing accidentally.
 Close the sieves and check the lock.

Storing the machine
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
It is easy to come into contact with the materials when putting away the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protect the machine
Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan. After cleaning, inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with the supplied preserving liquid point for protection against corrosion of the
machine, read the instructions before use.
Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners
You can clean the machine with water or steam, possibly using only suitable cleaning tools. Also read here and adhere to the safety instructions of the material manufacturer.
 Only use low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.
 Keep the nozzle more than 30 cm clear of turning parts, sensors, parts of the electric system, hydraulic hoses, stickers and plastic parts.
 Only spray perpendicular to sticker edges.
Waste storage and disposal
The waste water from cleaning the machine is contaminated with fertiliser and possibly also with lubrications. Collect the waste and dispose of it in terms of national regulations.

It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.
The advantages of this working order are:
· additional checks on the machine right after work,
· ensuring the longevity of the machine,
· less delays due to problems while working with the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples.
 See paragraph »Lubricating points« on page 126.
 Clean the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples once again.
When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.

Storing the machine
Disconnect safely
You may only disconnect the machine when
· all parts are in a safe condition,
· your immediate vicinity is safe,
· the hopper is empty.
Work carefully:
· check the environment (children!) and ensure that nobody is in the vicinity of the tractor or the machine,
· wear safety gloves and shoes,
· the machine or parking support must only be placed on a straight, firm surface,
· never stand between the tractor and machine while the power lift is operated externally while disconnecting the machine. Using the power lift entails the risk of accidents by crushing or jack-knifing,
· operate the power lift slowly and carefully,
· the power lift during disconnection must be placed in such a position that accidental release or lowering would be eliminated,
· sufficient distance must be maintained between parts (e.g. parking support) that rest on the ground.
Working unsafely could cause serious injuries.
Proceed as follows to store the machine in stable condition for a shorter or longer period.
 Switch off the pto shaft.
 Check that the ExactLine hydraulic hose tap is closed.
 Check that the ExactLine hydraulic hose tap of the hydraulic border spreading plate is closed.
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system.
 Place the machine on a stable, level base.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Adjust the length of the top link in such a way that it is no longer live.
 Release the top link by undoing the release rope from the catch hooks and pulling the top link up.
 Release the lower links by undoing the release ropes from the catch hooks and lowering the power lift as far as possible.

Maintenance
Do not modify the machine
Do not modify the machine in any way. Unauthorised modifications may impair the function and/or safety and affect the life of the machine.
Only use original parts when replacing
Using other non-genuine parts could lead to problems and unsafe situations when using the machine.
Accessories and parts must be correctly mounted
Assemble accessories and parts according to specifications and attach them only for their designated purpose; ensure that it is locked correctly. Accessories and parts which are not fastened securely could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.
Tighten all bolts and nuts
Check that all the nuts and bolts are well set. Check this again after one hour of use
· after delivery and
· after maintenance or repairs have been carried out.
Avoid jamming under the sieves
There is a risk that parts of your body may get jammed in the hopper during maintenance activities or when closing the sieves. Secure the sieve in an open position and unlock the sieves on the outside. Jamming could cause injury.
Avoid contact with materials
You should only come into contact with the materials when cleaning the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Explosion danger because of nitrate
Fertiliser that contains nitrate can create an explosion danger if it should come into contact with fire. All fertiliser remnants should therefore be removed from voids, corners, tubes and tubing before welding, cutting or grinding on the machine. An explosion will cause damage to the machine and could lead to personal injury.
Adhere to all the safety precautions as described in  paragraph »Safety requirements« from page 10.

gearboxes of the spreading discs
There is grease in the gearbox below the spreading discs. The level of the grease under the filler opening must be 35 mm when the machine has been standing still for a short time.
[Image]
 Remove dirt, fertiliser or grease from the gearbox.
 Open the gearbox by removing the cap from the filler opening.
 Measure the level of the grease.
 Add grease until the desired level is reached.
 Close the filler opening.
ply grease to the contact surfaces of both of the profiled tubes should you note during coupling or decoupling that the halves of the coupling shaft are not sliding in and out smoothly. This should at any rate be done at least once per season.
 Detach the coupling shaft on the one side.
 Pull the shaft halves away from each another.
 Grease the running surface of the inner profiled tube.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Attach the coupling shaft.
 Hook the check chains to the tractor side.
The central gearbox consists of 2 compartments filled with gear wheel grease EP 00/000. The grease in principle never needs to be replaced.
Each compartment holds 0.25 litre.
 Check the level regularly.
 Remove dirt, fertiliser or grease from the gearbox.
 Remove the cap from the dipstick and filler opening.
 Fill the gear box with new grease until it almost comes out of the opening.
Replace the cap.

Maintenance
Add oil
Connectors
The following parts only function well if they are provided with sufficient oil. Check this regularly.
The connectors between the central gearbox and the spreading disc gearboxes are used with border spreading and when checking the spreading pattern with the tray test. Disconnect one of the connectors from the spreading discs.
 Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding and becoming
difficult to use.
