After starting up, the screen with the last (two) selected applications appears.
Compact and complete
IsoMatch Go, as a handy and more compact variant of the doublescreen version, offers complete ISO control with all functions. Besides the smaller dimension with the single screen, the number of USB connections and the absence of Wlan/Wifi constitutes the biggest difference.
Many additional functions.
The latest developments in ISOBUS communication between tractor and implement and ease-of-use are all incorporated into the IsoMatch Tellus GO.
Connect the ISOBUS tractor via IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable
If your tractor is provided with a full ISOBUS connection, a connection with the 9-pins in Cab cable between your tractor and the IsoMatch Tellus GO control box is sufficient.
Other connections are made via the "Input IM Tellus" cable, supplied as a standard item.
Quick menu navigation with the scroll wheel and additional keys

Getting familiar with the machine
The IsoMatch Grip accessory is a control unit on which most of the implement functions used can be operated centrally with one handle. This is available in addition to the ISOBUS terminal such as the IsoMatch.
Handle control

44 functions under 11 buttons
The IsoMatch Grip has 11 function buttons and one selector that are operated with the thumb and under which there are 44 functions.
