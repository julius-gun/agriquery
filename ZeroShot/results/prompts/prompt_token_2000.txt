The loading volume of the spreader can be increased by putting one, two or three hopper extensions in place.
 See paragraph »Technical specifications« on page 36.
Keep the increase in the filling height and the weight of the machine into account.
 See paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines« on page 13.
The hopper cover protects the fertiliser in the hopper against humidity and dirt.
The sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening.
The electric hopper cover protects the fertiliser in the hopper against humidity and dirt.
The cover can be opened and closed electrically for a large fill opening.
 See paragraph »Electric hopper cover« on page 42.
This sieve can be used when spreading with pellets.<|begin_of_text|>
