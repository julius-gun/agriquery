They are mounted level so that the fertiliser is spread over the land in a constant horizontal flow. The spreading quantity is regulated plates are located right on top of the discharge bushings. The fertiliser falls on the turning spreading disc. The discharge point is determined by the opening in the discharge bushing behind the vanes. This means that the fertiliser granules are already turning before they come into contact with the vanes on the spreading disc. This prevents granules from breaking apart and becoming powdery. The agitator mounted below in the hopper provides for a constant stream of fertiliser dust, seeds or granules to the dosing opening(s). Moreover, the agitator prevents the chunks of fertiliser from blocking</text><text>one or more dosing openings.</text><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>23</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="24"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>Adjust carefully</text><text>Application rate</text><image /><text>Fine dosing</text><text>Fine application handle Normal dosing setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Normal dosing setting" /><text>Fine application handle Fine application setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Fine application setting" /><text>24</text><text>The spreader has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently of each other. Moreover, it is possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings so that the application rate can also be set precisely with a low flowrate, while the risk of blockages remains limited.</text><text>The machine is equipped with two actuators, which service a dosing plate each, in order to set the application rate. This actuator can open the dosing plate in every required position. In this way, accurate dosing independent of the driving speed is possible. It is also possible to control the dosing setting with external sensors, for example, a nitrogen sensor.</text><text> See paragraph »Application rate« on page 66.</text><text>The actuators are controlled by means of the spreader software. By means of weight sensors, the spreader continuously measures the discharge volumes and corrects it as needed with the application rate.

This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.</text><text>To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.</text><text>If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration.

The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.</text><text>The PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones. Use the connection point shown in the spreading chart.</text><text>See paragraph »Border spreading« on page 106.</text><text>65</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="66"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Application rate</text><text>Constant application rate</text><image /><image /><image /><text>The control system can drive the spreader in three different ways:</text><text>· distribution that resembles the settings for the preset application rate must be determined under changing circumstances through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,</text><text> see the paragraph below,»Constant application rate«.</text><text>with similar or lower application rates (&lt; 40 kg/min) the fine application kit should be used,</text><text> See paragraph »Fine application« on page 67.</text><text>· with very low application rates on very uneven terrain, preset application rates must be checked manually to ensure that the correct dosing setting is being distributed, without automatic calibration but with driving speed correction,</text><text>· under changing circumstances location specific application rate driven by an external signal, through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,</text><text> See paragraph »Variable, externally driven application rate« on page 72.</text><text>The control system can spread an equal amount of fertiliser over the entire field. In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.</text><text>The control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.</text><text> See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.</text><text>Look for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:</text><text> Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.</text><text> The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.</text><text> The given values are to be entered in the control system.</text><text>If the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate.

With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.</text><text>75</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="76"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Spreading pattern check (tray test)</text><text>76</text><text>Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material</text><text>You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader.
