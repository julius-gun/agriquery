Stop the engine and remove the keys from the ignition
Switch the engine off as soon as you leave the tractor. Remove the key from the ignition to prevent the tractor from being started unintentionally while you are in the danger zone. This especially applies when changing the settings or while maintenance and repairs are carried out.
Keep clear from a running machine
Fertiliser is spread over a great distance during operation. Ensure that nobody comes within working reach of the machine during operation. Do not come into the working area before all parts of the machine are standing still.
The power lift must only be operated outside of the danger zone
In the area between the tractor and the machine, there is a danger of being pinned down by the power lift. The power lift must therefore only be engaged from beyond the danger zone. Secure the tractor with the parking brake and wheel chocks to ensure it would not roll away.
Do not approach the machine until it has come to a complete standstill
The rotating parts of the machine never come to an immediate halt, they always wind down. The moving parts of a machine are not always visible. Do not approach the machine until all moving parts have come to a complete halt.
Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured machine
The machine or parts of the machine could accidentally fall due to waning pressure, for instance. Always place the machine on proper supports if you have to work under the machine!<|begin_of_text|>

Only lift the machine at the lifting points
If a machine is being elevated, only attach it to the indicated lifting points. Never go underneath an elevated machine. Allow for any possible movements of the elevated machine, whether wanted or not.
Be careful of getting jammed or pinched
If the machine is engaged or operated unintentionally you could get struck in moving parts, which could lead to injury. Be extra alert when working in the vicinity of moving parts. Always keep in mind that the motor or parts of the machine could still be retaining some energy.
Read the user's manual
The instruction manual contains procedures for working correctly to ensure safe work, as well as dangers one could possibly encounter. Keep to these procedures as described and give due consideration to the safety measures in place!
Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars
Prevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working with higher pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.
Motor vehicles with limited speed (<40 km/h), agricultural and forestry tractors and their trailers, as well as other vehicles, must be provided with an orange triangle with a red reflector at the rear in the form of a truncated triangle.

To be used and operated by 1 person
The machine may only be operated by one person, from the tractor. Operating the machine from the tractor will keep you out of harm's way. Other people should not be in the immediate vicinity of the machine and the tractor. Those who are within the working area and the danger zone could be injured.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
Check the state of the tractor and machine
Only work with the tractor and machine if they are in good condition Always check that:
· all lighting, safety and warning provisions must be mounted correctly and be in good working condition,
· the lifting and pulling capabilities must be sufficient,
 see paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines« on page 13,
· the tractor must be suitable for the machine, such as in the area of stability, engine capability, axle load and total weight,
· it is sufficient for the working with the machine and for transport.
Adhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or machine damage.
 See the tractor's technical details.<|begin_of_text|>

Put a fire extinguisher in place
Carry a fire extinguisher at all times, especially when operating in dry crop materials. This should be a multi-purpose ABC rated extinguisher with a 5 kg capacity, approved by the appropriate authority. Mount this on the tractor and/or on the machine. Fire could damage the machine and cause injury.
Use active carbon filters
Harmful gasses and mists could enter the air duct of the tractor while it is in use. An active carbon filter should therefore be mounted in the air ventilation of the tractor. Harmful materials could cause serious personal injury.
Ensure the tractor is safe when leaving it
Never leave the tractor without:
· switching off the PTO shaft,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the tractor engine,
· the key must be removed from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
Leaving the tractor unsafe could create dangerous situations that could lead to injury.
Responding to problems
In the event of operational problems you should:
· stop immediately,
· switch the tractor and machine off,
· attend to the problem or call in the assistance of an expert.
Never use the tractor in a closed area
The tractor must never be used in a closed area. Exhaust fumes collect without being noticed. Exhaust fumes can cause serious or deadly injuries.
The following is of importance with the loading machine to ensure safe operation:
· the maximum load of the machine,
· the maximum axle load of the tractor,
· weight distribution over the axles,
· and the carry load per wheel.
At least 20% own weight from the tractor must rest on the front axle and 45% on the rear axle in order to maintain good manoeuvrability. Check if these conditions are adhered to before purchasing a machine! Adhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or tractor and machine damage.

Use the correct coupling shaft
Only use coupling shafts complying with the manufacturer's specification for that specific use! In order to ensure protection of both man and machine exercise extreme caution when working at a coupling shaft other then described in this manual and/or on the instruction at the coupling shaft.
Modifications to and other special activities at coupling shafts are only permitted with the explicit written instruction and approval of the manufacturers of both the machine and the coupling shaft! Use the correct tools and original parts to ensure a good performance and maximum safety. The use of an incorrect coupling shaft can cause damage to the machine.
Mount the appropriate protection
Externally accessible coupling shafts, the tractor's PTO shafts and machine input-axle must be equipped with appropriate guards and tubes. Working without guarding can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Replace protective coupling shaft tubes when required
Replace the coupling shaft protection sleeves at the first signs of wear. Protection sleeves can wear without being noticed. Worn or damaged protection sleeves can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protect the PTO shaft end well
Slide the protection sleeve over the PTO shaft as soon as the coupling shaft has been removed. Clothing could become entangled into an unprotected PTO shaft end that could lead to serious injury.
Hydraulic oil is under high pressure
Never try to stop a leak with your fingers. Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!
Disconnect the control box
Disconnect the control box from the electric system as soon as no more functions are needed in order to prevent unintentional operation. Keeping the control box connect can be dangerous and can damage the machine
as well as cause bodily injury.
Battery cables must be connected properly
Always disconnect the battery cable (negative pole) from the electric system when working on the machine. Connect the battery cables correctly: Positive pole first, followed by the negative pole. Always equip the positive pole with the appropriate protective cap to avoid a short circuit as this could lead to damage to the tractor and machine.<|begin_of_text|>

Safety
[Image]
Only use after training
The machine may not be operated before the user has been properly instructed by the dealer or an authorised representative of the manufacturer.
Ensure that you are familiar with all systems and control machines and their functions prior to working with them! It will be too late for that once you are working! Careless usage could lead to injury and damage to the machine.
To be used and operated by 1 person
The machine may only be operated by one person, from the tractor. Operating the machine from the tractor will keep you out of harm's way. Other people should not be in the immediate vicinity of the machine and the tractor. Those who are within the working area and the danger zone could be injured.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Do not stand on the machine
Being on the machine during activities and transport is prohibited. You may only be on the parts of the machine intended for the purpose if it is standing still and prevented from rolling. Being on the machine while in any other state could lead to serious injury.
Keep the protection intact
The protection of the machine, e.g. shields and guards, protects from penetrating into danger areas! Therefore all protection must be kept in optimal condition and moved into the right position prior to starting to work! The absence of protective gear could lead to injury.

Check the decoupling ropes of the quick coupling
The decoupling ropes must never be tense and must provide sufficient freedom for movement, even with the power lift in the lowest position as it could otherwise accidentally disconnect the quick coupling.
Drive carefully
Moving behaviour, manoeuvrability and braking performance are influenced by a trailed machine. When taking turns, pay attention to the extended width/length (turning circle) and/or large mass (sluggishness) of the machine. Ensure sufficient braking effect and safe manageability! Careless driving could lead to serious injury and damage to the machine.
Adjust the driving speed
High driving speeds and uneven surfaces on the road or field can put considerable strain on the machine and cause the tractor or machine to be overstrained, which could lead to damage. Always adjust the driving speed to the conditions of the environment and the terrain! When driving up and down hills and across slopes, do not make any sudden turns!
Do not leave the driving cabin
Never leave the operator's seat during operation or transport. The driver can be in the danger zone of the tractor or the machine and could not have a proper view of the immediate vicinity. This could lead to injury to the driver or third parties.
Do not allow the machine to tilt
When driving up and down hills and across slopes, do not make any sudden turns! Do not drive transverse on a slope with a steep angle. Tilting can cause serious machine damage.
Blockade of a security device
In case of blockade or operation of a security device, never work on the machine without:
· switching off the PTO shaft,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the tractor engine,
· the key must be removed from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.<|begin_of_text|>

Always keep to the prescribed maintenance intervals
Take the machine for inspection and maintenance at the intervals as prescribed in this manual. All of the manufacturer's responsibility and the guarantee will become null and void if the prescribed intervals are not adhered to.
Performed by an authorised person
Always have an authorised expert perform maintenance and repairs as prescribed in, as prescribed in
 paragraph »Authorisation« on page 11.
Maintenance performed in an inexpert manner could lead to unsafe work situations or damage to the machine or crops.
Never use the tractor in a closed area
The tractor must never be used in a closed area. Exhaust fumes collect without being noticed. Exhaust fumes can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protect the machine
Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan.

Avoid contact with materials
You should only come into contact with the materials when cleaning the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Explosion danger because of nitrate
Fertilisers hat contain nitrate can create an explosion danger if they come into contact with fire. All fertiliser remnants should therefore be removed from voids, corners, tubes and tubing before welding, cutting or grinding on the machine. Explosions could cause damage to the machine and lead to personal injury.
Prevent unintentional operation
Render all parts that could contain residual energy safe, as well as all parts that conduct energy such as compressed air, hydraulics and electricity. Release all pressure from the system and disconnect the pipes and cables. Unintended operation could lead to injury.<|begin_of_text|>

This rotary type spreader has two spreading discs. Each has eight by a dosing plate on top of the spreading disc. Both of the dosing
vanes. They are mounted level so that the fertiliser is spread over the land in a constant horizontal flow. The spreading quantity is regulated plates are located right on top of the discharge bushings. The fertiliser falls on the turning spreading disc. The discharge point is determined by the opening in the discharge bushing behind the vanes. This means that the fertiliser granules are already turning before they come into contact with the vanes on the spreading disc. This prevents granules from breaking apart and becoming powdery. The agitator mounted below in the hopper provides for a constant stream of fertiliser dust, seeds or granules to the dosing opening(s). Moreover, the agitator prevents the chunks of fertiliser from blocking
one or more dosing openings.

The spreader has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently of each other. Moreover, it is possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings so that the application rate can also be set precisely with a low flowrate, while the risk of blockages remains limited.
The machine is equipped with two actuators, which service a dosing plate each, in order to set the application rate. This actuator can open the dosing plate in every required position. In this way, accurate dosing independent of the driving speed is possible. It is also possible to control the dosing setting with external sensors, for example, a nitrogen sensor.
 See paragraph »Application rate« on page 66.
The actuators are controlled by means of the spreader software. By means of weight sensors, the spreader continuously measures the discharge volumes and corrects it as needed with the application rate. If you want to close on one side, you can choose the function on the control box, after which one of the two dosing plates will be closed immediately.
Normal dosing
For precise dosing over a wide range of settings, a spreader with 3 openings is applied per disc.
Fine application
The spreader is equipped with a fine spreader as standard equipment to spread low application rates. This fine spreader can be adjusted with a lever per dosing unit.
Low application rates require a small dosing opening. In order
· to finely adjust the settings
· and to counter the blockage
a transition to the opening, which is open wider, is desirable.
2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed when using the fine dosing setting.
The fertiliser now flows through one opening that is opened wider, giving an accurate, reliable flow, also at low application rate.<|begin_of_text|>

Combined control with GEOSPREAD system
Discharge point letter setting
[Image]
The spreading pattern is determined by the transverse distribution.
The discharge point is the place where the fertiliser granules come into touch with the vanes of the spreading disc and substantially determines width distribution.
Actuators for setting the discharge point
The GEOSPREAD execution has two additional actuators which set the discharge point. The discharge point setting depends on the fertiliser type and the flowrate in kg/min.
The letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate is given in the spreading chart. The spreading computer determines the correct setting with the input working and spreading chart data.
Spreading pattern form
The spreading pattern is normally a triangle that completely overlaps. A trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate. This spreading pattern has an overlapping area of less than 100%.
Reducing working width during the pass
The control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.
The spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this.

If you want to change the application rate or change to another fertiliser type (with similar working width and driving speed), you only have to enter a new flowrate starting value and relevant dosing setting and adapt the discharge point letter setting, if required.

RATE control is a variable application rate triggered by an external signal.
No additional licence key is required.
.
 See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual
MULTIRATE can be used on your ISOBUS weighing spreader.
An additional licence key is required to enable the software module.
MULTIRATE automatically adjusts the amount of fertiliser per side. The application rate to the left and right is independently based on a rate map.
You can do this on the basis of a maximum of 8 measuring points of the rate map.
This is a combined functionality between the spreader and the terminal, providing the option of using two or more variable quantities in the working width of the spreader.
A total of 8 VRA sections are supported by the spreader.
To achieve full functionality with the IsoMatch PRO Terminal, you also need the IsoMatch GEOCONTROL licence key.
When MULTIRATE signals are received, the following icon is visible.
 See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual
The ISOBUS supports the Farmfacts Greeseeker sensor. From Greenseeker version 06.00.00.0257 onwards, the software supports the reception of the external signal. Section control continues working through the Task Controller.

Spreading pattern
Full field spreading pattern
Optimum distribution of the fertiliser with minimum impact on the environment can be achieved through the settings and tools described.
The full field spreading pattern overlaps 100%
A triangular spreading pattern that completely overlaps can be expected with most fertiliser types with an average working width.

Influence of the GEOSPREAD function
One-sided boundary spreading with border spreading plate
You can drive along the field edge with a half spreading pattern filled to 100% with the border spreading plate and one closed dosing unit. You have to optimise the spreading pattern and thereby overcome environmental pollution when adjusting the border spreading plate.
[Image]
With the hydraulic border spreading plate, one-sided boundary spreading is also possible at the left.

A trapezium-shaped spreading pattern will gradually be converted to a triangular spreading pattern with complete overlap by reducing the working width on sloping passes.<|begin_of_text|>

Boundary track spreading with ExactLine
It is possible to spread right up to the border (boundary track spreading) from the first sprayer tramline with ExactLine.
A ExactLine is available for the right and the left.
Selecting the pattern for border spreading
It is not possible to completely cover the field border at the application rate and not have anything go beyond the border. Current environmental standards only allow for minimal loss over the field edge.
ExactLine
ExactLine bends the fertiliser granules in such a way that loss over the edge of the border is restricted to the bare minimum and it provides as full a spreading pattern as possible.
ExactLine has 'environment' and 'yield' settings for precisely adjusting border spreading.

The ISO control system
The automatic weighing system
The ISO control system uses the ISOBUS communication protocol, which makes it suitable for tractors that are also equipped with an ISOBUS communication system. For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.
The spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.
 See the software instruction manual.
The working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands. Field data imported from a new management system or a newly created field boundary is used for this purpose.

flowrate (kg/min)

INDICATION
Dosing setting
Getting familiar with the machine
The computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate with the following formula:
Flowrate required = (kg/min)
Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)
600
Automatic Calibration test
With the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute, the computer determines what dosing setting corresponds with what flowrate. This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all. A shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.
 See the software instruction manual.
Use spreading chart
To determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate, the computer needs at least 1 measuring point. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.
To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.
If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.
