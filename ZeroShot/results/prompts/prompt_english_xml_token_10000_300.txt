With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.</text><text>101</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="102"><text>Use in the field</text><text>Working method on the headland</text><text>102</text><text>The driving pattern that you use, in other words how you must turn on the headland, depends on your border spreading method.</text><text>· spreading the border from the sprayer tramline with ExactLine, one-sided boundary spreading with additional room with the border spreading plate (situation A), or</text><text>· border spreading by closing off one disc and using a border spreading plate (situation B).</text><text>Do the following when spreading the headland:</text><text>For boundary track spreading from the sprayer tramline (ExactLine and situation A)</text><image /><text>GEOCONTROL headland function ExactLine</text><text> Begin with creating the field boundary where you spread on edges with the ExactLine while driving to the left through the first sprayer tramline.</text><text> Make a second round with the ExactLine switched off for a double headland, if required.</text><text> Fill the field with injections on your sprayer tramline defined previously.</text><text>The GEOCONTROL will itself determine the correct start/stop moment while approaching and turning from the spread headland.</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="103"><text>Use in the field</text><text>Hydraulic border spreading plate</text><text> Set the field boundary as close as possible along the field boundary while driving to the left or to the right, to spread right down to the border with the border spreading plate.</text><text> Fill the headland through to half the working width without the border spreading plate with the right/left dosing closed to make an additional pass.</text><text> See »One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate« on page 107.</text><text> Fill the field with injections on your sprayer tramline defined previously.</text><text>The GEOCONTROL will itself determine the correct start/stop moment while approaching and turning from the spread headland.</text><text>Spreading without GEOCONTROL headland:</text><text> Stop spreading by closing the dosing units of the machine when you are half a working width from the end of the land.</text><text> Let the spreading discs turns and do not switch off the PTO shaft.</text><text> Open the dosing units again at one and a half the working width of the field edge.</text><text> Finally spread the field edges with the ExactLine.</text><text> See paragraph »Border spreading« on page 106.</text><text>With one-sided border spreading (situation B)</text><image /><text>103</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="104"><text>Use in the field</text><text>GEOCONTROL headland function</text><text>104</text><text> Begin with creating the field boundary where you spread down to the border along the field boundary while driving to the left/right with the border spreading plate and the right/left dosing switched off.</text><text> Fill the field with injections on your sprayer tramline defined previously.</text><text>The GEOCONTROL will interrupt and start the process at the correct time while turning on the headland.</text><text>Without GEOCONTROL</text><text> Drive as closely as possible to the end of the property and stop spreading by closing the dosing units before you turn.</text><text> Let the spreading discs turns and do not switch off the PTO shaft.</text><text> Open the dosing units again when you are a full working width down from the end of the land.</text><text> Finally spread the field edges with the border spreading plate.</text><text> See paragraph »Border spreading« on page 106.</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="105"><text>Over and underdosing</text><text>Results of one-sided over- or underdosing</text><image /><text>Use in the field</text><text>Depending on soil or crop composition, it is preferable to spread more or less fertiliser locally.
