The fertiliser falls on the turning spreading disc. The discharge point is determined by the opening in the discharge bushing behind the vanes. This means that the fertiliser granules are already turning before they come into contact with the vanes on the spreading disc. This prevents granules from breaking apart and becoming powdery. The agitator mounted below in the hopper provides for a constant stream of fertiliser dust, seeds or granules to the dosing opening(s). Moreover, the agitator prevents the chunks of fertiliser from blocking</text><text>one or more dosing openings.</text><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>23</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="24"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>Adjust carefully</text><text>Application rate</text><image /><text>Fine dosing</text><text>Fine application handle Normal dosing setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Normal dosing setting" /><text>Fine application handle Fine application setting</text><image caption="Fine application handle Fine application setting" /><text>24</text><text>The spreader has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently of each other.

This actuator can open the dosing plate in every required position. In this way, accurate dosing independent of the driving speed is possible. It is also possible to control the dosing setting with external sensors, for example, a nitrogen sensor.</text><text> See paragraph »Application rate« on page 66.</text><text>The actuators are controlled by means of the spreader software.

This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.</text><text>To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.</text><text>If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration.

You must enter the characteristics of the fertiliser, your working width, application rate, driving speed and the type of fertiliser. You will then receive advice from the website for setting your spreader: dosing setting, discharge point, flowrate, vane combination and angle of the spreader.</text><text>Methods for adjusting the spreader can be found at:  chapter »Setting the spreader« on page 62.</text><text>Also check the advice given on the online spreading chart service. Do a calibration test to check the dosing setting. Then check the spreading pattern with a tray test.</text><text> See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.</text><text>You can reach the spreading chart service as follows:</text><text> Go to the website of the Kverneland Group: http://www.Kvernelandspreadingcharts.com.</text><text> The various languages are given at the top of the page.</text><text> Start the spreading chart service and complete the details required.</text><text> The spreading chart service will then request that you select a product with comparable characteristics.</text><text> The spreading chart service will then indicate the settings for your spreader. Follow the working methods as described in</text><text> paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.</text><text>AutosetApp gives you the option to download these spreading charts to the IsoMatch Tellus terminal in order to set the spreader automatically. After choosing the desired fertiliser type, the working width, application rate, driving speed, dosing and discharge opening are transmitted to the spreader using the AutosetApp. The spreader then automatically gets the correct setting. Automatic adjustment of the discharge point only applies to GEOSPREAD spreaders. The same data may be transmitted to the spreader via the AutosetApp for the other weighing spreader models such as Exacta-CL EW and Exacta-TL(X). Except for the discharge opening, the spreader then has to be set manually.</text><text>Using the Kverneland Group spreading charts application, you can easily find the right settings for your spreader.</text><text>The spreading charts application gives you immediate access to the most up-to-date test results of fertiliser.</text><text>In just a few steps, the application will lead you to the correct settings for your spreader, any time of the day, wherever you want for almost any type of fertiliser.</text><text>The spreading chart application (App) can be downloaded free of charge through the Apple App Store and/or through the Google Play Store.</text><text>61</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="62"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Setting the spreader</text><text>62</text><image /><text>Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material</text><text>You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with the materials could lead to personal injury.</text><text>Be careful that nothing gets jammed</text><text>It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully while making adjustments:</text><text>· switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition,</text><text>· engage the parking brake of the tractor,</text><text>· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with filling, adjusting or testing,</text><text>· Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured spreader,</text><text>· Comply carefully with the instructions.</text><text>Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.</text><text>Protecting the environment</text><text>Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.</text><text>Work with a closed cabin</text><text>Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.</text><text>Set the spreader based on the details obtained from the correct spreading chart, the desired application rate (kg/ha) and the driving speed (km/h).</text><text>You can find the methods for determining the correct spreading chart in</text><text> the instruction manual of the software.</text><text>The spreading chart page contains information about the fertiliser to which this chart relates.

This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.</text><text>If you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres.

The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.</text><text>The discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point, of the spreading chart.</text><text>Always check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).</text><text> see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.</text><text>In the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader.

The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen.
