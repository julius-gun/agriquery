The discharge point setting depends on the fertiliser type and the flowrate in kg/min.</text><text>The letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate is given in the spreading chart. The spreading computer determines the correct setting with the input working and spreading chart data.</text><text>Spreading pattern form</text><text>The spreading pattern is normally a triangle that completely overlaps. A trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate. This spreading pattern has an overlapping area of less than 100%.</text><text>Reducing working width during the pass</text><text>The control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.</text><text>The spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this.</text><text>25</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="26"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>Display of the sections in the main screen</text><image /><image /><text>Shown in the GEOCONTROL screen</text><text>Active sections</text><image caption="Active sections" /><text>INDICATION</text><text>INDICATION</text><text>The active sections are displayed in black triangles in the main screen for both sides:</text><text>· The working width of 24 metres is divided into sections and controlled by the GEOCONTROL.</text><text>The working width reduction per section is displayed in the main screen by leaving out a part of the triangle at a time and displaying the new working width.</text><text>· Here, sections to the left are closed.</text><text>The GEOCONTROL screen also displays the section of activities in a bar below the screen.</text><text>Check the accuracy of the discharge point letter setting by conducting a spreading pattern test (tray test).</text><text> See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.</text><text>Take note of the exact driving distance and make sure there are tramlines.</text><text>If you want to change the application rate or change to another fertiliser type (with similar working width and driving speed), you only have to enter a new flowrate starting value and relevant dosing setting and adapt the discharge point letter setting, if required.</text><text>26</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="27"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>RATE control</text><image /><image /><text>MULTIRATE</text><image /><text>Greenseeker</text><image /><text>RATE control is a variable application rate triggered by an external signal.</text><text>No additional licence key is required.</text><text>.</text><text> See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual</text><text>MULTIRATE can be used on your ISOBUS weighing spreader.</text><text>An additional licence key is required to enable the software module.</text><text>MULTIRATE automatically adjusts the amount of fertiliser per side.

For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.</text><text>The spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.</text><text> See the software instruction manual.</text><text>The working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands. Field data imported from a new management system or a newly created field boundary is used for this purpose.</text><image /><text>30</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="31"><text>flowrate (kg/min)</text><image /><text>INDICATION</text><text>Dosing setting</text><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>The computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate with the following formula:</text><text>Flowrate required = (kg/min)</text><text>Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)</text><text>600</text><text>Automatic Calibration test</text><text>With the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute, the computer determines what dosing setting corresponds with what flowrate. This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all. A shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.</text><text> See the software instruction manual.</text><text>Use spreading chart</text><text>To determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate, the computer needs at least 1 measuring point. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.</text><text>To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.</text><text>If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.</text><text>31</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="32"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>The ISO tractor</text><text>Tractor with IsoMatch</text><image /><text>Conversion to ISO tractor with IsoMatch power cable set</text><image /><image /><text>32</text><text>ISOBUS tractor connection</text><text>The switching functions and data transfer between the tractor terminal or ISO control box and the machine are operated via the ISOBUS.
