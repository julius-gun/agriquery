The coupling shaft provided is too long for most types of tractors
The coupling shaft must be cut to the correct length before connecting it to the tractor. A coupling shaft that is too long could lead to serious damage to the machine and the tractor.
 See the paragraph »Checking the coupling shaft length« below
 and the below paragraph »Shortening the coupling shaft«.
During lifting and lowering of the power lift, the coupling shaft requires adequate space for:
· sliding in and out,
· sufficient overlap between the profiled tubes when driving the machine in the extreme operating angle of the coupling shaft.
Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine
This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.
The length of the coupling shaft and the shortening thereof must be done after the power lift has been connected, but before the coupling shaft has been connected.
 Lift the machine with the power lift until the PTO shaft and the machine drive axle are level.
This is the shortest possible length between the two shafts.
 Place the machine on a supporting beam.
 Switch the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the coupling shaft for it to be two halves.
 Mount the loose tractor section of the coupling shaft to the tractor PTO shaft.
 Attach the loose machine component of the coupling shaft to the drive axle.
 Manually align the two coupling shaft halves.
 Check the length and adjust it as described below.<|begin_of_text|>

Before first use
The profiled tubes must overlap as far as possible, with a minimum of 150 mm.
The profiled tubes must however have at least 25 mm free clearance at the outer edges when the tractor PTO shaft and the machine drive axle are level.
 Cut off the two profiled tubes to achieve the 25 mm clearance.
 Deburr both ends.
 Clean the coupling shaft.
 Shorten the protection sleeves by the same length.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Connect the coupling shaft of the machine and the tractor.
 Lift the machine with the power lift in the highest operating position.
Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine
This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.
The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30 ° when lifted and 30 ° when lowered.This is the maximum length between the PTO shaft and the machine drive axle.
 Place the machine on a supporting beam wit the power lift in the highest position.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Check if the furthest working angle is less than 30 °.
 Check that the overlap of the profiled tubes is still at least 150 mm.
 Remove the tractor section.
 Apply grease to the profiled tubes.
 Attach the protection sleeves.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Mount the coupling shaft to the machine.
Always mount the check chains of the protection sleeves
The check chains prevent the protection sleeves from rotating with the coupling shaft. Crop or pieces of clothing can be wound around rotating protection sleeves and cause material damage and possibly severe physical injury.
 Mount the check chains to both outer edges of the coupling shaft protective sleeves.
 Mount the other ends of the chains to a fixed point of the tractor and machine respectively. System settings

Neutralise the controls
Control devices, e.g. ropes, hoses, etc. for remote actuation of devices such as cylinders, shall be guided and positioned in a way they never inadvertently release nor block desired movements/actuations! Unintentional movements can lead to serious injury.
Connecting and disconnecting safely
There are risks of injury involved in connecting and disconnecting the machine. Work carefully:
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· a mobile machine must also be protected from rolling away while being connected,
· the machine should only be connected and disconnected from the tractor on a firm, dry and flat surface so that the machine would not tilt and/or sink into the ground,
· ensure no other people are in the immediate vicinity of the tractor or the machine,
· work in accordance with the guidelines provided in this user's manual
· a power lift that conforms with the regulations must be used,
· never stand between the tractor and machine while the power lift is operated externally while connecting or disconnecting the machine,
· the machine must only be connected to the points intended for that purpose,
· the machine must only be connected or disconnected while the PTO shaft is off,
· check the state of the machine in order to ensure that it can safely be operated and transported.
Connecting or disconnecting the machine in an unsafe manner could lead to serious personal injury and damage to the machine.
Always mount the check chains of the protection sleeves
The check chains prevent the protection sleeves from rotating with the coupling shaft. Crop or pieces of clothing can be wound around rotating protection sleeves and cause material damage and possibly severe physical injury.
Check the coupling shaft
Check the following points before the PTO shaft is attached. Has the coupling shaft:
· no damage, including the protection sleeves?
· are there sufficient lubricants as prescribed?
· is the prescribed overlap of the coupling shaft halves and protection sleeves, both in transport and in operating position?
· Are the protection sleeves attached with chains to a fixed point to guard against turning?
An unsafe or improperly mounted coupling shaft could lead to serious or deadly injury.
If the coupling shaft does not comply with the points mentioned above, it must be replaced before using the machine.

Stabiliser chain
Front power lift
Connecting to the tractor
There is an option of two tension levels, depending on the height of the crop. The high hitch points are for normal use, the low hitch points are used if the maximum lifting height of the tractor is not sufficient to ensure that the spreading height is 75 cm above the crop.
The low hitch points are also used when fertilising high crops, which is known as top dressing.
For further adjustments with top dressing, see
 paragraph »Spreading height« on page 95.
The space between the spreader and the tractor is limited as far as possible in order to keep the centre of gravity as closely to the tractor as possible. This promotes stability and the road behaviour of the tractor. As a result the coupling shaft, hydraulic hoses and electric plugs must be connected first, followed by the power lift.
 Move the tractor to the front of the spreader so that the catch hooks of the power lift are around 200 mm from the spreader (the maximum distance depends on the reach of the coupling shaft; the halves must always overlap each other).
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system of the tractor.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Put the lower links of the tractor level with the machine linkage pins.
 Compensate for any height difference with the lift rod adjustment of the power lift.
 Adjust the stabiliser chains to make lateral movement of the lower links impossible.
 Mount the appropriate ball bearings to the linkage pins and the top.
 Secure the linkage pins and top again.
Only connect the machine to the front power lift if:
· it has sufficient lifting power,
· it falls within the same fixing category as the machine,
· with linkage frame (optional extras) for tractors with power lift of Cat. 3 / 4,
· the minimum and maximum load of the front and rear weight would not be exceeded,
· the tractor has a closed cabin and proper air filters (active carbon filters).

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
The data for the correct setting of your spreader can be found in the spreading charts in the spreading chart book and the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.
 See also paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
The spreading charts indicate what type of fertiliser is best suited to achieving a good distribution. Correct adjustment depends on the characteristics of the fertiliser, not the brand! Determine the characteristics of the fertiliser, therefore, and find the spreading chart with similar features. Use the chart, even if the brand of the fertiliser differs from the nearest comparable fertiliser!
Select the spreading chart based on the characteristics of the fertiliser and not on the brand!
In order to find the correct spreading chart in the spreading chart book, online spreading chart service on the website, or via the free application (App) on your mobile phones, you must collect the following physical properties of the fertiliser
· type and pattern of the granules
 see the paragraph below,»Determine the type and pattern of the granules«
· distribution (= composition of granules of various sizes),
 see paragraph »Determining distribution« on page 59,
· similar weight,
 See paragraph »Determining similar weight« on page 60.
Distribution is the most vital characteristic of the fertiliser when it comes to spreading. You can make the first selection from the (online) spreading charts based on the distribution. Never use a spreading chart for another type of fertiliser, even if the distribution is very similar! You can determine which spreading chart compares the best to the fertiliser you are using based on similar weight.
Select the type of fertiliser from the spreading chart that is closest to the type of fertiliser that you are using.
The characteristics of the various types of fertiliser are so far reaching that using a spreading chart for another type of fertiliser, even if the distribution is the same, could provide a bad spreading pattern and could harm the crop!

Determining distribution
[Image]

To be done before spreading
The distribution is the ratio of granules with different diameters. A distribution meter comes with every spreader. This meter has 4 sections, with seven parts. The seven have different mesh width that divide the fertiliser granules, based on their diameters.
Distribution of 0-70-30-0 indicates none of the granules has a diameter of less than 2.0 mm, 70% have a diameter between 2.0 - 3.3 mm, 30% have a diameter between 3.3 - 4.75 mm and none is larger than 4.75 mm.
You should therefore do the following to determine the distribution of the fertiliser with the distribution meter:
 Fill the slot that reads 4.75 mm and close the other openings with the cover.
 Close the distribution meter with the cover and keep it on its side.
 Shake it for as long as no more smaller granules are falling through the sieves.
 Turn the distribution meter back up and read the content of each slot. The given percentages should add up to 100%. It could be necessary to round the readings off with small and round granules.
 Repeat the steps above three times and then determine the average distribution.
TIP Fill the fraction meter from another part of the hopper in order to obtain a good average as the larger granules tend to roll to the outer part of the hopper.
TIP Clean the seven parts regularly in order to prevent them from getting blocked.

The last figure indicates how you can read the following distribution: 0-70-30-0
Indication with regard to the distribution:
· If the diameter of 10% or more of the fertiliser granules is smaller than 2.0 mm the fertiliser type would be difficult to spread, especially with large working widths. This could result in a less than optimal distribution and could damage the crops.
· If the diameter of 80 - 100% of the fertiliser granules is between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertiliser would be good to spread, irrespective of the size of the remaining granules.
· If the diameter of 20% or more of the fertiliser granules is greater than 4.75 mm it would be difficult for optimum distribution. This could lead to damage to the crops as the granules could make holes in the leaves of the crop.

Determining similar weight
[Image]
Finding the correct spreading chart
60
The density is the weight (kg) of 1 litre of fertiliser and it is expressed as kg/litre or ton/m3.
The following material is required to determine the density:
· measuring beaker (supplied),
· scale (supplied).
 Refer to the scale manual.
Working method to determine similar weight:
 Hang the empty and dry measuring beaker on the scale.
 Press the scale to 0.
 Fill the measuring beaker.
 Knock the measuring beaker 5 times on firm ground.
 Fill up the measuring beaker.
 Weigh the fertiliser.
 Repeat the steps above three times in order to determine the average weight.
Density of at least 1 kg/l is desirable for a good distribution of the fertiliser. Lighter types of fertiliser would be more difficult to spread and the maximum working width would be limited.
On the basis of the data you collected about your fertiliser, for the spreading chart of fertiliser with the best comparable properties and desired working width in the table of contents of your spreading chart book, or fill in the data through the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.  see paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on the following page.
You can find the settings for the spreader, based on the application rate and the driving speed.
 See then paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
TIP the page indicated in the table of index of the spreading chart book indicates the settings for the smallest desirable working width. The spreading charts for larger working widths are on the pages that follow those.<|begin_of_text|>

To be done before spreading
Information about the settings of the spreader can be found in the
spreading chart book, but also via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system. This will also provide information about additional types of fertiliser that have been tested recently. You can make use of the online spreading chart service as an alternative to the spreading chart book. You must enter the characteristics of the fertiliser, your working width, application rate, driving speed and the type of fertiliser. You will then receive advice from the website for setting your spreader: dosing setting, discharge point, flowrate, vane combination and angle of the spreader.
Methods for adjusting the spreader can be found at:  chapter »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
Also check the advice given on the online spreading chart service. Do a calibration test to check the dosing setting. Then check the spreading pattern with a tray test.
 See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.
You can reach the spreading chart service as follows:
 Go to the website of the Kverneland Group: http://www.Kvernelandspreadingcharts.com.
 The various languages are given at the top of the page.
 Start the spreading chart service and complete the details required.
 The spreading chart service will then request that you select a product with comparable characteristics.
 The spreading chart service will then indicate the settings for your spreader. Follow the working methods as described in
 paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
AutosetApp gives you the option to download these spreading charts to the IsoMatch Tellus terminal in order to set the spreader automatically. After choosing the desired fertiliser type, the working width, application rate, driving speed, dosing and discharge opening are transmitted to the spreader using the AutosetApp. The spreader then automatically gets the correct setting. Automatic adjustment of the discharge point only applies to GEOSPREAD spreaders. The same data may be transmitted to the spreader via the AutosetApp for the other weighing spreader models such as Exacta-CL EW and Exacta-TL(X). Except for the discharge opening, the spreader then has to be set manually.
Using the Kverneland Group spreading charts application, you can easily find the right settings for your spreader.
The spreading charts application gives you immediate access to the most up-to-date test results of fertiliser.
In just a few steps, the application will lead you to the correct settings for your spreader, any time of the day, wherever you want for almost any type of fertiliser.
The spreading chart application (App) can be downloaded free of charge through the Apple App Store and/or through the Google Play Store.

Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with the materials could lead to personal injury.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully while making adjustments:
· switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with filling, adjusting or testing,
· Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured spreader,
· Comply carefully with the instructions.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
Set the spreader based on the details obtained from the correct spreading chart, the desired application rate (kg/ha) and the driving speed (km/h).
You can find the methods for determining the correct spreading chart in
 the instruction manual of the software.
The spreading chart page contains information about the fertiliser to which this chart relates. Here you will also find the settings you need to perform in respect of your spreader:<|begin_of_text|>

To be done before spreading
Working width
The working width must be selected to set the spreader. This could for instance be the distance between the sprayer tramlines.
In the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system, look for the page that shows the desired working width of the fertiliser type with the most similar properties.
Various types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.
If you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres. Enter the actual working width into the control system so that the selected application rate is correctly distributed.
The working width is adjusted with:
· the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and
· the discharge point.
The working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox. Which terminal (turtle or hare) you need to use is listed in the (online) spreading chart and depends on the desired working width.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Detach the coupling shaft from the machine.
 Attach the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point.
