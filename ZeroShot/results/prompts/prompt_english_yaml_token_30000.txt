      2: Driving speed signal not correctly set
      3: Incorrect driving speed signal
      4: Incorrect distance between the driving  tracks
      5: New type of fertiliser spread with the  same settings as the previous type.

      1: Rpm on the spreading discs too high
      2: agitator grinds. Dosing units closed for too  long with the PTO shaft running

    Solution:
      0: Contact your supplier. Update the storage area. Spread with smaller working
        widths as far  as possible
      1: Check the PTO shaft speed and the cou- pling shaft mounting point
      2: Switch the PTO shaft off after closing the  dosing units. Check the agitator
        for damage
      3: Spreading disc not disconnected while  border spreading with the border spread-
        ing plate
      4: Determine the distribution and spread  with small working widths if possible
      5: Check the type, pattern and distribution. Spread with smaller working widths
        as far  as possible
      6: Determine the characteristics of the fertil- iser, look for the relevant

      14: Spreader does  not appear on  the screen
      15: Spreader does  not appear on  the screen
    Possible cause:
      0: Discharge bushing makes contact with  the spreading disc
      1: Spreader put down with filled hopper
      2: Spreading disc hidden/ out of balance
      3: Build-up of fertiliser at the agitator and/or  spreading discs
      4: Shut down the PTO shaft immediately!
      5: Great imbalance in the spreading discs
      6: Bent agitator axle or damaged agitator
      7: PTO shaft working angle out of working  reach
      8: The control system cannot perform re- quested function correctly
      9: RS232 plug does not have the correct  connection on the side of the control
        box  for the signal from the external system
      10: The control box and external systems are  not communicating with each other
        in the  same language
      11: Application rate control by means of an  external signal is not connected
      12: External system not switched on or incor- rectly set
      13: Control box displays another system
      14: Spreader ISO plug not connected
      15: Power supply to the spreader and/or con- trol box interrupted
    Solution:
      0: Please contact your dealer
      1: Repair the machine.  Set dosing mechanism and discharge  point again
      2: Check the spreading discs for damage  and for the presence of all the vanes
      3: Remove the fertiliser. Clean the machine well after each use.
      4: Attend to the problem to prevent damage
      5: Check the vanes and spreading discs
      6: Replace the agitator axle or the agitator
      7: Limit the working angle to a maximum of  30º
      8: Consult meaning and advice in the soft- ware instruction manual.
      9: Check and modify the plug pin occupation  on the side of the control box,
        see user's  manual for control box and external sys- tem
      10: Check the control box settings by means  of the external system data, see
        user's  manual for the control box, tractor, Tellus  and external system
      11: Switch on the external signal reception See the software instruction manual.
      12: Check external system operation
      13: Press the switch key to choose the  spreader display
