For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.</text><text>The spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.</text><text> See the software instruction manual.</text><text>The working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands. Field data imported from a new management system or a newly created field boundary is used for this purpose.</text><image /><text>30</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="31"><text>flowrate (kg/min)</text><image /><text>INDICATION</text><text>Dosing setting</text><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>The computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate with the following formula:</text><text>Flowrate required = (kg/min)</text><text>Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)</text><text>600</text><text>Automatic Calibration test</text><text>With the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute, the computer determines what dosing setting corresponds with what flowrate. This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all. A shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.</text><text> See the software instruction manual.</text><text>Use spreading chart</text><text>To determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate, the computer needs at least 1 measuring point. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.</text><text>To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.</text><text>If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.</text><text>31</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="32"><text>Getting familiar with the machine</text><text>The ISO tractor</text><text>Tractor with IsoMatch</text><image /><text>Conversion to ISO tractor with IsoMatch power cable set</text><image /><image /><text>32</text><text>ISOBUS tractor connection</text><text>The switching functions and data transfer between the tractor terminal or ISO control box and the machine are operated via the ISOBUS.

A special cable set is required for this.</text><text> See paragraph »Directly to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection in the tractor cabin« on page 144.</text><text>The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM.
