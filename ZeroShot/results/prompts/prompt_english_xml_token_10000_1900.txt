Filling the machine while it is on the ground could lead to damage.</text><text>Work with a closed cabin</text><text>Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets.

These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.</text><text>· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.</text><text>· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.</text><text>· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.</text><text>· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.</text><text>You can fill the spreader to the desired levels after it has been put in place. It is recommended that the machine be loaded while it is lifted 10 cm above the soil. If no activities need to be performed on top of the hopper, the height can be adjusted with the automatic filling system.</text><text>A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in</text><text> paragraph »Technical specifications« on page 36.</text><text> If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.</text><text> Lower the machine at the desired level. The machine must not rest on the ground, but rather be lifted a minimum distance of 10 cm!</text><text> Check if the dosing units are closed. Close them if necessary by pressing the stop key on the main screen.</text><text>The position of the dosing units is displayed in the main screen on the control box of the control system.</text><text> Switch the electronic control system off.</text><text> Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.</text><text> Engage the parking brake of the tractor.</text><text> Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.</text><text> Place wheel chocks in front of the wheels of the tractor.</text><text> If a mobile loading platform is being used, place the loading platform at the spreader so that there would be a maximum distance of 200 mm between the two.</text><text> Open the hopper cover.</text><text> Check if the sieve is closed and secured.</text><text> Fill the machine to the desired level with the correct tools.

Make sure no objects or tools fall into the hopper. as it could block or damage the spreader!</text><text> Close the hopper cover.</text><text>Do not exceed the maximum recommended weight!  See also »Technical specifications« on page 36. The machine has not been constructed to carry the additional weight. Keep the axle load, load capacity of the wheels and the total weight of the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted</text><text>machines« on page 13.</text><text>INDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.</text><text>INDICATION</text><text>If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.</text><text>75</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="76"><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>Spreading pattern check (tray test)</text><text>76</text><text>Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material</text><text>You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.</text><text>Be careful that nothing gets jammed</text><text>It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:</text><text>· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,</text><text>· engage the parking brake of the tractor,</text><text>· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,</text><text>· carefully follow the instructions given.</text><text>Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.</text><text>The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!</text><text>Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.</text><text>Protecting the environment</text><text>Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.</text><text>PTO shaft rotates after disengaging</text><text>After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.</text><text>Work with a closed cabin</text><text>Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.</text><text>A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.</text><text>Tray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.</text><text>We recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.</text><image /></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="77"><image /><text>INDICATION</text><text>To be done before spreading</text><text>When to perform the tray test:</text><text>· When using a fertiliser type that is not in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.</text><text>· When using a fertiliser type of which the distribution and density deviate from the values indicated in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.</text><text>· When using fertiliser of moderate quality.</text><text>· Test should be carried out annually on the left and the right side to check the equal distribution of both spreading discs.</text><text>· After each change to the spreading mechanism of the spreader or when parts are replaced.</text><text>Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test.
