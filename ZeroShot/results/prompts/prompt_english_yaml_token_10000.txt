      7: Dosing setting and flowrate not entered  on the 'Curve Calibration' screen
        before  starting work activities
      8: Incorrect application rate, working width  and/or letter value discharge
        point en- tered
      9: The control system is being operated  manually, so it does not perform automat-
        ic calibration
      10: Incorrect values entered after a manual  calibration test at a manually
        entered ap- plication rate
      11: The speedometer is incorrect or not  measuring

      14: The stop of one or both of the actuators  have been moved
      15: Discharge is blocked on the one side
    Solution:
      0: Check the dosing setting
      1: Set the dosing setting for fine application  as per the instructions
      2: Set the correct source of the driving speed  signal in the control system,
        as well as the  control box
      3: Calibrate the driving speed
      4: Always set the driving tracks before  spreading
      5: Determine the characteristics of the fertil- iser, look for the relevant
        spreading chart  and set the spreader again
      6: Clean the machine well after each use. Replace the agitator if it is worn
        out
      7: Find the correct values in the spreading  chart and enter them
      8: Enter the correct values in the control sys- tem
      9: Switch to automatic operation
      10: Perform the calibration test in the correct  manner and enter the result
        obtained
      11: Check the sensors and cables and cali- brate the wheel sensor or radar
      12: Adjust the simulated driving speed on the  main screen or the real driving
        speed
      13: Check the settings
      14: Check the position of the connecting  points and readjust them
      15: Clean the machine well after each use. Replace the agitator if it is worn
        out

    Possible cause:
      0: Average quality fertiliser (too soft, broken,  mixed types) or incorrect
        storage
      1: Rpm on the spreading discs too high
      2: agitator grinds. Dosing units closed for too  long with the PTO shaft running
      3: Right agitator grinds
      4: Average quality fertiliser. 80% of the gran- ules with a diameter between
        2.0 - 4.75  mm
      5: Blend of fertiliser types used. A blend can  become unmixed again or types
        of fertil- iser could contain varying spreading qual- ities
      6: New type of fertiliser spread with the  same settings as the previous type.
        Qual- ity varies greatly between types.
      7: Use of wrong spreading chart
      8: 'Working with unfavourable weather con- ditions: high levels of humidity,
        rain, heat  or high wind speeds (> 5 m/sec)'
      9: Incorrect overlapping of the spreading  pattern
      10: Horizontal/vertical settings of the machine  not correct
      11: Spreader not set to the correct height
      12: Working width incorrect
      13: Worn or missing vanes
      14: Tyre pressure on the left and right not the  same
      15: The setting mechanism of the discharge  point is not set well
      16: The dosing mechanism is not set well
    Solution:
      0: Contact your supplier. Update the storage area. Spread with smaller working
        widths as far  as possible
      1: Check the PTO shaft speed and the cou- pling shaft mounting point
      2: Switch the PTO shaft off after closing the  dosing units. Check the agitator
        for damage
      3: Spreading disc not disconnected while  border spreading with the border spread-
        ing plate
      4: Determine the distribution and spread  with small working widths if possible
      5: Check the type, pattern and distribution. Spread with smaller working widths
        as far  as possible
      6: Determine the characteristics of the fertil- iser, look for the relevant
        spreading chart  and set the spreader again
      7: Determine the characteristics of the fertil- iser and select the correct
        spreading chart
      8: Only work under good weather conditions
      9: Always set the driving tracks before  spreading
      10: Check if the machine is standing level  horizontally and vertically.
      11: Check and set to the correct working  height (75 cm above the crops or soil)
      12: Check the discharge point letter and the  PTO shaft RPM
      13: Check the vanes
      14: Check the tyre pressure
      15: Perform the »Checking and setting the  discharge point setting mechanism«
