Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting and checking the spreader.
Work safely while checking and adjusting:
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be 1.0 mm.
If the distance is too great, the fertiliser does not flow through the discharge point opening onto the spreading disc but onto a random point below the discharge bushing. This results in a disrupted spreading pattern.
If the distance is too short, a full hopper may rest partly on the spreading disc, which seriously damages the machine as a result.
 Attach the empty machine and raise it to working height (75 cm).
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Place heavy, stable supports under the ends of the lifting arms.
 Lower the arms onto the supports. Now the machine cannot drop accidentally.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Measure the distance between the spreading disc and the discharge bushing.
You can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately.
If the measured distance is more or less than 1.0 mm, do the following:
 Remove the dashboard by loosening the 3 fixing knobs.
 Turn the lock nuts on the 4 fastening bolts with which the dosing mechanism is attached to the hopper a few times to loosen them.<|begin_of_text|>

Maintenance
 Turn the nuts on the 4 fastening bolts so that the dosing mechanism moves upward.
The dosing mechanism is now higher than the spreading disc and discharge bushing. Turn the dosing mechanism upwards until you have good access to the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.
 Unscrew the bolts attaching the discharge bush to the star a few times.
 Move the discharge bushing upwards or downwards until the distance to the spreading disc is 1.0 mm.
You can also put 1.0 mm thick plates between the discharge bush and the spreading disc and lower the discharge bush onto them.
 Turn on the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.
 Check the height again and adjust it if necessary.
 Lower the dosing mechanism by turning the fastening bolt nuts upward.
Lower the dosing mechanism until the bayonet ring has moved halfway across the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the star.
 Check the position of the dosing mechanism relative to the agitator axle. The distance between the agitator axle and the sealing ring must be the same on all sides.
 See paragraph »Checking and setting the dosing mechanism« on page 133.
 Turn on the lock nuts on 4 fastening bolts without moving the dosing mechanism again.
 Check that the agitator is not in contact with the bolts attaching the agitator seal ring.
 Reattach the dashboard with the three fixing knobs.
 Perform the check on the other side as well.
 Finally, check the position of the dosing mechanism and the position of the dosing baffle as described in

Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The agitator axle is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent fertiliser granule loss along the agitator axle. The seal must be replaced every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours. Only work on a clean machine with an empty hopper.
 Set the fine application handle to the normal dosing setting.
 Start the tractor and engage the control box.
 Activate the empty hopper function.
 Please refer to the software instruction manual
 Wait until both actuators are completely extended and the dosing units are completely open.
 Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.<|begin_of_text|>

The latest developments in ISOBUS communication between tractor and implement and ease-of-use are all incorporated into the IsoMatch Tellus GO.
A scroll wheel on the upper right of the box and an additional keyboard make menu navigation easy.
Connect the ISOBUS tractor via IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable
If your tractor is provided with a full ISOBUS connection, a connection with the 9-pins in Cab cable between your tractor and the IsoMatch Tellus GO control box is sufficient.
Other connections are made via the "Input IM Tellus" cable, supplied as a standard item.
