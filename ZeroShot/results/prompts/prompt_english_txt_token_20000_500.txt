Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!
Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.
Tray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.
We recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
When to perform the tray test:
· When using a fertiliser type that is not in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using a fertiliser type of which the distribution and density deviate from the values indicated in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using fertiliser of moderate quality.
· Test should be carried out annually on the left and the right side to check the equal distribution of both spreading discs.
· After each change to the spreading mechanism of the spreader or when parts are replaced.
Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test. The tray test should be performed with dry weather, low humidity and with a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2).
Material required
· measuring tape or ruler,
· spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
· 7 troughs,
· 7 graduated tubes,
· 1 funnel,
· notebook, pen and calculator,
· this manual.
· the instruction manual of the software.
General instructions
 Check the preset dosing setting and the discharge point.
 Check the height (75 cm above the troughs) and the position (angle) of the spreader.
 Check the rpm of the PTO shaft and the spreader discs.
 Always place the buckets horizontally on the floor.
 Place the buckets at a maximum distance of 4 metres. Provide additional widths for testing widths of more than 24 meters. Also, you can first test part of the working width and then empty the trays and distribute them over the rest of the working width.
 Do not use the spreader while it is raining or with high humidity. This will cause the fertiliser to cling to the troughs, which would not provide the desired results.
 Do not spread with wind speeds of more than 3 m/s (wind force of 2).

Test the left and right spreading patterns
INDICATION
[Image]
The left and right spreading discs must spread the same volumes of fertiliser to ensure good distribution. Check this every year!
This test describes a working width of 24 metres. You are of course free to run the test for a different working width. Divide the buckets at equal distances along the working width.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the left spreading disc by sliding the connector to he left. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Search the correct discharge position to spread over 24 metres in the best comparable fertiliser, seeds or granules (online) spreading chart and set the handle accordingly.
 See paragraph »Discharge point« on page 65 and the foreword of the spreading chart book.
 Fit the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point of the central gearbox as indicated in the associated spreading chart.
 See paragraph »Coupling shaft connection point« on page 64.
 Check the height of the spreader (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
 Place the other troughs 4 metres to the right of the tractor tracks.

 Switch off the automatic calibration.
 Engage the PTO shaft and set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 Open the right dosing unit.
 Drive over the first trough and stop only after you have driven at least 20 metres past this trough. This is because the spreader distributes roughly even to the back, front and to the side.
 Close the dosing unit.
 Empty the trough with a funnel into the graduated tubes and record the reading in your notebook.
Repeat the above procedure, but disconnect the right spreading disc and switch the dosing unit of the right spreading disc off. Put the troughs on the left side of the tractor track.

Assessment
 Record the values you find in the graduated tubes for the left and right spreading discs.
 Compare the values, calculate the percentage differences between the measuring tubes on the left and the right.
Adaptation
If the spreading patterns on the left and right spreading discs are not the same and the difference is greater than 3% you will have to do the following, or request your dealer to do so:
 Check if the machine is hanging horizontally and vertically behind the tractor in length and width.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the dosing mechanism« as described on page 133 and repeat the test.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism« as described on page 136 and repeat the test.

Full field spreading pattern test
[Image]
To be done before spreading
If the spreader is correctly set and the tramlines are set at the correct distance from each other you would achieve a good distribution of fertiliser over the land. This will only be achieved if the spreader spreads with the correct spreading pattern.
This is then the reason why you have to test the spreading pattern and adjust it as required.
 See also paragraph »Full field spreading pattern« on page 28.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width (X metre) that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
 Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.
The actual width is twice the size of the effective working width!
If you want to spread over a working width of 24 metres, place the buckets at 24/6 metres = 4 metres.

Reducing the PTO shaft rpm and closing the right spreading disc also have an influence on the spreading pattern on the left side of the spreader. The full field spreading pattern should therefore be tested when using the border spreading plate.
Follow the instructions, adjusted for border spreading, as described in  paragraph »Full field spreading pattern test« on page 81.
Operation
 Do not change the position of the border spreading plate and disconnect the right or left spreading disc.
With the first time:
 Do not change the settings of the spreader, the PTO shaft rpm or the driving speed as these should be the same as settings for border spreading.
With the second time:
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Set the spreader for full field spreading.
 Set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 The driving speed and PTO shaft rpm must be the same as the first time.
Assessment
The middle buckets could contain less application rate. The pattern on illustration B from
 paragraph »Full field spreading pattern test« on page 81.
This is because of the lower PTO shaft rpm.
The level of the middle measuring tube in border spreading could be 25% lower than with the outer graduated tubes.
Adaptation

Observe the permissible and safe height with regard to
· prescribed maximum height for vehicles in the road traffic regulations,
· high-voltage cables or other cables over the road;
· anticipated maximum headroom.
Pay close attention to these aspects to prevent dangerous situations that could lead to major material damage and possibly to serious physical injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check whether the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (<40km/h) on your tractor, is hidden by the implement.
 Then fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.

Friction between moving parts
Be careful of moving parts making contact with each other while working. You could accidentally touch control levers and cause the machine to move.
Only start working once all machine parts have stopped and the control lever have been secured. Wear safety shoes and gloves and work alone. If something gets jammed it could lead to personal injury.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.<|begin_of_text|>

INDICATION
Use in the field
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist weather conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Before you can make the first pass, you must make adjustments in the field to:
The following is important to ensure that the spreader works properly:
· set it to the correct height from the ground or above the crop and
· by levelling it with the lift rod adjustment and top link.
Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.
 Use the power lift to lift the machine to the correct height.
 Set the spreader horizontally with the lift rod adjustment and the top link.
 Lock the lift limiter in this position.
Height correction with top dressing
If the required height of 75 cm above the crop is not possible with your power lift
 use the high spreading setting of the linkage pins and/or
 set the spreader forward as indicated in the spreading charts.

A checklist is given below, as well as in the jacket of the spreading chart.
 Do this last check to ensure good spreading results.
Are you working with the correct settings from the correct spreading chart, based on:
· distribution,
· similar weight,
· type of fertiliser,
· desired working width,
· desired driving speed?
Did you set the spreader in the correct way? Did you:
· set the height over the ground or crops to 75 cm?
· was the correct vane combination mounted?
· are the correct number of dosing openings opened (fine application)?
· is the correct discharge point set?
· is the correct application rate set?
· is the correct GEOPOINT® (centre spreading pattern) set?
· is the coupling shaft fitted to the correct point on the gearbox?

Working with the GEOCONTROL
Starting a new task is done from a saved field or one to be created newly with the GEOCONTROL application.
 Refer to the GEOCONTROL manual in your terminal for this purpose.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass. The headland will act as the field boundary and is saved in GEOCONTROL.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass.
 Spread a broad or double headland so that you make the connection while driving straight before making a turn.
Thereafter, the field can be filled in full passes. You can create a (spray)track pattern for following processes.
Prevent drive errors
It is important that the spreading patterns overlap well to ensure good distribution. A difference in the overlapping is less vital with average working widths, using a triangular spreading pattern.
Differences in the spreading pattern would easily be noticed with a trapezium shape on very large working widths, in particular. The overlap of the spreading pattern is then much smaller and therefore more sensitive to mistakes.
This can be prevented by setting tramlines before hand. This can be done by setting out tramlines on the headlands and marking them with, for example, picket poles.
Visibility of the from headland to headland is very important. Place additional markers in the field if necessary to ensure that the track is clearly visible.
When controlled by the GEOCONTROL the spreader has the option of reducing the working width in order to connect the incomplete final pass with the next one.

 Switch the control box on.
 Check the settings as described in
 Without GEOCONTROL, select and activate a site number in the field registration,
 Switch on the PTO shaft and set the correct spreading disc rpm as reported in the spreading chart.
Do not allow the spreading disc to run for longer than is necessary while the dosing units are closed. This will prevent the agitator from grinding the fertiliser.
 Start driving and open the dosing units at the same time by pressing the start key.
The rpm of the tractor engine (therefore also of the PTO shaft) must remain constant while spreading (with regards to distributing fertiliser along the width).
The driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed!
Based on the offset set in the 'TC Implement Settings' screen, the GEOCONTROL will switch the spreading sections off by itself when passing the headland limit. This happens if the spreading pattern overlaps completely and you run up the headland.
Depending on the set overlap percentage, the connection on the headland and gores will more or less overlap.
The usual setting is 50%.

If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.
At low doses <50 kg/ha, it is possible to reduce the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration to minus 15 kg.
 See the software instruction manual.
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

Over and underdosing
Results of one-sided over- or underdosing
[Image]
Use in the field
Depending on soil or crop composition, it is preferable to spread more or less fertiliser locally. With the control system, you can over- or under dose to the left, right or on both sides during spreading. You will find all the control keys on the main screen.
 See the software instruction manual.
The spreading pattern of both spreading discs overlap partially, especially in the middle behind the spreader. For this reason, the real application rate will deviate from the one that you set during one-sided over- and under dosing. You will see the effect especially with narrow working widths because that is when the spreading patterns overlap the most.
With small working widths in which you spread in a triangular spreading pattern, the first and second passes of the spreading patterns overlap each other completely.
 See also paragraph »Spreading pattern« on page 28. To distribute an adjusted application rate you must therefore over- or underdose on the first as well as the second pass in the following tramline.

Border spreading
INDICATION
106
Spreading fertiliser up to the border of the property requires concentration. On the one hand you want to achieve maximum cover to the field edge to ensure a good crop, while on the other hand you want to minimise the loss over the field edge.
The spreader has 2 different functions and accessories to cater for border spreading.
· one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate,
· boundary track spreading with ExactLine.
When one-sided boundary spreading, drive with the tractor along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. With boundary track spreading, drive down the first sprayer tramline from the field edge and spray in the direction of the border.
We advise you to spread the site first before you spread the borders. During border spreading, the control system does not perform any automatic calibration, so it cannot accurately determine the correct dosing setting for the required application rate. Consequently, the application rate can deviate from the required application rate during border spreading. By spreading the field first, the control system can determine the correct dosing setting and thus spread at the correct application rate, also during border spreading.<|begin_of_text|>

One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate
Operation
[Image]
Use in the field
Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules with the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra). The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra).
Direction ( 1 ) (environmental set- ting)
Spread less to the field edge.
This will decrease the loss over the field edge, but the cover will not be as good
Direction ( 9 ) (yield setting)
Spread more to the field edge.
Cover is better, but the loss is greater
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test if the border spreading plate (optional extra) door de test therefore always before hand as described in

Left and right border spreading is possible with the hydraulic border spreading plate.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Lower the border plate.
 Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!
 Adjust the spreader based on the details given in the spreading chart for the desired working width. Use the same settings and coupling shaft mounting point as with full field spreading,
 See also paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Start the tractor again.
 Switch the control box on.
 Engage the PTO shaft. The correct rpm of the spreading discs is the value of the relevant spreading chart.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
The control system will drive the dosing units in such a way that the actual application rate is equal to the set application rate through the lower PTO shaft RPM.
In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:
 Stop spreading immediately!
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 See then paragraph »Failure and stoppage« on page 113.
After border spreading:
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Close the dosing.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 109===

Driving pattern
Use in the field
Two different driving patterns can be used, depending on the situation on your land.
Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic border spreading plate, but disconnect the right spreading disc and close the dosing unit,
 see the methods above.
 Increase the PTO shaft rpm to 100% again.
 Drive down the second path in the first sprayer tramline.
 After the second operation, link up the right spreading disc drive again.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic spreading plate.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
 Drive up the second line 1 working width from the field edge (X metres). Maintain the distance with the field edge carefully by using pickets, for instance.

Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) (=first sprayer tramline) when doing boundary track spreading with the ExactLine (accessory). The flow of fertiliser granules, seeds or other granules spread with ExactLine. The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the ExactLine position.
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test the ExactLine therefore always in advance as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The (online) spreading charts indicate the correct setting for the ExactLine and the relevant rpm for the PTO shaft and the spreading discs.
If the settings of the ExactLine are not given in the relevant spreading chart they can be obtained in the following sources:
· find with the online spreading chart service on the website or via the Free Application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
 See paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
Always check the settings of the ExactLine by performing the test as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The type of fertiliser is determined when adjusting the spreader, as described in
 paragraph »Determine the type and pattern of the granules« on page 57.
you can choose from 3 settings from the chart:
· YIELD.
· ECO,
In the yield setting (YIELD), the loss over the field edge is higher than what is allowed by the environmental standard. Therefore, never use this setting next to surface water. Cover to the border is very good with this option.
The loss over the field edge will be equal to or less than the environment standard in the environment setting (ECO). Always use this setting when working next to a surface water! The result is that the cover at the border of the property is not optimum.

 Set the ExactLine to the required position, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart.
 Start the tractor and set the correct PTO shaft and spreading discs RPM, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart or the chart on the previous page.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
 Continue operating the spreader in the same way as in full field spreading,
 See paragraph »Start spreading« on page 100.
 Check regularly while spreading to see if the symbol of the ExactLine remains on screen. If the symbol disappears the ExactLine is no longer in a good working position.
 Set the ExactLine back to transport mode after use by opening the tap in the hydraulic hose and then opening the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve for a few seconds.
The ExactLine's position is displayed on the main screen if you have connected this function.

Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
While working with the spreader, you might come into contact with fertiliser or other substances that you want to spread. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
During spreading, if you:
· see that a spreading disc is spreading irregularly or not at all while the dosing units are open,
· hear a loud noise,
· become aware that the machine is vibrating seriously,
· an alarm is shown on the main screen indicating that the PTO shaft is not connected, while it actually is connected,
· an alarm will appear on the main screen, indicating that the dosing units cannot be closed,

These failures are probably caused by one of the following:
· a hard object blocks the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking the supply from flowing to the agitator,
· a hard object or a large piece of fertiliser is (partially) blocking fertiliser from flowing through the dosing opening or discharge bushing,
· crushed and/or damp fertiliser forms an encrusted layer beneath the agitator and blocks the flow through the dosing openings,
· a lump of damp fertiliser has formed in the discharge bushing and is blocking flow from the discharge bushing opening. This happens especially when the spreader has not been thoroughly cleaned after it was last used.
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Handle with care
Cautiously approach the machine and handle with care. There could be hot or live parts! Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
To find the cause of the failure or stoppage and solve it as far as possible, proceed as follows.
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 Switch off the electronic control system.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the handbrake of the tractor.

 Examine the spreading discs and the discharge opening to see what the cause of the failure/stoppage is.
 Adapt the discharge point as needed for easier access.
 If you still cannot see the cause, carefully remove the vanes to see better into the discharge opening of the discharge bushing.
 Pass an object such as a screwdriver through the discharge opening and carefully feel if you can find an object in or damage to the dosing openings or agitator.
If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The agitator is probably damaged too. You must first repair the damage or have it repaired before continuing with spreading.
 Place an object, for example a cloth or bag, in the discharge opening of the discharge bushing on the damaged side.. This will prevent you from wasting fertiliser during transport.
 Start the tractor and engage the control box. The dosing units will now close.
 Switch off the control box.
 Take all appropriate measures for road transport.

On the site of a lockable storage depot:
 Empty the hopper without positioning the machine on the ground.
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
Lock the sieve in the open position
If you open the sieves, you should lock them to prevent unwanted closing. Accidental closure could lead to serious injury.

Storing the machine
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
It is easy to come into contact with the materials when putting away the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protect the machine
Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan. After cleaning, inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with the supplied preserving liquid point for protection against corrosion of the
machine, read the instructions before use.
Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners
You can clean the machine with water or steam, possibly using only suitable cleaning tools. Also read here and adhere to the safety instructions of the material manufacturer.
 Only use low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.
 Keep the nozzle more than 30 cm clear of turning parts, sensors, parts of the electric system, hydraulic hoses, stickers and plastic parts.
 Only spray perpendicular to sticker edges.
Waste storage and disposal
The waste water from cleaning the machine is contaminated with fertiliser and possibly also with lubrications. Collect the waste and dispose of it in terms of national regulations.

Cleaning
118
It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.
The advantages of this working order are:
· additional checks on the machine right after work,
· ensuring the longevity of the machine,
· less delays due to problems while working with the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples.
 See paragraph »Lubricating points« on page 126.
 Clean the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples once again.
When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.

Storing the machine
Disconnect safely
You may only disconnect the machine when
· all parts are in a safe condition,
· your immediate vicinity is safe,
· the hopper is empty.
Work carefully:
· check the environment (children!) and ensure that nobody is in the vicinity of the tractor or the machine,
· wear safety gloves and shoes,
· the machine or parking support must only be placed on a straight, firm surface,
· never stand between the tractor and machine while the power lift is operated externally while disconnecting the machine. Using the power lift entails the risk of accidents by crushing or jack-knifing,
· operate the power lift slowly and carefully,
· the power lift during disconnection must be placed in such a position that accidental release or lowering would be eliminated,
· sufficient distance must be maintained between parts (e.g. parking support) that rest on the ground.
Working unsafely could cause serious injuries.
Proceed as follows to store the machine in stable condition for a shorter or longer period.
 Switch off the pto shaft.
 Check that the ExactLine hydraulic hose tap is closed.
 Check that the ExactLine hydraulic hose tap of the hydraulic border spreading plate is closed.
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system.
 Place the machine on a stable, level base.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Adjust the length of the top link in such a way that it is no longer live.
 Release the top link by undoing the release rope from the catch hooks and pulling the top link up.
 Release the lower links by undoing the release ropes from the catch hooks and lowering the power lift as far as possible.
119<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 120===

Storing the machine
TIP If you cannot lower the power lift far enough to release the catch hooks, we advise you to place the spreader on a firm, stable ramp, for example a pawl.
 Drive the tractor about 200 mm forward (maximum distance depends on the range of the coupling shaft; the halves must always overlap each other).
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Put wheel chocks in place to ensure that a machine equipped with parking wheels would not roll away.
 Disconnect the electric plugs and hang them in the container.
 Disconnect the hydraulic hoses.
 Place the protective caps on the hydraulic hose connections.
 Hang the hydraulic hoses in the hose coupling support.
 Disconnect the coupling shaft and hook it up.
If the machine is equipped with parking wheels:
 Drive the machine to the desired parking place.
 Place wheel chocks in front of the parking wheels.

Preparation for winter storage
Storing the machine
At the end of the season the machine must be prepared for winter storage.
It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.
The advantages of this method of working are:
· additional checks on the machine right after work,
· ensuring the longevity of the machine,
· less delays due to problems while working with the machine.
TIP When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.

INDICATION
Furthermore, do not set up electrical components. Water can cause electrical failures.
 See »Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners« on page 117,
 Clean the machine.
 Let the machine dry.
 Paint any damaged paintwork.
 Lubricate and oil all points once again to ensure conservation.
 See paragraph »Maintenance intervals« on page 125.
 Provide white parts such as piston rods of hydraulic cylinders with preservative grease or inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with preserving liquid (supplied) for protection against corrosion.
Only use grease that would not harden or dry. That will prevent damage to cylinder oil seals.

Repair damage safely and without delay
Repair the machine safely before you continue with work:
· place the tractor and machine on a firm, straight surface,
· switching off the PTO shaft,
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· disconnect the tractor if possible,
· wait until all parts have stopped moving. The mass (inertia) could keep the machine running for a bit!
· place wheel chocks in front of the wheels of a machine with parking wheels to prevent it from rolling away,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given,
· use the correct tools,
· bigger or heavier parts must be locked and secured to lifting gear when being replaced,
· parts that could move unintentionally must be supported and secured,
· do not climb on parts of the machine that are not in use. Only use stepladders, ladders or other tools intended for this purpose.
· disconnect the feed while working on the electric system.
· disconnect the cables from the battery and the dynamo before arc welding on the tractor or the connected machine!

Maintenance
Do not modify the machine
Do not modify the machine in any way. Unauthorised modifications may impair the function and/or safety and affect the life of the machine.
Only use original parts when replacing
Using other non-genuine parts could lead to problems and unsafe situations when using the machine.
Accessories and parts must be correctly mounted
Assemble accessories and parts according to specifications and attach them only for their designated purpose; ensure that it is locked correctly. Accessories and parts which are not fastened securely could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.
Tighten all bolts and nuts
Check that all the nuts and bolts are well set. Check this again after one hour of use
· after delivery and
· after maintenance or repairs have been carried out.
Avoid jamming under the sieves
There is a risk that parts of your body may get jammed in the hopper during maintenance activities or when closing the sieves. Secure the sieve in an open position and unlock the sieves on the outside. Jamming could cause injury.
Avoid contact with materials
You should only come into contact with the materials when cleaning the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Explosion danger because of nitrate
Fertiliser that contains nitrate can create an explosion danger if it should come into contact with fire. All fertiliser remnants should therefore be removed from voids, corners, tubes and tubing before welding, cutting or grinding on the machine. An explosion will cause damage to the machine and could lead to personal injury.
Adhere to all the safety precautions as described in  paragraph »Safety requirements« from page 10.

 Remove dirt, fertiliser or grease from the gearbox.
 Open the gearbox by removing the cap from the filler opening.
 Measure the level of the grease.
 Add grease until the desired level is reached.
 Close the filler opening.
ply grease to the contact surfaces of both of the profiled tubes should you note during coupling or decoupling that the halves of the coupling shaft are not sliding in and out smoothly. This should at any rate be done at least once per season.
 Detach the coupling shaft on the one side.
 Pull the shaft halves away from each another.
 Grease the running surface of the inner profiled tube.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Attach the coupling shaft.
 Hook the check chains to the tractor side.
The central gearbox consists of 2 compartments filled with gear wheel grease EP 00/000. The grease in principle never needs to be replaced.
Each compartment holds 0.25 litre.
 Check the level regularly.
 Remove dirt, fertiliser or grease from the gearbox.
 Remove the cap from the dipstick and filler opening.
 Fill the gear box with new grease until it almost comes out of the opening.
Replace the cap.

Maintenance
Add oil
Connectors
The following parts only function well if they are provided with sufficient oil. Check this regularly.
The connectors between the central gearbox and the spreading disc gearboxes are used with border spreading and when checking the spreading pattern with the tray test. Disconnect one of the connectors from the spreading discs.
 Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding and becoming
difficult to use.

Checking the hydraulic system
[Image]
[Image]
Replacement intervals
Maintenance
Hydraulic oil is under high pressure
Never try to stop a leak with your fingers. Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!
Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars
Prevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working above the permitted pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.
Keep your distance from the hydraulics during inspecting and test running
Use a stick to bend the hydraulic hoses when checking them for leakage. That way you will keep at sufficient distance. Oil jets or hoses that snap back may cause serious physical injury due to the prevailing pressure and temperature.
Work safely on the hydraulic system
The hydraulic system could be under high pressure. Do not work on the hydraulic system without:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switching the tractor off,
· the key must be removed from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· using the proper tools,
· wear safety glasses, gloves and shoes.
Working in an unsafe manner on the hydraulic system could lead to injury and damage to the machine. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately! There is also the risk of infection!
Before operating the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage.
Regularly inspect the hydraulic system (hoses, pipes, connections). All hoses, piping and connecting points must be checked regularly, but at least once a year, by an expert for leakages or visible damage! The lifetime of a hose should be 6 years maximum (see the production date on the hoses).
Damaged or old parts must be replaced with new ones that comply with the technical specifications of the manufacturer of the machine. Damage to the hydraulic system could lead to injury.

Maintenance
Inspection criteria
Replacing instructions
132
It is not permitted to carry out repairs on hydraulic hoses! Replace hoses if the following is detected during inspection:
· damage to the exterior up to the armouring (such as abrasion marks, cuts and tears),
· the exterior becoming brittle (tears in the hose),
· distortion not normal for the pattern of the hose while under pressure, as well as without pressure or with bends, e.g. layers pealing off and blisters forming,
· leakages,
· not mounted as per requirements,
· damage or distortion of the hose block, which would compromise the strength of the block or the connection between the hose and the regulating block,
· hose coming out of the connectors,
· corrosion of the connector which would compromise the function and strength,
· exceeding the storage and the operating limits.
Only use original parts when replacing hoses. Hoses must be placed and mounted in the proper way. Be careful not to change the connections. Replaced hoses must be suitable to the permitted work pressure and be resistant to chemical, mechanical and thermal loads. Only use hose clamps made from stainless steel.
 Run the hydraulic control valves until all the cylinders are engaged.
 Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disengage the machine.
 See paragraph »Disconnecting the machine« on page 119.
 Demount the connectors with the proper tools.
 Collect the oil that drips from the cylinders and the hoses.
 Mount new hoses and put them so that they would not get pinched.
 Dispose of the collected oil as required by national legislation.
Operate the hydraulic control valves of the tractor very carefully at first after replacing the hoses as there could still be pockets of air in the pipes! Open and close all the hydraulic control valves a few times before you start working.<|begin_of_text|>

Checking and setting the dosing mechanism
[Image]
Maintenance
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting and checking the spreader.
Work safely while checking and adjusting:
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Check the settings of the dosing mechanism:
· after the first 10 running hours,
· for each season,
· after every 100 operational hours,
· if the spreading pattern between the left and right spreading discs differs more than 3%.
 See paragraph »Test the left and right spreading patterns« on page 78.

Maintenance
It is necessary to set the dosing plates to the correct positions to each other to ensure correct dosing. If the dosing openings do not close well you will loose unnecessary fertiliser and the application rate will be higher than intended with a specific dosing setting. If the baffles slide far over each other the application rate will be much lower than expected.
If the dosing plates are mounted in the correct positions, you will see a small crack of light when the dosing openings are closed.
 Close the spreader dosing units on the control box. The actuators must be closed properly.
 Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Open the sieves with the included attachment and deposit it.
 Check if you can see a small crack between the dosing baffles.
 If not, move the actuator attachment point on the dosing mechanism until a small chink is visible between the dosing plates.
 Start the tractor and open and close the dosing units by operating the start and stop keys a few times.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
