    ><text>Before leaving the tractor:</text><text>· switch the PTO shaft off,</text><text>· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,</text><text>· switch the electronic control system off,</text><text>· switch the tractor off,</text><text>· remove the key from the ignition,</text><text>· engage the parking brake of the tractor.</text><text>That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.</text><text>PTO shaft rotates after disengaging</text><text>After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.</text><text>Protecting the environment</text><text>Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.</text><text>Work with a closed cabin</text><text>Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="95"><text>Adjusting the machine</text><text>Spreading height</text><text>Ground level or the top level of the crops</text><image caption="Ground level or the top level of the crops" /><image /><text>INDICATION</text><text>Use in the field</text><text>Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks.
