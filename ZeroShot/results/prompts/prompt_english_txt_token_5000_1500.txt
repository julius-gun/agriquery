Width distribution with GEOSPREAD
Actuator for discharge point adjustment
[Image: Actuator for discharge point adjustment]
Combined control with GEOSPREAD system
Discharge point letter setting
[Image]
The spreading pattern is determined by the transverse distribution.
The discharge point is the place where the fertiliser granules come into touch with the vanes of the spreading disc and substantially determines width distribution.
Actuators for setting the discharge point
The GEOSPREAD execution has two additional actuators which set the discharge point. The discharge point setting depends on the fertiliser type and the flowrate in kg/min.
The letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate is given in the spreading chart. The spreading computer determines the correct setting with the input working and spreading chart data.
Spreading pattern form
The spreading pattern is normally a triangle that completely overlaps. A trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate. This spreading pattern has an overlapping area of less than 100%.
Reducing working width during the pass
The control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.
The spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this.

INDICATION
INDICATION
The active sections are displayed in black triangles in the main screen for both sides:
· The working width of 24 metres is divided into sections and controlled by the GEOCONTROL.
The working width reduction per section is displayed in the main screen by leaving out a part of the triangle at a time and displaying the new working width.
· Here, sections to the left are closed.
The GEOCONTROL screen also displays the section of activities in a bar below the screen.
Check the accuracy of the discharge point letter setting by conducting a spreading pattern test (tray test).
 See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.
Take note of the exact driving distance and make sure there are tramlines.
If you want to change the application rate or change to another fertiliser type (with similar working width and driving speed), you only have to enter a new flowrate starting value and relevant dosing setting and adapt the discharge point letter setting, if required.

RATE control is a variable application rate triggered by an external signal.
No additional licence key is required.
.
 See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual
MULTIRATE can be used on your ISOBUS weighing spreader.
An additional licence key is required to enable the software module.
MULTIRATE automatically adjusts the amount of fertiliser per side. The application rate to the left and right is independently based on a rate map.
You can do this on the basis of a maximum of 8 measuring points of the rate map.
This is a combined functionality between the spreader and the terminal, providing the option of using two or more variable quantities in the working width of the spreader.
A total of 8 VRA sections are supported by the spreader.
To achieve full functionality with the IsoMatch PRO Terminal, you also need the IsoMatch GEOCONTROL licence key.
When MULTIRATE signals are received, the following icon is visible.
 See the GEOCONTROL instruction manual
The ISOBUS supports the Farmfacts Greeseeker sensor. From Greenseeker version 06.00.00.0257 onwards, the software supports the reception of the external signal. Section control continues working through the Task Controller.

Spreading pattern
Full field spreading pattern
Optimum distribution of the fertiliser with minimum impact on the environment can be achieved through the settings and tools described.
The full field spreading pattern overlaps 100%
A triangular spreading pattern that completely overlaps can be expected with most fertiliser types with an average working width.

Influence of the GEOSPREAD function
One-sided boundary spreading with border spreading plate
You can drive along the field edge with a half spreading pattern filled to 100% with the border spreading plate and one closed dosing unit. You have to optimise the spreading pattern and thereby overcome environmental pollution when adjusting the border spreading plate.
[Image]
With the hydraulic border spreading plate, one-sided boundary spreading is also possible at the left.

Boundary track spreading with ExactLine
It is possible to spread right up to the border (boundary track spreading) from the first sprayer tramline with ExactLine.
A ExactLine is available for the right and the left.
Selecting the pattern for border spreading
It is not possible to completely cover the field border at the application rate and not have anything go beyond the border. Current environmental standards only allow for minimal loss over the field edge.
ExactLine
ExactLine bends the fertiliser granules in such a way that loss over the edge of the border is restricted to the bare minimum and it provides as full a spreading pattern as possible.
ExactLine has 'environment' and 'yield' settings for precisely adjusting border spreading.

The ISO control system
The automatic weighing system
The ISO control system uses the ISOBUS communication protocol, which makes it suitable for tractors that are also equipped with an ISOBUS communication system. For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.
The spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.
 See the software instruction manual.
The working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands. Field data imported from a new management system or a newly created field boundary is used for this purpose.

flowrate (kg/min)

Dosing setting
Getting familiar with the machine
The computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate with the following formula:
Flowrate required = (kg/min)
Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)
600
Automatic Calibration test
With the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute, the computer determines what dosing setting corresponds with what flowrate. This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all. A shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.
 See the software instruction manual.
Use spreading chart
To determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate, the computer needs at least 1 measuring point. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.
To prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.
If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.

ISOBUS tractor connection
The switching functions and data transfer between the tractor terminal or ISO control box and the machine are operated via the ISOBUS. Specifically tilling the site and reacting to deviating field forms or soil compositions is possible through ISOBUS communication. With GPS, various sensors and management systems are provided with the necessary information in order to control the machine optimally.
ISOBUS functionality via IsoMatch
Tractors without their own ISO terminal can work as ISO tractors with the IsoMatch control box.
Driving speed, RPM and GPS signal on IsoMatch
If speed is not measured on the (trailed) machine, but via the tractor, the speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics. A special cable set is required for this.
 See paragraph »Directly to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection in the tractor cabin« on page 144.
The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM. The extra sensor is available for this purpose.
The GPS signal can also be used via the RS 232 on the control box. This is required for the GEOCONTROL functionality.
 Also, refer to the manual that comes with your control box.
Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set
If the tractor does not have an ISOBUS communication, it can be added with the IsoMatch power cable set.
Hereafter, your tractor is entirely ISOBUS ready, and you can connect and operate the machine with the IsoMatch control box.
The driving speed of your tractor (or your trailed machine) is transmitted via the ISOBUS to the IsoMatch.
The "IM Tellus Input" cable, supplied as a standard item, can be used for other connections.<|begin_of_text|>

With the main switch on the upper left in the red extension, you can switch the control box on and off.
Press the button for at least 1 sec.
 Always switch off the control box when you leave the tractor.
If the box is engaged, unintended functions can be activated while you are in the danger area. Moreover, the control box uses power, as a result of which the tractor battery could be flattened.
After starting up, the screen with the last (two) selected applications appears.
Compact and complete
IsoMatch Go, as a handy and more compact variant of the doublescreen version, offers complete ISO control with all functions. Besides the smaller dimension with the single screen, the number of USB connections and the absence of Wlan/Wifi constitutes the biggest difference.
Many additional functions.
The latest developments in ISOBUS communication between tractor and implement and ease-of-use are all incorporated into the IsoMatch Tellus GO.
Connect the ISOBUS tractor via IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable
If your tractor is provided with a full ISOBUS connection, a connection with the 9-pins in Cab cable between your tractor and the IsoMatch Tellus GO control box is sufficient.
Other connections are made via the "Input IM Tellus" cable, supplied as a standard item.

The machine would generally be assembled and delivered ready-foruse by the dealer. The dealer is also responsible for providing instructions for use and maintenance. He/she must also ensure that the required documents are provided, such as:
· manual,
· spare parts manual
· spreading chart book,
· testing and approval documents where required.
If parts are missing or have been damaged during transport, you should report that to your dealer directly on delivery.
Before the machine can be used, various parts and supplied accessories must be unpacked and assembled.
TIP In addition to the assembly instructions, use the parts book to locate the parts and their positions on the machine.

Use sturdy hoisting equipment
Use the hoisting points on the machine to hook up your approved slings or hoisting chains. If the machine is hoisted incorrectly or with inferior equipment it could fall from the sling, resulting in material damage and possible physical injury.
Work on a clean surface
Before you start mounting, you should clean the surface and the directly surrounding area where you place the machine. A machine that is placed on pieces of packaging or parts, may slide away during mounting with material damage and possibly physical injury as a result.
Accessories and parts must be correctly mounted
Assemble accessories and parts according to specifications and attach them only for their designated purpose; ensure that it is locked correctly. Accessories and parts which are not fastened securely could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.
Tighten all bolts and nuts
Check that all the nuts and bolts are well set. Check this again after one hour of use
· after delivery and
· after maintenance or repairs have been carried out.
Never check holes to be lined up by inserting your fingers
Use a pin. Movement of the machine or parts may cause severe physical injury.<|begin_of_text|>

Before first use
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while mounting the spreader. Work carefully:
· place the machine on adequate supports,
· switching off the PTO shaft,
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· Switch off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury!
In addition to these assembly instructions, use the parts book to locate the parts and their positions on the machine or the tractor.
If you use the IsoMatch or another loose-standing control box to operate the spreader, you must first assemble the support.
The fixing materials and the assembly instructions are delivered with the control box. Additionally, you will find brief assembly instructions below.
If you use the IsoMatch or another loose-standing ISO-control box with a tractor equipped with the ISOBUS communication system, you can connect it with the supplied 7 points CAN cable to a standard tractor CAN connection.
 Connect the side of the cable to which 1 plug is attached to the tractor CAN connection.
 Connect the side of the cable to which 2 plugs are attached to both control box connections.
