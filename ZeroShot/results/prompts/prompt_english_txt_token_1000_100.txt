INDICATION
If you open the filters, you should block them to prevent unwanted closing.
 Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Open the sieves with the included attachment and deposit it.
 Remove the agitator from the agitator axle.
 Check if the distance between the agitator axle and the seal ring is the same on all sides.
If the distance is not equal all over the position of the dosing plate can be changed with regards to the agitator axle.
 Remove the dashboard by loosening the 3 fixing knobs.
 Turn the nuts on the 4 fastening bolts with which the dosing mechanism is attached to the hopper a few times to loosen them.
 Move the dosing plate so that the distance between the agitator axle and the seal ring is the same on all sides.
 Fasten the nuts on the 4 fastening bolts again without moving the dosing plates again.
 Put the agitator back on.
 Reattach the dashboard with the three fixing knobs.
 Check the connections as described in

Maintenance
It is necessary to set the dosing plates to the correct positions to each other to ensure correct dosing. If the dosing openings do not close well you will loose unnecessary fertiliser and the application rate will be higher than intended with a specific dosing setting. If the baffles slide far over each other the application rate will be much lower than expected.
If the dosing plates are mounted in the correct positions, you will see a small crack of light when the dosing openings are closed.
 Close the spreader dosing units on the control box. The actuators must be closed properly.
 Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Open the sieves with the included attachment and deposit it.
 Check if you can see a small crack between the dosing baffles.
 If not, move the actuator attachment point on the dosing mechanism until a small chink is visible between the dosing plates.
 Start the tractor and open and close the dosing units by operating the start and stop keys a few times.
 Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Check if you can see a small crack between the dosing baffles.
