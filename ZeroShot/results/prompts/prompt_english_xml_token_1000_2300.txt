During border spreading, the control system does not perform any automatic calibration, so it cannot accurately determine the correct dosing setting for the required application rate. Consequently, the application rate can deviate from the required application rate during border spreading. By spreading the field first, the control system can determine the correct dosing setting and thus spread at the correct application rate, also during border spreading.</text></page><|begin_of_text|><page number="107"><text>One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate</text><text>Operation</text><image /><text>Use in the field</text><text>Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules with the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra).
