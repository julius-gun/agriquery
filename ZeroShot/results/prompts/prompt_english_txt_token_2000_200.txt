One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate
Operation
[Image]
Use in the field
Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules with the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra). The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra).
Direction ( 1 ) (environmental set- ting)
Spread less to the field edge.
This will decrease the loss over the field edge, but the cover will not be as good
Direction ( 9 ) (yield setting)
Spread more to the field edge.
Cover is better, but the loss is greater
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test if the border spreading plate (optional extra) door de test therefore always before hand as described in
 paragraph »Testing the spreading pattern of the hydraulic border spreading plate« on page 84.

Procedure with hydraulic border spreading plate
[Image]
[Image]
108
Left and right border spreading is possible with the hydraulic border spreading plate.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Lower the border plate.
 Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!
 Adjust the spreader based on the details given in the spreading chart for the desired working width. Use the same settings and coupling shaft mounting point as with full field spreading,
 See also paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Start the tractor again.
 Switch the control box on.
 Engage the PTO shaft. The correct rpm of the spreading discs is the value of the relevant spreading chart.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
The control system will drive the dosing units in such a way that the actual application rate is equal to the set application rate through the lower PTO shaft RPM.
In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:
 Stop spreading immediately!
 Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!
 See then paragraph »Failure and stoppage« on page 113.
After border spreading:
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Close the dosing.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.<|begin_of_text|>

Driving pattern
Use in the field
Two different driving patterns can be used, depending on the situation on your land.
Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic border spreading plate, but disconnect the right spreading disc and close the dosing unit,
 see the methods above.
 Increase the PTO shaft rpm to 100% again.
 Drive down the second path in the first sprayer tramline.
 After the second operation, link up the right spreading disc drive again.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B):
 Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.
 Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic spreading plate.
 Reconnect the drive of the right spreading disc.
 Open the dosing unit of the right spreading disc.
 Drive up the second line 1 working width from the field edge (X metres). Maintain the distance with the field edge carefully by using pickets, for instance.

Boundary track spreading with ExactLine

INDICATION
[Image]
[Image]
Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) (=first sprayer tramline) when doing boundary track spreading with the ExactLine (accessory). The flow of fertiliser granules, seeds or other granules spread with ExactLine. The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the ExactLine position.
The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test the ExactLine therefore always in advance as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The (online) spreading charts indicate the correct setting for the ExactLine and the relevant rpm for the PTO shaft and the spreading discs.
If the settings of the ExactLine are not given in the relevant spreading chart they can be obtained in the following sources:
· find with the online spreading chart service on the website or via the Free Application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
 See paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
Always check the settings of the ExactLine by performing the test as described in
 paragraph »Testing ExactLine spreading pattern« on page 89.
The type of fertiliser is determined when adjusting the spreader, as described in
 paragraph »Determine the type and pattern of the granules« on page 57.
you can choose from 3 settings from the chart:
· YIELD.
· ECO,
In the yield setting (YIELD), the loss over the field edge is higher than what is allowed by the environmental standard. Therefore, never use this setting next to surface water. Cover to the border is very good with this option.
The loss over the field edge will be equal to or less than the environment standard in the environment setting (ECO). Always use this setting when working next to a surface water! The result is that the cover at the border of the property is not optimum.

Use in the field
 Engage the ExactLine by letting the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve run for a few seconds. This is also how pressure is built in the accumulator. You will see the ExactLine symbol on the main screen. The symbol only appears when the ExactLine is in working position.
 Close the tap on the hydraulic hose to prevent the ExactLine from changing position while spreading due to a leaking tractor valve.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Do not change the settings of the spreader.
 See paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
 Set the ExactLine to the required position, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart.
 Start the tractor and set the correct PTO shaft and spreading discs RPM, based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart or the chart on the previous page.
 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.
 Continue operating the spreader in the same way as in full field spreading,
 See paragraph »Start spreading« on page 100.
 Check regularly while spreading to see if the symbol of the ExactLine remains on screen. If the symbol disappears the ExactLine is no longer in a good working position.
 Set the ExactLine back to transport mode after use by opening the tap in the hydraulic hose and then opening the relevant single-acting hydraulic valve for a few seconds.
The ExactLine's position is displayed on the main screen if you have connected this function.
 See the software instruction manual.
