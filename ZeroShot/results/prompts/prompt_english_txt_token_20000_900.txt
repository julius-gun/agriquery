     crop from being damaged while spreading.
The spreader is provided with 12 vanes of equal length and 4 shorter.
 Grease the threaded rods of the vanes.
 Hook the short vanes into the correct position (see illustration).
 Then place the other two vanes into the other positions.
 Press the vanes in well and put the lock nut in position.
 Place the vanes on the other side in the same manner.
 Fasten the lock nuts (50NM)
Even wear of the vanes
The long vanes are positioned in groups of three.
The first vane considered in the direction of rotation of the disc will wear out most quickly.
TIP  Exchange the first vane after the fixed vane, and the short vane, over a period of time.
 After a subsequent period, exchange the foremost vane at that time with the central vane.
As a result, the vanes will wear evenly and the spreading pattern will remain optimal.

The coupling shaft provided is too long for most types of tractors
The coupling shaft must be cut to the correct length before connecting it to the tractor. A coupling shaft that is too long could lead to serious damage to the machine and the tractor.
 See the paragraph »Checking the coupling shaft length« below
 and the below paragraph »Shortening the coupling shaft«.
During lifting and lowering of the power lift, the coupling shaft requires adequate space for:
· sliding in and out,
· sufficient overlap between the profiled tubes when driving the machine in the extreme operating angle of the coupling shaft.
Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine
This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.
The length of the coupling shaft and the shortening thereof must be done after the power lift has been connected, but before the coupling shaft has been connected.
 Lift the machine with the power lift until the PTO shaft and the machine drive axle are level.
This is the shortest possible length between the two shafts.
 Place the machine on a supporting beam.
 Switch the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the coupling shaft for it to be two halves.
 Mount the loose tractor section of the coupling shaft to the tractor PTO shaft.
 Attach the loose machine component of the coupling shaft to the drive axle.
 Manually align the two coupling shaft halves.
 Check the length and adjust it as described below.<|begin_of_text|>

Before first use
The profiled tubes must overlap as far as possible, with a minimum of 150 mm.
The profiled tubes must however have at least 25 mm free clearance at the outer edges when the tractor PTO shaft and the machine drive axle are level.
 Cut off the two profiled tubes to achieve the 25 mm clearance.
 Deburr both ends.
 Clean the coupling shaft.
 Shorten the protection sleeves by the same length.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Connect the coupling shaft of the machine and the tractor.
 Lift the machine with the power lift in the highest operating position.
Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine
This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.
The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30 ° when lifted and 30 ° when lowered.This is the maximum length between the PTO shaft and the machine drive axle.
 Place the machine on a supporting beam wit the power lift in the highest position.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Check if the furthest working angle is less than 30 °.
 Check that the overlap of the profiled tubes is still at least 150 mm.
 Remove the tractor section.
 Apply grease to the profiled tubes.
 Attach the protection sleeves.
 Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.
 Mount the coupling shaft to the machine.
Always mount the check chains of the protection sleeves
The check chains prevent the protection sleeves from rotating with the coupling shaft. Crop or pieces of clothing can be wound around rotating protection sleeves and cause material damage and possibly severe physical injury.
 Mount the check chains to both outer edges of the coupling shaft protective sleeves.
 Mount the other ends of the chains to a fixed point of the tractor and machine respectively. System settings

Neutralise the controls
Control devices, e.g. ropes, hoses, etc. for remote actuation of devices such as cylinders, shall be guided and positioned in a way they never inadvertently release nor block desired movements/actuations! Unintentional movements can lead to serious injury.
Connecting and disconnecting safely
There are risks of injury involved in connecting and disconnecting the machine. Work carefully:
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· a mobile machine must also be protected from rolling away while being connected,
· the machine should only be connected and disconnected from the tractor on a firm, dry and flat surface so that the machine would not tilt and/or sink into the ground,
· ensure no other people are in the immediate vicinity of the tractor or the machine,
· work in accordance with the guidelines provided in this user's manual
· a power lift that conforms with the regulations must be used,
· never stand between the tractor and machine while the power lift is operated externally while connecting or disconnecting the machine,
· the machine must only be connected to the points intended for that purpose,
· the machine must only be connected or disconnected while the PTO shaft is off,
· check the state of the machine in order to ensure that it can safely be operated and transported.
Connecting or disconnecting the machine in an unsafe manner could lead to serious personal injury and damage to the machine.
Always mount the check chains of the protection sleeves
The check chains prevent the protection sleeves from rotating with the coupling shaft. Crop or pieces of clothing can be wound around rotating protection sleeves and cause material damage and possibly severe physical injury.
Check the coupling shaft
Check the following points before the PTO shaft is attached. Has the coupling shaft:
· no damage, including the protection sleeves?
· are there sufficient lubricants as prescribed?
· is the prescribed overlap of the coupling shaft halves and protection sleeves, both in transport and in operating position?
· Are the protection sleeves attached with chains to a fixed point to guard against turning?
An unsafe or improperly mounted coupling shaft could lead to serious or deadly injury.
If the coupling shaft does not comply with the points mentioned above, it must be replaced before using the machine.

Connecting to the tractor
There is an option of two tension levels, depending on the height of the crop. The high hitch points are for normal use, the low hitch points are used if the maximum lifting height of the tractor is not sufficient to ensure that the spreading height is 75 cm above the crop.
The low hitch points are also used when fertilising high crops, which is known as top dressing.
For further adjustments with top dressing, see
 paragraph »Spreading height« on page 95.
The space between the spreader and the tractor is limited as far as possible in order to keep the centre of gravity as closely to the tractor as possible. This promotes stability and the road behaviour of the tractor. As a result the coupling shaft, hydraulic hoses and electric plugs must be connected first, followed by the power lift.
 Move the tractor to the front of the spreader so that the catch hooks of the power lift are around 200 mm from the spreader (the maximum distance depends on the reach of the coupling shaft; the halves must always overlap each other).
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system of the tractor.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Put the lower links of the tractor level with the machine linkage pins.
 Compensate for any height difference with the lift rod adjustment of the power lift.
 Adjust the stabiliser chains to make lateral movement of the lower links impossible.
 Mount the appropriate ball bearings to the linkage pins and the top.
 Secure the linkage pins and top again.
Only connect the machine to the front power lift if:
· it has sufficient lifting power,
· it falls within the same fixing category as the machine,
· with linkage frame (optional extras) for tractors with power lift of Cat. 3 / 4,
· the minimum and maximum load of the front and rear weight would not be exceeded,
· the tractor has a closed cabin and proper air filters (active carbon filters).

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
The data for the correct setting of your spreader can be found in the spreading charts in the spreading chart book and the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.
 See also paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.
The spreading charts indicate what type of fertiliser is best suited to achieving a good distribution. Correct adjustment depends on the characteristics of the fertiliser, not the brand! Determine the characteristics of the fertiliser, therefore, and find the spreading chart with similar features. Use the chart, even if the brand of the fertiliser differs from the nearest comparable fertiliser!
Select the spreading chart based on the characteristics of the fertiliser and not on the brand!
In order to find the correct spreading chart in the spreading chart book, online spreading chart service on the website, or via the free application (App) on your mobile phones, you must collect the following physical properties of the fertiliser
· type and pattern of the granules
 see the paragraph below,»Determine the type and pattern of the granules«
· distribution (= composition of granules of various sizes),
 see paragraph »Determining distribution« on page 59,
· similar weight,
 See paragraph »Determining similar weight« on page 60.
Distribution is the most vital characteristic of the fertiliser when it comes to spreading. You can make the first selection from the (online) spreading charts based on the distribution. Never use a spreading chart for another type of fertiliser, even if the distribution is very similar! You can determine which spreading chart compares the best to the fertiliser you are using based on similar weight.
Select the type of fertiliser from the spreading chart that is closest to the type of fertiliser that you are using.
The characteristics of the various types of fertiliser are so far reaching that using a spreading chart for another type of fertiliser, even if the distribution is the same, could provide a bad spreading pattern and could harm the crop!

Determining distribution
[Image]
[Image]
[Image]
[Image]
[Image]
To be done before spreading
The distribution is the ratio of granules with different diameters. A distribution meter comes with every spreader. This meter has 4 sections, with seven parts. The seven have different mesh width that divide the fertiliser granules, based on their diameters.
Distribution of 0-70-30-0 indicates none of the granules has a diameter of less than 2.0 mm, 70% have a diameter between 2.0 - 3.3 mm, 30% have a diameter between 3.3 - 4.75 mm and none is larger than 4.75 mm.
You should therefore do the following to determine the distribution of the fertiliser with the distribution meter:
 Fill the slot that reads 4.75 mm and close the other openings with the cover.
 Close the distribution meter with the cover and keep it on its side.
 Shake it for as long as no more smaller granules are falling through the sieves.
 Turn the distribution meter back up and read the content of each slot. The given percentages should add up to 100%. It could be necessary to round the readings off with small and round granules.
 Repeat the steps above three times and then determine the average distribution.
TIP Fill the fraction meter from another part of the hopper in order to obtain a good average as the larger granules tend to roll to the outer part of the hopper.
TIP Clean the seven parts regularly in order to prevent them from getting blocked.
[Image]
The last figure indicates how you can read the following distribution: 0-70-30-0
Indication with regard to the distribution:
· If the diameter of 10% or more of the fertiliser granules is smaller than 2.0 mm the fertiliser type would be difficult to spread, especially with large working widths. This could result in a less than optimal distribution and could damage the crops.
· If the diameter of 80 - 100% of the fertiliser granules is between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertiliser would be good to spread, irrespective of the size of the remaining granules.
· If the diameter of 20% or more of the fertiliser granules is greater than 4.75 mm it would be difficult for optimum distribution. This could lead to damage to the crops as the granules could make holes in the leaves of the crop.

Determining similar weight
[Image]
Finding the correct spreading chart
60
The density is the weight (kg) of 1 litre of fertiliser and it is expressed as kg/litre or ton/m3.
The following material is required to determine the density:
· measuring beaker (supplied),
· scale (supplied).
 Refer to the scale manual.
Working method to determine similar weight:
 Hang the empty and dry measuring beaker on the scale.
 Press the scale to 0.
 Fill the measuring beaker.
 Knock the measuring beaker 5 times on firm ground.
 Fill up the measuring beaker.
 Weigh the fertiliser.
 Repeat the steps above three times in order to determine the average weight.
Density of at least 1 kg/l is desirable for a good distribution of the fertiliser. Lighter types of fertiliser would be more difficult to spread and the maximum working width would be limited.

To be done before spreading
Information about the settings of the spreader can be found in the
spreading chart book, but also via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system. This will also provide information about additional types of fertiliser that have been tested recently. You can make use of the online spreading chart service as an alternative to the spreading chart book. You must enter the characteristics of the fertiliser, your working width, application rate, driving speed and the type of fertiliser. You will then receive advice from the website for setting your spreader: dosing setting, discharge point, flowrate, vane combination and angle of the spreader.
Methods for adjusting the spreader can be found at:  chapter »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
Also check the advice given on the online spreading chart service. Do a calibration test to check the dosing setting. Then check the spreading pattern with a tray test.
 See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.
You can reach the spreading chart service as follows:
 Go to the website of the Kverneland Group: http://www.Kvernelandspreadingcharts.com.
 The various languages are given at the top of the page.
 Start the spreading chart service and complete the details required.
 The spreading chart service will then request that you select a product with comparable characteristics.
 The spreading chart service will then indicate the settings for your spreader. Follow the working methods as described in
 paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.
AutosetApp gives you the option to download these spreading charts to the IsoMatch Tellus terminal in order to set the spreader automatically. After choosing the desired fertiliser type, the working width, application rate, driving speed, dosing and discharge opening are transmitted to the spreader using the AutosetApp. The spreader then automatically gets the correct setting. Automatic adjustment of the discharge point only applies to GEOSPREAD spreaders. The same data may be transmitted to the spreader via the AutosetApp for the other weighing spreader models such as Exacta-CL EW and Exacta-TL(X). Except for the discharge opening, the spreader then has to be set manually.
Using the Kverneland Group spreading charts application, you can easily find the right settings for your spreader.
The spreading charts application gives you immediate access to the most up-to-date test results of fertiliser.
In just a few steps, the application will lead you to the correct settings for your spreader, any time of the day, wherever you want for almost any type of fertiliser.
The spreading chart application (App) can be downloaded free of charge through the Apple App Store and/or through the Google Play Store.

Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with the materials could lead to personal injury.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully while making adjustments:
· switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with filling, adjusting or testing,
· Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured spreader,
· Comply carefully with the instructions.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
Set the spreader based on the details obtained from the correct spreading chart, the desired application rate (kg/ha) and the driving speed (km/h).
You can find the methods for determining the correct spreading chart in
 the instruction manual of the software.
The spreading chart page contains information about the fertiliser to which this chart relates. Here you will also find the settings you need to perform in respect of your spreader:<|begin_of_text|>

Working width
The working width must be selected to set the spreader. This could for instance be the distance between the sprayer tramlines.
In the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system, look for the page that shows the desired working width of the fertiliser type with the most similar properties.
Various types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.
If you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres. Enter the actual working width into the control system so that the selected application rate is correctly distributed.
The working width is adjusted with:
· the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and
· the discharge point.
The working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox. Which terminal (turtle or hare) you need to use is listed in the (online) spreading chart and depends on the desired working width.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Detach the coupling shaft from the machine.
 Attach the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point.

It is necessary to correctly set the discharge point in order to obtain a good spreading pattern and the correct working width. The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.
The discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point, of the spreading chart.
Always check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).
 see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.
In the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.
You can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.
TIP Set the spreader angle before you fill the hopper. It is easier to adjust the top link if the hopper is empty.
Check the position again after the hopper has been filled!
If the inclination is at 4 o of 8 o, the spreader area slides further behind the spreader.
 In the machine data screen, increase the length B by 10% or 20% at 4 o or 8 o.
 Please refer to the software instruction manual for the procedure.
The (online) spreading chart shows the rpm of the spreading discs as well as the rpm of the PTO shaft. The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.
The PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones. Use the connection point shown in the spreading chart.

Application rate
Constant application rate
[Image]
[Image]
[Image]
The control system can drive the spreader in three different ways:
· distribution that resembles the settings for the preset application rate must be determined under changing circumstances through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,
 see the paragraph below,»Constant application rate«.
with similar or lower application rates (< 40 kg/min) the fine application kit should be used,
 See paragraph »Fine application« on page 67.
· with very low application rates on very uneven terrain, preset application rates must be checked manually to ensure that the correct dosing setting is being distributed, without automatic calibration but with driving speed correction,
· under changing circumstances location specific application rate driven by an external signal, through automatic calibration and driving speed correction,
 See paragraph »Variable, externally driven application rate« on page 72.
The control system can spread an equal amount of fertiliser over the entire field. In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.
The control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.
 See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.
Look for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:
 Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.
 The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.
 The given values are to be entered in the control system.
If the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate. If the selected driving speed is not given, use the settings closest to the selected driving speed.

To be done before spreading
All three dosing openings normally open uniformly with the selected application rate and the corresponding flowrate that you set. With a low application rate and/or a low driving speed the dosing openings are only opened a slight bit so that very little fertiliser would stream through the dosing openings of the spreader. This could easily cause blockage, which would lead to a bad spreading pattern and possible damage the crops.
We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.
The flowrate with a specific working width, application rate and driving speed is given in the fourth column of the spreading chart.
If very low application rates (less than 25 kg/ha) are to be distributed, e.g. only a few kilograms per hectare, the control system cannot perform automatic calibrations. The distributed weight is too small to accurately adjust the application rate.
Close 2 of the 3 dosing openings to prevent blockages. The remaining opening must be further opened as the application rate with the constant flowrate would be three times as much.
The handle to close 2 of the 3 fine dosing openings is located at the outside of the spreading disc, above a similar handle for the discharge point. You will find the indications on top of the fine application handle for the number of dosing openings: 3 open holes for standard dosing and 1 open hole and 2 thick holes for fine application.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Pull the hand-grip of the fine application lever out.
 Set the fine application handle until the arrow on the hand-grip indicates the desired position.
 Let go of the hand-grip and check if the fine application handle is locked.
 Set the fine application lever on the other spreading disc in the same way to the same position.

The dosing setting to be set can be:
· Read from the relevant spreading chart when you want to spread at a lower application rate using the fine application kit and the symbol of the Fine application kit is indicated in the spreading chart. This is indicated by means of 1 open hole (dosing opening).
· Determine an application rate not given as described in paragraph »Discharge point«from page 65.
· To be calculated using the relevant spreading chart when you wish to spread at a lower application rate with the fine application kit, and the Fine application kit symbol is indicated in the spreading chart; it is indicated using 3 open holes (dosage opening).
Calculation
As 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed the flowrate of the remaining dosing opening should be three times as much in order to obtain an even application rate.
 Read the Dosing Setting, Discharge Point and Flowrate from the spreading chart. Calculate the flowrate with the formula given below as required.
If the selected application rate or driving speed is not indicated in the spreading chart the required flowrate can also be calculated as follows:
flowrate required (kg/min) =
Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)
600
Use the letter given for setting the discharge point in the line of the spreading chart that most closely resembling the calculated flowrate.
 Multiply the flowrate (given in the Kg/min column or calculated) with a factor of 3.
 Select the closest flowrate for the whole spreader in the Kg/min column.
 Read off the relevant dosing setting or estimate it as closely as possible.

To be done before spreading
[Image]
Suppose you would want to spread Nutramon from the example with the features as given in the spreading chart on this page: With a working width of 27 metres, a driving speed of 8 km/h and a se-
lected application rate of 25 kg/ha.
The required application rate falls beyond the scope of the spreading chart.
 Calculate the required flowrate.
27 (m) x 8 (km/h) x 25 (kg/ha)
600 flowrate required (kg/min) =
Result: flowrate required = 9 kg/min.
 Set the discharge point as indicated in the chart: J.
 Calculate the required flowrate with fine application: 3 x 9 = 27 kg/ min.
 This value is in the dosing setting: 18+3 (= 21).
 Do a manual calibration test to check the flowrate setting.

PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
You can check with a manual calibration test if the preset dosing setting reaches the selected flowrate.
The calibration test is normally performed on the left spreading disc. Perform the calibration test with a filled hopper.  See also paragraph »Filling« on page 73.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Remove the vanes from the left spreading disc.
 Connect the coupling shaft to the coupling point on the machine shown in the relevant spreading chart.
 See also paragraph »Coupling shaft connection point« on page 64.
 Mount the calibration container carefully on the left spreading disc.
 Set the calibration container with the settings knob so that the spreading disc does not touch the calibration container.

RS 232 connection
72
The control system provides the options to distribute the same application rate all over the field and the option to spread a variable, externally driven application rate. This provides the option to spread as per requirements, e.g. through a nitrogen sensor.
An application rate that had been preset in the corresponding management system for the relevant field can also be entered through the GPS system.
 For the options and corresponding settings, see the user's manuals for the external system and the control box, e.g. the IsoMatch. The control system of the spreader in combination with the IsoMatch control box also transmits the application rate and working width used back to the external system.
The external system and the control system of a spreader with an IsoMatch control box communicate through a serial port with an RS 232 connection. This connection is located at the back of the control box. The occupation of pins in the 9-point RS 232 plug and the settings required are given in

Filling
[Image]
To be done before spreading
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You could come into contact with materials when filling the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Chemical reactions caused by mixing fertilisers
Mixing different types of fertiliser could lead to a chemical reaction whereby poisonous vapours, liquids or other materials could come about. Possible danger of explosion! This could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.
Only mix different types of fertiliser if allowed by the manufacturer(s).
Chemical reactions could lead to damage to the machines and personal injury.
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier
Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and apply that. Protective clothing should be worn when necessary.
Disregarding the safety instructions could result in personal injury and damage to the machine.
Use proper tools
Great volumes of material is often handled during the filling process. Use proper tools such as lifting devices when moving and filling the machine. Keep legislation concerning working conditions in mind. Work carefully and responsibly. Inferior tools can cause serious inju-
ries.
Only fill mounted machines
Never place a machine in the ground while filling it. Always keep it in the power lift of the tractor. The machine is designed to be loaded while in a suspended state. Never park a filled machine on the ground. Filling the machine while it is on the ground could lead to damage.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
73<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 74===

To be done before spreading
INDICATION
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
You can fill the spreader to the desired levels after it has been put in place. It is recommended that the machine be loaded while it is lifted 10 cm above the soil. If no activities need to be performed on top of the hopper, the height can be adjusted with the automatic filling system.
A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in
 paragraph »Technical specifications« on page 36.
 If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.
 Lower the machine at the desired level. The machine must not rest on the ground, but rather be lifted a minimum distance of 10 cm!
 Check if the dosing units are closed. Close them if necessary by pressing the stop key on the main screen.
The position of the dosing units is displayed in the main screen on the control box of the control system.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Place wheel chocks in front of the wheels of the tractor.
 If a mobile loading platform is being used, place the loading platform at the spreader so that there would be a maximum distance of 200 mm between the two.
 Open the hopper cover.
 Check if the sieve is closed and secured.
 Fill the machine to the desired level with the correct tools. Fill the hopper halves to the same level so that the both of them would run empty at the same time.

===Page 75===

INDICATION
To be done before spreading
Work carefully while filling and take the regulations that apply to working conditions into consideration! Make sure no objects or tools fall into the hopper. as it could block or damage the spreader!
 Close the hopper cover.
Do not exceed the maximum recommended weight!  See also »Technical specifications« on page 36. The machine has not been constructed to carry the additional weight. Keep the axle load, load capacity of the wheels and the total weight of the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted
machines« on page 13.
INDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.
INDICATION
If the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.

Spreading pattern check (tray test)
76
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
You will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
The test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!
Dangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.
A tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.
Tray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.
We recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.
[Image]<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 77===

[Image]
INDICATION
To be done before spreading
When to perform the tray test:
· When using a fertiliser type that is not in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using a fertiliser type of which the distribution and density deviate from the values indicated in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system.
· When using fertiliser of moderate quality.
· Test should be carried out annually on the left and the right side to check the equal distribution of both spreading discs.
· After each change to the spreading mechanism of the spreader or when parts are replaced.
Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test. The tray test should be performed with dry weather, low humidity and with a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2).
Material required
· measuring tape or ruler,
· spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
· 7 troughs,
· 7 graduated tubes,
· 1 funnel,
· notebook, pen and calculator,
· this manual.
· the instruction manual of the software.
General instructions
 Check the preset dosing setting and the discharge point.
 Check the height (75 cm above the troughs) and the position (angle) of the spreader.
 Check the rpm of the PTO shaft and the spreader discs.
 Always place the buckets horizontally on the floor.
 Place the buckets at a maximum distance of 4 metres. Provide additional widths for testing widths of more than 24 meters. Also, you can first test part of the working width and then empty the trays and distribute them over the rest of the working width.
 Do not use the spreader while it is raining or with high humidity. This will cause the fertiliser to cling to the troughs, which would not provide the desired results.
 Do not spread with wind speeds of more than 3 m/s (wind force of 2).

Test the left and right spreading patterns
INDICATION
[Image]
The left and right spreading discs must spread the same volumes of fertiliser to ensure good distribution. Check this every year!
This test describes a working width of 24 metres. You are of course free to run the test for a different working width. Divide the buckets at equal distances along the working width.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the left spreading disc by sliding the connector to he left. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Search the correct discharge position to spread over 24 metres in the best comparable fertiliser, seeds or granules (online) spreading chart and set the handle accordingly.
 See paragraph »Discharge point« on page 65 and the foreword of the spreading chart book.
 Fit the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point of the central gearbox as indicated in the associated spreading chart.
 See paragraph »Coupling shaft connection point« on page 64.
 Check the height of the spreader (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
 Place the other troughs 4 metres to the right of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
78<|begin_of_text|>
===Page 79===

[Image]
To be done before spreading
 Start the tractor again.
 Close all the doors and windows in the cabin.
 Switch the control box on.
 Enter the required application rate.
 Enter the working width.
It is recommended that an application rate of at least 250 kg/ha is entered with the selected driving speed.
 Switch on the left spreading disc.
 Switch off the automatic calibration.
 Engage the PTO shaft and set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 Open the right dosing unit.
 Drive over the first trough and stop only after you have driven at least 20 metres past this trough. This is because the spreader distributes roughly even to the back, front and to the side.
 Close the dosing unit.
 Empty the trough with a funnel into the graduated tubes and record the reading in your notebook.
Repeat the above procedure, but disconnect the right spreading disc and switch the dosing unit of the right spreading disc off. Put the troughs on the left side of the tractor track.
Drive with the same speed and with the same PTO shaft rpm as with the first time!

Assessment
 Record the values you find in the graduated tubes for the left and right spreading discs.
 Compare the values, calculate the percentage differences between the measuring tubes on the left and the right.
Adaptation
If the spreading patterns on the left and right spreading discs are not the same and the difference is greater than 3% you will have to do the following, or request your dealer to do so:
 Check if the machine is hanging horizontally and vertically behind the tractor in length and width.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the dosing mechanism« as described on page 133 and repeat the test.
 Perform the »Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism« as described on page 136 and repeat the test.
If the difference in the spreading pattern is too great, contact your dealer.

If the spreader is correctly set and the tramlines are set at the correct distance from each other you would achieve a good distribution of fertiliser over the land. This will only be achieved if the spreader spreads with the correct spreading pattern.
This is then the reason why you have to test the spreading pattern and adjust it as required.
 See also paragraph »Full field spreading pattern« on page 28.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width (X metre) that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place the grids in the troughs.
 Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!
 Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.
The actual width is twice the size of the effective working width!
If you want to spread over a working width of 24 metres, place the buckets at 24/6 metres = 4 metres.

 Enter the working width.
It is recommended that an application rate of at least 250 kg/ha is entered with the selected driving speed.
 Switch off the automatic calibration.
 Engage the PTO shaft and set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 Drive along the tracks and open the dosing units a few metres before you drive over the first bucket in the middle by pressing the start key.
 Only stop spreading after you have driven at least one working width over the troughs (e.g. 18 or 24 metres). This is because the spreader distributes roughly even to the back, front and to the side.
 Close the dosing units.
 Drive back in the next track, over trough 7. Maintain the same distance with opening and closing the dosing units. Keep to the same driving speed and PTO shaft rpm!
 If you set an application rate of less than 250 kg/ha, drive to and from over the same tracks in order to collect sufficient fertiliser in the troughs for a good comparison.
Maintain the same distance with opening and closing the dosing units. Keep to the same driving speed and PTO shaft rpm!

When using the border spreading plate the aim is to obtain maximum distribution to the border with minimum loss in the ditch.
This is then why the border spreading plate has to be tested. Do not perform this test next to the ditch, rather mark a line behind which the fictive ditch will be.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right or left spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right or left. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Close the dosing unit of the right or left spreading disc.
INDICATION Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!

Reducing the PTO shaft rpm and closing the right spreading disc also have an influence on the spreading pattern on the left side of the spreader. The full field spreading pattern should therefore be tested when using the border spreading plate.
Follow the instructions, adjusted for border spreading, as described in  paragraph »Full field spreading pattern test« on page 81.
Operation
 Do not change the position of the border spreading plate and disconnect the right or left spreading disc.
With the first time:
 Do not change the settings of the spreader, the PTO shaft rpm or the driving speed as these should be the same as settings for border spreading.
With the second time:
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Set the spreader for full field spreading.
 Set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 The driving speed and PTO shaft rpm must be the same as the first time.
Assessment
The middle buckets could contain less application rate. The pattern on illustration B from
 paragraph »Full field spreading pattern test« on page 81.
This is because of the lower PTO shaft rpm.
The level of the middle measuring tube in border spreading could be 25% lower than with the outer graduated tubes.
Adaptation
If the difference is more than 25%:
 Increase the spreading disc rpm by 50 rpm.
 Perform the full field spreading pattern test with the adjustments for border spreading again until the deviation is less than 25%.
 Perform the spreading pattern test of the border spreading plate anew. Adjust the position of the border spreading plate until the loss is below the legal requirements.

This is why the ExactLine has to be tested. Do not perform this test next to the ditch, rather mark a line behind which the fictive ditch will be.
Operation
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Allow the hydraulic valve to run a few seconds to bring the ExactLine to working condition and to put good pressure in the accumulator.
 Close the taps in the hydraulic hose to prevent the ExactLine from ending up in a different position by accident.

Observe the permissible and safe height with regard to
· prescribed maximum height for vehicles in the road traffic regulations,
· high-voltage cables or other cables over the road;
· anticipated maximum headroom.
Pay close attention to these aspects to prevent dangerous situations that could lead to major material damage and possibly to serious physical injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check whether the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (<40km/h) on your tractor, is hidden by the implement.
 Then fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.
 Check the run of the quick coupling ropes of the power lift.
