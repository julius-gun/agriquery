 Examine the spreading discs and the discharge opening to see what the cause of the failure/stoppage is.
 Adapt the discharge point as needed for easier access.
 If you still cannot see the cause, carefully remove the vanes to see better into the discharge opening of the discharge bushing.
 Pass an object such as a screwdriver through the discharge opening and carefully feel if you can find an object in or damage to the dosing openings or agitator.
If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The agitator is probably damaged too. You must first repair the damage or have it repaired before continuing with spreading.
 Place an object, for example a cloth or bag, in the discharge opening of the discharge bushing on the damaged side.. This will prevent you from wasting fertiliser during transport.
 Start the tractor and engage the control box. The dosing units will now close.
 Switch off the control box.
 Take all appropriate measures for road transport.
 See paragraph »Preparing the machine to be transported« on page 93.
On the site of a lockable storage depot:
 Empty the hopper without positioning the machine on the ground.
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
Lock the sieve in the open position
If you open the sieves, you should lock them to prevent unwanted closing. Accidental closure could lead to serious injury.
 Remove the object that caused the damage.
 Repair the machine or have your dealer do it.

If you have not found any damage, the failure is probably due to stoppage from an encrusted layer of fertiliser.
 Try to reduce the size of the lump or encrusted layer with an object such as a stick, screwdriver or vane.
If you open the filters to reduce the lump or encrusted layer from the top side, you should block them to prevent unwanted closing.
If you can reduce the lump or encrusted layer in this way:
 Inspect the hopper contents for other lumps and reduce them.
 Fit the vanes and secure them with the lock nut.
 Check the discharge point setting.
 Close the hopper cover.
 Continue spreading.
If you have not managed to reduce the lump or encrusted layer because it is out of reach or there is no tool at your disposal:
 Close the hopper cover.
 Follow the working method as described in the previous paragraph »Damage« until emptying the hopper.
 Remove or reduce the lump or encrusted layer.
 If necessary, dry the hopper and the dosing mechanism.
Opening the sieve clip
 Open the sieve closure with an attachment, standard supplied with the machine.
 Lock the sieve to prevent it from closing accidentally.
 Close the sieves and check the lock.
 Refill the spreader.
 Check the fertiliser for lumps before and after filling.
 Close the hopper cover.<|begin_of_text|>

Storing the machine
Avoid contact with the fertiliser and other material
It is easy to come into contact with the materials when putting away the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!
Be careful that nothing gets jammed
It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader. Work safely with the machine:
· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switching off the electronic control system,
· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor,
· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you approach it,
· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,
· carefully follow the instructions given.
Friction with these materials could cause physical injury.
Protect the machine
Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan. After cleaning, inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with the supplied preserving liquid point for protection against corrosion of the
machine, read the instructions before use.
Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners
You can clean the machine with water or steam, possibly using only suitable cleaning tools. Also read here and adhere to the safety instructions of the material manufacturer.
 Only use low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.
 Keep the nozzle more than 30 cm clear of turning parts, sensors, parts of the electric system, hydraulic hoses, stickers and plastic parts.
 Only spray perpendicular to sticker edges.
Waste storage and disposal
The waste water from cleaning the machine is contaminated with fertiliser and possibly also with lubrications. Collect the waste and dispose of it in terms of national regulations.

Cleaning
118
It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.
The advantages of this working order are:
· additional checks on the machine right after work,
· ensuring the longevity of the machine,
· less delays due to problems while working with the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples.
 See paragraph »Lubricating points« on page 126.
 Clean the machine.
 Lubricate the machine grease nipples once again.
When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.
Furthermore, do not set up electrical components. Water can cause electrical failures.

Disconnecting the machine
[Image]
Storing the machine
Disconnect safely
You may only disconnect the machine when
· all parts are in a safe condition,
· your immediate vicinity is safe,
· the hopper is empty.
Work carefully:
· check the environment (children!) and ensure that nobody is in the vicinity of the tractor or the machine,
· wear safety gloves and shoes,
· the machine or parking support must only be placed on a straight, firm surface,
· never stand between the tractor and machine while the power lift is operated externally while disconnecting the machine. Using the power lift entails the risk of accidents by crushing or jack-knifing,
· operate the power lift slowly and carefully,
· the power lift during disconnection must be placed in such a position that accidental release or lowering would be eliminated,
· sufficient distance must be maintained between parts (e.g. parking support) that rest on the ground.
Working unsafely could cause serious injuries.
Proceed as follows to store the machine in stable condition for a shorter or longer period.
 Switch off the pto shaft.
 Check that the ExactLine hydraulic hose tap is closed.
 Check that the ExactLine hydraulic hose tap of the hydraulic border spreading plate is closed.
 Take the pressure off the hydraulic system.
 Place the machine on a stable, level base.
 Switch the electronic control system off.
 Engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Adjust the length of the top link in such a way that it is no longer live.
 Release the top link by undoing the release rope from the catch hooks and pulling the top link up.
 Release the lower links by undoing the release ropes from the catch hooks and lowering the power lift
