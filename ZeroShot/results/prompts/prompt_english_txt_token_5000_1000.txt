To be done before spreading
Testing the spreading pattern of the hydraulic border spreading plate
Always perform a calibration test first and determine the correct dosing setting before checking the spreading pattern. Changes to the dosing setting will also have an influence on the spreading pattern!  See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.

When using the border spreading plate the aim is to obtain maximum distribution to the border with minimum loss in the ditch.
This is then why the border spreading plate has to be tested. Do not perform this test next to the ditch, rather mark a line behind which the fictive ditch will be.
Operation
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Disconnect the right or left spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right or left. Secure the connector with a lock clip.
 Close the dosing unit of the right or left spreading disc.
INDICATION Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!
[Image]
 Set the spreader in accordance with the spreading chart for the desired working width and the instructions given in the 'One-sided boundary spreading" chapter (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Place 1 trough in the middle of the tractor tracks. The centre of the driving track must be 2 metres from the line behind which the fictive ditch is located.
INDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!

To be done before spreading
 Place 1 trough on the land next to the fictive border ditch and 2 troughs next to each other in the fictive ditch.
 Start the tractor and engage the PTO shaft. The correct PTO shaft rpm is the standard value, less 25%, being 540 rpm - 25% = 400 rpm.
 Select a gear that would ensure that you drive at the same speed as with the normal PTO shaft, or reduce the application rate by 25%.
 Start driving along the field edge. The distance between the border and the middle of the tractor must be 2 metres.
 Open the dosing unit a few metres before you get to the middle bucket.
 Only stop spreading after you have driven at least one working width over the troughs (e.g. 24 metres). This is because the spreader distributes roughly even to the back, front and to the side.
 If you set an application rate of less than 250 kg/ha, drive over the same tracks in order to collect sufficient fertiliser in the troughs for a good comparison.
Maintain the same distance with opening and closing the dosing unit. Keep to the same driving speed and PTO shaft rpm!
 Empty the troughs with a funnel into the graduated tubes.
A hydraulic border spreading plate is available for both sides.
 Lower the border spreading plate.
 Close the tap to prevent unintentional lifting of the plate while working.
 Close off the dosing on the side where no spreading is to be done.
 disconnect the drive of the plate on the side where no spreading is to be done.
 Set the plate using the (online) spreading chart.
Maintain the correct disc rpm when spreading.
Set the plate more in the direction of position 9 to spread more towards the edge.
Set the plate more in the direction of position 1 to spread less towards the edge.
The spreading chart shows settings for the yield and H2O positions; for the yield position use the standard mounted (short) plates.

Review and adaptation
The maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards.In order to comply with the standards the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).
The trough on the land next to the fictive ditch provides an insight into the topping. It will never be 100%.

Testing the full field spreading pattern with the hydraulic border spreading plate
[Image]
Reducing the PTO shaft rpm and closing the right spreading disc also have an influence on the spreading pattern on the left side of the spreader. The full field spreading pattern should therefore be tested when using the border spreading plate.
Follow the instructions, adjusted for border spreading, as described in  paragraph »Full field spreading pattern test« on page 81.
Operation
 Do not change the position of the border spreading plate and disconnect the right or left spreading disc.
With the first time:
 Do not change the settings of the spreader, the PTO shaft rpm or the driving speed as these should be the same as settings for border spreading.
With the second time:
 Lift the border spreading plate.
 Set the spreader for full field spreading.
 Set the RPM of the spreading discs as given in the relevant spreading chart.
 The driving speed and PTO shaft rpm must be the same as the first time.
Assessment
The middle buckets could contain less application rate. The pattern on illustration B from
 paragraph »Full field spreading pattern test« on page 81.
This is because of the lower PTO shaft rpm.
The level of the middle measuring tube in border spreading could be 25% lower than with the outer graduated tubes.
Adaptation
If the difference is more than 25%:
 Increase the spreading disc rpm by 50 rpm.
 Perform the full field spreading pattern test with the adjustments for border spreading again until the deviation is less than 25%.
 Perform the spreading pattern test of the border spreading plate anew. Adjust the position of the border spreading plate until the loss is below the legal requirements.

To be done before spreading
When using the ExactLine the aim is to obtain maximum distribution to the border with minimum loss in the ditch.
This is why the ExactLine has to be tested. Do not perform this test next to the ditch, rather mark a line behind which the fictive ditch will be.
Operation
 Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).
 Allow the hydraulic valve to run a few seconds to bring the ExactLine to working condition and to put good pressure in the accumulator.
 Close the taps in the hydraulic hose to prevent the ExactLine from ending up in a different position by accident.
 Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.
 Set the ExactLine to the environment setting as per the details given in the spreading chart for the desired working width

[Image]
Observe the permissible and safe height with regard to
· prescribed maximum height for vehicles in the road traffic regulations,
· high-voltage cables or other cables over the road;
· anticipated maximum headroom.
Pay close attention to these aspects to prevent dangerous situations that could lead to major material damage and possibly to serious physical injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check whether the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (<40km/h) on your tractor, is hidden by the implement.
 Then fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.
 Check the run of the quick coupling ropes of the power lift.<|begin_of_text|>

Driving on the road
Before travelling on a public road with your tractor and machine, you should do the following:
 Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.
 Check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors and brakes are attached properly and are working.
 Check the run of the quick coupling ropes of the power lift.
 Fit extra lighting and warning signs, if necessary.
 Check all folding parts and their locking devices:
· hopper cover,
· ExactLine
· hydraulic border spreading plate.
 Set all parts of the machine and the tractor, especially the PTO shaft, the hydraulics, the wheels and the electric system, to transport mode.
 Check the weight distribution between front and rear axles.
 Mount front weights, if necessary.
 Check the headroom of the combination.
 Lower the power lift, if necessary.
 Lock the control lever of the power lift while moving so that the machine is not lowered by accident.
 Check if the lights are in good working order.
 Check whether the dosing units are closed.
 Switch off the control box.
 Remove dirt that could fall off while on the road. A dirty road could be hazardous for other drivers.
 Control devices, e.g. ropes, hoses, etc. for remote actuation of devices such as cylinders, shall be guided and positioned in a way they never inadvertently release nor block desired movements/actuations!
 Always ensure adequate lateral securing of a mounted machine in transport position.

Friction between moving parts
Be careful of moving parts making contact with each other while working. You could accidentally touch control levers and cause the machine to move.
Only start working once all machine parts have stopped and the control lever have been secured. Wear safety shoes and gloves and work alone. If something gets jammed it could lead to personal injury.
Check the immediate vicinity
Check the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.
Never stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.
Before leaving the tractor:
· switch the PTO shaft off,
· release the pressure from the hydraulic system,
· switch the electronic control system off,
· switch the tractor off,
· remove the key from the ignition,
· engage the parking brake of the tractor.
That way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.
PTO shaft rotates after disengaging
After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.
Protecting the environment
Spreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.
Work with a closed cabin
Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.<|begin_of_text|>

INDICATION
Use in the field
Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.
· When working under moist weather conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.
· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.
· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.
· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.
Before you can make the first pass, you must make adjustments in the field to:
The following is important to ensure that the spreader works properly:
· set it to the correct height from the ground or above the crop and
· by levelling it with the lift rod adjustment and top link.
Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.
 Use the power lift to lift the machine to the correct height.
 Set the spreader horizontally with the lift rod adjustment and the top link.
 Lock the lift limiter in this position.
Height correction with top dressing
If the required height of 75 cm above the crop is not possible with your power lift
 use the high spreading setting of the linkage pins and/or
 set the spreader forward as indicated in the spreading charts.

Last setting check
96
A checklist is given below, as well as in the jacket of the spreading chart.
 Do this last check to ensure good spreading results.
Are you working with the correct settings from the correct spreading chart, based on:
· distribution,
· similar weight,
· type of fertiliser,
· desired working width,
· desired driving speed?
Did you set the spreader in the correct way? Did you:
· set the height over the ground or crops to 75 cm?
· was the correct vane combination mounted?
· are the correct number of dosing openings opened (fine application)?
· is the correct discharge point set?
· is the correct application rate set?
· is the correct GEOPOINT® (centre spreading pattern) set?
· is the coupling shaft fitted to the correct point on the gearbox?
· is the ExactLine or hydraulic border spreading plate in the transport setting (or working position)?
· are the data required entered in the control system?
Did you check the following settings:
Did you:
· have you checked the control system settings?
· perform a tray test to check the spreading pattern?
Work in the correct manner:
· Is the field data selected or input correctly?
· Is the GEOCONTROL application setting correct?
· Have you correctly set the offset?
 See the software instruction manual.
· Did you set the correct PTO shaft rpm?
· Are you driving at the correct driving speed?
· Did you set the tramlines at the correct distance?
· Wind speed too high?<|begin_of_text|>

Working with the GEOCONTROL
Starting a new task is done from a saved field or one to be created newly with the GEOCONTROL application.
 Refer to the GEOCONTROL manual in your terminal for this purpose.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass. The headland will act as the field boundary and is saved in GEOCONTROL.
A broad headland is desirable in order to make the connection to the headland before turning in from the pass.
 Spread a broad or double headland so that you make the connection while driving straight before making a turn.
Thereafter, the field can be filled in full passes. You can create a (spray)track pattern for following processes.
Prevent drive errors
It is important that the spreading patterns overlap well to ensure good distribution. A difference in the overlapping is less vital with average working widths, using a triangular spreading pattern.
Differences in the spreading pattern would easily be noticed with a trapezium shape on very large working widths, in particular. The overlap of the spreading pattern is then much smaller and therefore more sensitive to mistakes.
This can be prevented by setting tramlines before hand. This can be done by setting out tramlines on the headlands and marking them with, for example, picket poles.
Visibility of the from headland to headland is very important. Place additional markers in the field if necessary to ensure that the track is clearly visible.
When controlled by the GEOCONTROL the spreader has the option of reducing the working width in order to connect the incomplete final pass with the next one.

Your preferred border spreading method determines the tramline pattern.
Select on the basis of the site width, the presence of the spreader tramlines and the spreader's equipment.
Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) when doing boundary track spreading with ExactLine (optional extra).
 Set the first way at half the working width (1/2 X meter) from the field edge (in the first sprayer tramline).
