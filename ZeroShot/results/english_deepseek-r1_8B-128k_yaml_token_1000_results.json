The spreader does these tests every time it has spread 75 kg of fertilizer or every minute.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if it's every 75 kg or every minute.

The context also talks about adjusting stabilizers and linkage pins, but those are more about the tractor's stability rather than the coupling shaft's angle. Then there's a section on checking the PTO shaft and connector safety, which is about ensuring everything is secure but doesn't relate to the angle.\n\nLooking back at the question, it's asking for both when lifted and lowered. The tip clearly states 30 degrees in both cases. So I don't need to infer anything else; the information is provided directly.\n\nI should also check if there are any other mentions of angles elsewhere. Scanning through, I see another part about the coupling shaft needing space for sliding in and out, but that's more about the mechanical movement rather than the angle limit. The key point is the 30-degree maximum operating angle mentioned in the tip.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be exactly as stated: 30 degrees when lifted and 30 degrees when lowered.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum permissible operating angle for the coupling shaft is **30\u00b0** when lifted and **30\u00b0** when lowered.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg per minute based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about \"Setting the spreader\" and then a \"Calculation\" part. Under calculation, it mentions that as two of the three dosing openings are closed, the flowrate should be three times as much to ensure an even application rate. \n\nThen, under the list items, one of them says: \"Read the Dosing Setting, Discharge Point and Flowrate from the spreading chart. Calculate the flowrate with the formula given below as required.\" So there's a formula involved here.\n\nFurther down, it shows the formula: flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha). There's also a note that if the application rate isn't indicated in the chart, you can calculate it this way. \n\nSo putting it all together, the formula seems to be working width multiplied by driving speed and then by the application rate. That makes sense because each of those factors contributes to determining how much fertilizer is applied over a certain area per minute.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other parts.

The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.\" Another point mentions placing the loading platform at the spreader so that the distance is a maximum of 200 mm.\n\nSo, putting this together, the context specifies two distances: one when using a fixed platform (200 mm) and another when manually filling with large bags or without a platform (1250 mm). However, the question specifically asks for the maximum distance between the spreader and the loading platform. \n\nThe key point is that when a fixed loading platform is used, the machine must be driven to it, and the distance can't exceed 200 mm.

It mentions several tasks under different time frames: after the first 10 hours, weekly, and every 100 hours per year. Each task is listed with specific numbers or symbols indicating their frequency.\n\nLooking at the section about Maintenance, there's a table that lists various checks. The vanes are mentioned in two places: once as \"Condition of the vanes\" under Inspection, and again later in the same list. However, I notice that after the first 10 hours, the condition of the vanes is marked with an empty string ('). Similarly, in the weekly and annual intervals, it's also empty.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The table has columns for different time frames: \"af te r th e first 10 hou rs:\", \"we ekly:\", and \"ev ery 1 00 ho urs min. 1 x per ye ar:\". Each row corresponds to a specific task.\n\nLooking at the rows, I see that under \"Condition of the vanes,\" there's an empty string in all three intervals. That suggests that the vane inspection isn't listed as a routine maintenance task in these intervals. But earlier, it was mentioned under Inspection with no time frame specified.\n\nHmm, maybe the context is indicating that the condition of the vanes isn't part of the scheduled maintenance intervals provided. Since there's no specific interval given for the vanes in the table, I should consider whether they're inspected at any other time or if the information is missing.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the frequency of inspection for the vanes. If the context doesn't specify an interval for this particular task within the maintenance schedule, then perhaps it's not covered here. Alternatively, maybe the vane condition is checked during another task, but without more details, I can't be sure.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer should state that there's no specific interval provided in the context for inspecting the vanes.\n</think>\n\nThe condition of the vanes does not have a specified inspection interval within the provided maintenance schedule.",

        "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and with a 0.13 friction be fastened?",
        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part of this means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is M18, which refers to its size\u2014M stands for metric, and 18 is the diameter in millimeters. So it's an 18mm hexagon bolt, commonly used in machinery and construction.\n\nNext, the quality is 10.9. I remember that in bolts, the \"quality\" or grade indicates strength levels. A 10.9 grade means the bolt can withstand up to 10.9 million psi (pounds per square inch) without breaking, making it suitable for high-stress applications.\n\nNow, the friction coefficient is 0.13. Friction here refers to the resistance between the bolt and the hole when they're being joined. A higher coefficient means more resistance, so a lower torque might be needed because the bolt doesn't slip easily.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table that lists torques for different sizes and qualities. The tables are labeled as Torques.X.Y.Z., where X seems to represent the quality or grade. For example, Torques.10.9.0,10. refers to a 10.9 quality bolt with some other parameter (maybe the thread type or size), and the torque values for each size from M5 up to M24.\n\nI need to find the row that matches both the quality (10.9) and the friction coefficient (0.13). Wait, in the context, I don't see a direct mention of the friction coefficient; it's only mentioned as 0.13 in the question. So maybe the tables are providing standard torques without considering friction, but the question adds that specific detail.\n\nHmm, perhaps the table is for static torque, and when dynamic conditions apply (like with a certain friction), the required torque might be adjusted. But since the context doesn't specify how to adjust for friction, I'm not sure if I should use the standard torque from the table or calculate it differently.\n\nWait, looking again, the tables list torques for different sizes without mentioning friction. So maybe the 0.13 is a clue that the torque needs to be adjusted based on some formula involving friction. But since the context doesn't provide such a formula, I might have to stick with the standard torque from the table.\n\nLooking at Torques.10.9.0,10., which corresponds to M18 (since it's position 5 in the list starting from M5), and quality 10.9, the torque is '7' Nm. But wait, that seems low for an M18 bolt with high strength. Usually, higher grade bolts require more torque because they're stronger and need more force to prevent stripping.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the positions. Let me list them out:\n\nTorques.10.9.0,10.:\n0: 7\n1:13\n2:31\n3:60\n4:105\n5:165\n6:260\n7:350\n8:500\n9:670\n10:860\n\nSo position 5 is M18 (since starting from M5 as 0, so M5=0, M6=1,... up to M24=10). So for M18, it's index 5. The torque at index 5 is '165' Nm.\n\nWait, but in the context, Torques.10.9.0,10. has indices from 0 to 10, corresponding to M5 to M24. So M18 would be index 5 (since M5=0, M6=1,... M18=5). The value at index 5 is '165' Nm.\n\nBut the question mentions a friction coefficient of 0.13. If that's dynamic torque, maybe it's lower than static. However, without a formula or adjustment in the context, I can't apply any changes. So perhaps the answer is just the standard torque from the table, which is 165 Nm for M18 with 10.9 quality.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Torques.10.9.0,10. had '7' at index 5, but that doesn't make sense because M18 should be higher. Maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\nIndices: 0-M5,1-M6,...,5-M18.\n\nSo for Torques.10.9.0,10., the values are:\n\n0:7 (M5)\n1:13 (M6)\n2:31 (M8)\n3:40 (M10)\n4:70 (M12)\n5:115 (M14)\n6:175 (M16)\n7:250 (M18)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for M18, it's",

        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part of the question means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is an M6, which refers to its size. M stands for metric, and 6 indicates the diameter in millimeters, so it's 6mm. Hexagon bolts have six flat sides on the head, making them easy to grip with a wrench.\n\nNext, the material is stainless steel, which is good because it's durable and resistant to corrosion. The quality is 70 (A2). I'm not entirely sure what A2 means here, but I think in standards like ISO or DIN, A2 might refer to a specific grade of stainless steel, perhaps indicating tensile strength or other mechanical properties.\n\nThe friction coefficient is given as 0.2. Friction affects how much torque is needed to prevent the bolt from loosening. Lower friction means less torque is required because there's less resistance when tightening.\n\nNow, looking at the context provided, it seems like there are tables listing torques for different sizes and types of bolts. The tables have columns for various M sizes (M5 to M24) and rows with numbers that likely correspond to specific torque values in Nm.\n\nI need to find the row that corresponds to an M6 bolt. Scanning through, I see a section labeled \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" which might be relevant because 4.6 could relate to some standard or class of bolts, and 10 might indicate the number of items or something else. The numbers under this row are: 1,7; 3; 8; 16; 27; 42; 65; 90; 125; 170; 210.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because earlier in the context, there's a table for Torques.4.6.0,10., which has values like '1,7', '3', etc. But I'm not sure how to interpret these numbers. Maybe they're torque values for different sizes or something else.\n\nLooking further down, there's another section: \"Torques.8.8.0,10.\" with values 5;9;21;40;70;115;175;250;350;600. This seems more likely because it's a sequence that could correspond to M6 through M24. The numbers here are in increments that make sense for torque.\n\nGiven that the friction coefficient is 0.2, I think this would be part of the calculation. Torque required is often calculated using the formula: Torque = (Friction Coefficient * Bolt Capacity) / (Number of Threads or something similar). But without the exact formula, I need to rely on the context.\n\nLooking at the tables again, the \"Torques.8.8.0,10.\" row has 70 as one of the values. Since M6 is in the middle of this range (M6 would be around position 1 or 2 if starting from M5), and considering the friction coefficient, I think 70 Nm is the correct value.\n\nI should double-check to make sure there's no other table that might have a different value for M6 with 0.2 friction. The next section is \"Torques.8.8.0,13.\" which starts at 6 and goes up, but I think that's for higher quality or different standards.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the torque required for an M6 stainless steel bolt with A2 quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient is 70 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten the M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt under the given conditions is **70 Nm**.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that there are several sections about maintenance and safety. One section is titled \"Storing the machine,\" which mentions that it's advisable to lubricate, clean, and then lubricate again before storing. This suggests that not lubricating could lead to problems like dirt or water entering the bearings, which would be bad.\n\nAnother part talks about cleaning the machine and mentions that after cleaning, you should grease and oil all items once again for conservation. So, if you don't lubricate the grease nipples, they might not function properly, leading to wear or damage over time.\n\nThere's also a section on using high-pressure cleaners, advising not to aim them at seals and breathers to prevent dirt and moisture from entering gearboxes. This implies that without proper lubrication, these areas could become contaminated, affecting performance.\n\nAdditionally, the context warns about corrosion caused by fertilizers and salts, which can weaken the machine's construction and reduce its lifespan. Proper maintenance like lubrication helps prevent such issues.\n\nPutting this together, not lubricating the grease nipples likely leads to dirt and moisture entering the bearings, causing wear, potential corrosion, and reducing the machine's longevity.\n</think>\n\nIf the machine grease nipples are never lubricated, dirt and moisture can enter the bearings, leading to wear and tear. This can result in reduced performance and a shorter lifespan of the machine.",

It mentions that at the end of the season, the machine must be prepared. One part talks about lubricating and cleaning the machine before storing it, which helps prevent dirt, fertilizer, and water from entering bearings. After cleaning, they grease and oil all items again for conservation.\n\nThen, looking further down, there's a list of steps under \"Storing the machine.\" One of these is to paint any damaged paintwork. The context doesn't specify the type of paint directly, but it does mention that only grease that wouldn't harden or dry should be used to prevent damage to cylinder oil seals. However, this is about grease, not paint.\n\nWait, I'm looking for paint. Let me check again. The part about painting says \"Paint any damaged paintwork.\" There's no specific type of paint mentioned here. It just says to paint the damaged areas.

The Preface mentions that the manual is intended for agrarians and others trained in agriculture, specifically those who are competent to operate the machine as required by national legislation and have knowledge of assembly activities.\n\nLooking further into the For your safety section, it says that everyone using or assembling the implement should be familiar with the manual's contents. It also notes that if someone isn't sure about something, they should contact the manufacturer. There's a list of reasons why having the manual available is important: to avoid accidents, respect warranty conditions, and keep the machine in good working order.\n\nIn the For the employer section, there are specific points like ensuring all personnel are authorized by national legislation and trained regularly (at least once a year) according to employers' liability insurance guidelines. It also mentions that untrained or unauthorized individuals aren't allowed to use the machinery. Additionally, the employer is responsible for providing personal protective gear.\n\nNow, I'm looking for information about the curriculum or training program specifically. The context doesn't explicitly list out the training modules or courses. It does mention that people need to be trained in the use of the machine regularly and according to certain guidelines, but it doesn't go into detail about what those guidelines include or the specific content of the training.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the curriculum, I have to consider whether any indirect information can be used. The context does state that people must be competent as per national legislation and have knowledge of assembly activities. However, without specifics on what that entails, it's unclear.\n\nGiven this, the most precise answer based on the provided context is that the training involves regular sessions at least once a year, following employers' liability insurance guidelines.

However, in the given context, there's no explicit mention of the material\u2014only that the tap is closed. So I don't have information on whether it's made of metal, plastic, or another material.\n\nSince the context doesn't specify the material, I can't provide an exact answer. Therefore, based on the instructions, if the information isn't found, I should respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the material used for the 'tap' in the hydraulic border spreading plate. \n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context is about preparing a tractor and machine for transportation. It lists several steps that should be taken before traveling on public roads. One of these steps is checking whether the tractor and machine are roadworthy, which includes things like lights, brakes, etc. But I'm specifically looking for tire pressure information.\n\nLooking through the list of items under \"Preparing the machine to be transported\" and \"Driving on the road,\" I see that there's a mention of checking the run of the quick coupling ropes of the power lift. Hmm, that doesn't seem directly related to tire pressure.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go back. The context includes several bullet points under the section header \"Preparing the machine to be transported.\" One point is about checking the weight distribution between front and rear axles. Another mentions mounting front weights if necessary. There's also a check for headroom of the combination and lowering the power lift.\n\nI'm still not seeing anything directly about tire pressure. Maybe I should look again. Oh, here's another bullet point: \"Check whether the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (40km/h) on your tractor, is hidden by the implement.\" That's about visibility, not tires.\n\nAnother point says to remove dirt that could fall off while on the road because a dirty road could be hazardous for other drivers. Still nothing about tire pressure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about tire pressure range in transport mode. Since the context doesn't explicitly mention tire pressure, maybe it's not provided here. Alternatively, maybe it's implied that proper inflation is part of being roadworthy, but without specific numbers, I can't extract a range.\n\nI should check if there's any other section or bullet point that refers to tires beyond what's listed.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 106, there's a section about border spreading. It mentions that when doing one-sided boundary spreading, you drive along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. The control system doesn't automatically calibrate during this process, so the application rate might deviate. It also says to spread the field first before the borders because then the control system can determine the correct dosing setting.\n\nHmm, but I'm specifically looking for a speed reduction percentage. On page 105, there's information about over and underdosing. It talks about using the control system to over or under dose during spreading, especially in one-sided operations. The spreading patterns overlap, affecting the application rate, especially with narrow working widths.\n\nWait, but I'm focusing on border spreading now. Page 106 discusses two methods: one-sided boundary spreading and boundary track spreading. For one-sided, you drive along the edge and spread inward. It doesn't mention speed here, though.\n\nI don't see any specific numbers about speed reduction in the context provided. The closest is that during border spreading, the control system can't automatically adjust, so manual calibration might be needed. But there's no exact percentage given for how much to reduce the speed.\n\nSo, based on the information, I don't have a specific number or percentage for the optimal driving speed reduction.

There's no mention of millimeters or any numerical value here.\n\nAnother TextItem mentions that if the dosing baffles slide far over each other, the application rate will be lower. But again, no specific measurement is given about the crack size.\n\nThe only relevant information is that a small crack is visible when closed, but without any numbers or units provided in the context. Since the question asks for the dimension in millimeters, and there's no data supporting that, I have to conclude that this information isn't available here.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

It mentions that you can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately. The text says: \"You can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately.\" \n\nWait, but I'm specifically asked about the material of the feeler gauge. The context doesn't explicitly state the type of material. It just mentions using a feeler gauge without specifying if it's made of a particular material like metal or plastic.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about what's standard for feeler gauges. Typically, they're made from materials that are thin and flexible, like nickel or stainless steel, but the context doesn't provide this information. Since the context only says \"feeler gauge\" without specifying, perhaps it's safer to say that the material isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, based on the given text, there's no specific recommendation for the material of the feeler gauge. Therefore, I should respond that the type of material isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the material recommended for the feeler gauge used to check the discharge bushing height. \n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

Scanning through the context again, I see a TextItem that mentions \"Metal seal ring\" right after some PictureItems on page 141. This suggests that the term \"metal seal ring\" is used in the context of the parts being discussed.\n\nSince the question specifically asks about the material, and given that they're referred to as \"metal seal rings,\" it's reasonable to deduce that their material is metal. There's no further information provided about specific types of metals or materials beyond the term \"metal.\" So, without additional details, the answer should be straightforward.\n\nI don't see any other references in the context that would change this conclusion. The instructions are clear to base the answer on the given context and provide an extremely precise answer.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the context, there are several sections about different cables and accessories related to ISO 11786 connections. The main focus is on the \"Input IM Tellus\" cable, which is supplied as a standard item. This cable has a 7-point plug, and it's used for various connections in the tractor.\n\nI see that an extended ISO cable is mentioned specifically for tractors with a trailed spreader. It says that this extended cable replaces the short one already fitted and needs to be exchanged entirely. The length isn't directly stated here, but I notice that there's a mention of a wire-connecting diagram in the spare parts manual, which might provide more details.\n\nHowever, the context doesn't explicitly state the length of the extension cable. It only mentions that an extended ISO cable is available for tractors with a trailed spreader and that it replaces the existing short cable. Without specific measurements or diagrams provided in the text, I can't determine the exact length.\n\nSince there's no numerical information about the cable's length in the context, I should respond by stating that the information isn't found.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal extension cable length for ISO 11786 in-cab tractor connection is not specified in the provided context. \n\nAnswer: Not found in context",
