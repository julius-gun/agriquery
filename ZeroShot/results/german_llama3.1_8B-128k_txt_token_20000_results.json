The exact number of hours varies depending on the type of battery and its capacity. \n\nA typical 12V lead-acid battery is good for around 3-5 years or 3000-5000 charge/discharge cycles, while an AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) battery can last up to 7-10 years.\n\nIf we assume that the IsoMatch Tellus GO uses a standard 12V lead-acid battery, it is likely that it can operate for around 3-5 years before needing to be replaced.",

However, based on the context, we can infer that the material is likely a type of plastic or rubberized material.\n\nThe text mentions \"hydraulisches Grenzstreublech\" (hydraulic grease) and \"Pelletsieb\" (pellet sieve), which are both related to the hopper system. It also mentions \"Schutzbleche\" (protective cover) and \"Abdeckplane\" (hopper cover), but it does not specify what material is used for these components.\n\nHowever, in a general context, sailcloth or sailcloth is often made from a type of plastic or rubberized material to provide UV resistance.",
