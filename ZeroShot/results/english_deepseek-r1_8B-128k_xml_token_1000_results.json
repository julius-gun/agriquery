It says the spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertilizer being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these measurements with the set application rate and adjusts accordingly. So this seems relevant because it mentions the use of weighcells for continuous measurement.\n\nPage 31 discusses the flowrate and dosing settings, mentioning that the computer calculates the required flowrate using a formula involving working width, driving speed, and application rate. It also talks about automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or minute, which helps determine the correct dosing setting based on the fertilizer type. However, while this explains how the system adjusts, it doesn't specify what exactly measures the quantity being spread.\n\nPutting it all together, page 30 clearly states that weighcells are used to continuously measure the fertilizer quantity.

The text mentions that the decoupling ropes must never be tense and should allow sufficient freedom for movement. It specifically warns that if the power lift is in the lowest position, the ropes might otherwise accidentally disconnect the quick coupling. This could lead to damage or personal injury.\n\nSo, focusing on the question: What must be ensured with decoupling ropes during power lift connection? The key point here is that the decoupling ropes should not be tense. Tension would make them less flexible and more likely to cause issues when the machine is moving. Instead, they need to remain loose enough to allow movement without risking disconnection.\n\nI don't see any other specific instructions about the decoupling ropes beyond their tension. The context doesn't mention anything else like securing them or specific lengths, just that they shouldn't be tense. So, the main thing to ensure is that the decoupling ropes are not too tight.\n</think>\n\nThe decoupling ropes must remain loose to allow sufficient movement and prevent accidental disconnection during power lift connection.",

It mentions that if the selected application rate or driving speed isn't indicated in the spreading chart, you can calculate the flowrate using a specific formula.\n\nFurther down on page 68, under the \"Calculation\" subsection, it says: \"As 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed, the flowrate of the remaining dosing opening should be three times as much to obtain an even application rate.\" Then, there's a formula provided:\n\nflowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)\n\nWait, but that seems like it's already considering the 3 dosing openings. So if two are closed and one is open, the flowrate from that single opening needs to be three times higher to maintain an even application.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the formula given in the context for calculating the required flowrate when using the fine application kit with 3 open holes is:\n\nflowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)\n\nBut I should double-check if there's any additional steps or factors mentioned.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: \"When loading manually, what's the maximum distance in mm between the hopper rim and the ground before a platform is mandatory?\" \n\nFirst, I'll read through the context provided carefully. The context is from page 74 of some manual or guide related to machinery operations, probably agricultural equipment given the mention of fertilizers and spreaders.\n\nLooking at the text on page 74, there's a section titled \"To be done before spreading\" which includes several points about preventing chunks in fertilizer by using hopper covers under moist conditions. Then, further down, it talks about loading platforms.\n\nSpecifically, I see this paragraph: \"A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags.\" So that's a key point here.\n\nThe question is asking for the maximum distance before a platform becomes mandatory. The context says that if the distance exceeds 1250 mm, a platform must be used. Therefore, the threshold is at 1250 mm. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not misinterpreting this. It's saying that when manually filling, if the hopper rim is more than 1250 mm above the ground, you must use a loading platform. So the maximum allowed without needing a platform would be 1250 mm.\n\nWait, but sometimes in such contexts, it might refer to the minimum distance where a platform is required. So if it's over 1250 mm, then the maximum allowed without a platform is 1250 mm. That makes sense because anything above that requires a platform.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other parts of the context that mention this. Scanning through, I see another part about using a fixed loading platform with a max distance of 200 mm between the machine and the platform, but that's about how close they need to be, not the height.\n\nSo, focusing on the exact sentence: \"A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags.\" That directly answers the question. The maximum allowed without needing a platform is 1250 mm.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum distance between the hopper rim and the ground before a platform is mandatory when loading manually is **1250 mm**.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how often the condition of the vanes should be inspected based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 125, there's a table listing maintenance intervals. The entries are numbered from 0 upwards. Scanning through the list, I see entry number 4: \"Condition of the vanes\". It has two checkmarks (\u00b7) next to it and is assigned a time interval of 43 hours. Wait, that seems a bit odd because usually, such inspections aren't done every 43 hours. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me look again. The table starts with \"Page\" number 125, and under \"Part/action\", it lists various checks. For example, entry 0 is an inspection, then entry 1 is checking bolts and nuts every 130 hours, and so on. Entry 4 is about the vanes, and it's marked as \u00b7 next to both columns, with a time of 43. Hmm, that still doesn't make much sense because 43 hours is less than two days, which seems too frequent for an inspection.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the numbers after \"Page\" refer to something else, not the page number. Or perhaps the table's formatting is off. Alternatively, could it be that the time interval is in minutes? But even then, 43 minutes doesn't make sense for a weekly or annual check.\n\nLooking back at the context, on page 124, there's information about oil and grease content, but nothing directly about vanes. On page 125, under maintenance intervals, the vanes are mentioned as entry 4 with a time of 43. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 430 hours or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table structure. The columns might represent different aspects, but without clear headers, it's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the numbers after \"Page\" are not related to the intervals but to something else.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on page 125, entry 4 is about vanes with a time of 43, which seems too frequent. Maybe it's an annual check, and 43 refers to something else, like a code or section number. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, perhaps the table uses a different notation. The first column might be the action, and the second is whether it's required (\u00b7) or not. The numbers after that could be the interval in some format. For example, entry 4: \"Condition of the vanes\" with two checkmarks and time 43. Maybe 43 refers to a specific section or code number, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the intended interval is weekly (every 10 hours) as mentioned earlier in the context on page 125: \"If worn Page\" and \"As recommended If worn\". Wait, that doesn't clarify much.\n\nWait, perhaps the time intervals are cumulative. For example, entry 0 is an inspection every 130 hours, then another at 131, etc., but that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vanes are inspected once a year, as some other parts have annual checks. But in the table, entry 4 has 43, which doesn't align with that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user's question is about how often the condition of the vanes must be inspected. From the context, on page 125, under maintenance intervals, entry 4 specifically mentions \"Condition of the vanes\" with a time interval of 43. Maybe that's the answer, even if it seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a formatting issue in the table, and the actual interval is weekly or monthly. But based on the given text, I have to go with what's written: 43 hours for the vanes condition check.\n\nWait, but 43 hours is about 1.79 days, which seems too frequent for an inspection. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant 430 hours (about 18 days), which would make more sense as a weekly or bi-weekly interval.\n\nBut without clear clarification in the context, I have to go with what's provided. So, the answer is that the vanes must be inspected every 43 hours.\n</think>\n\nThe condition of the vanes must be inspected every **43 hours**.",

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, on page 125, there's a table listing maintenance intervals. The entries are numbered from 0 upwards. Looking at the table:\n\n- Entry 7 is \"Checking and setting the discharge bushing height\" with a checkmark and some numbers.\n- Entry 6 is \"Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism\" also marked.\n\nI think these two entries are related to the discharge settings. The question specifically asks about the bushing height and the discharge setting, so I need to find their intervals.\n\nLooking at the table's columns, each entry has a number of dots (\u00b7) indicating whether it's part of the interval. For example:\n\n- Entry 6: \u00b7 and \u00b7, which probably means it's done every certain hours or weeks.\n- Entry 7: Only one dot, so maybe once per year.\n\nWait, looking closer, the table headers say \"da il y\" which might be a typo, but the numbers under each part are the intervals. For example:\n\n- Entry 0 is Inspection, done weekly every 10 hours.\n- Entry 1 is Checking bolts and nuts, done every 100 hours (which is about a week).\n- Entry 2 is Hydraulic system check, same as above.\n\nContinuing down, entry 6: \u00b7 and \u00b7, so maybe twice a year? Or every 100 hours?\n\nWait, the table's columns have \"Quantity\" and \"Specifications\". The numbers after \"As recommeded If worn\" might indicate the interval. For example:\n\n- Entry 0: Inspection is weekly every 10 hours.\n- Entry 1: Every 100 hours (which is about a week).\n- Entry 2: Same as above.\n\nLooking at entry 6 and 7:\n\n- Entry 6: Checking discharge point setting mechanism has \u00b7 and \u00b7, so maybe every 100 hours or once per year.\n- Entry 7: Checking bushing height only has one dot, so perhaps once per year.\n\nWait, but the numbers after \"As recommeded If worn\" for entry 6 is 136, which might be a page number. Maybe it's every 100 hours (about a week) or once per year.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me check again. The table on page 125 lists maintenance actions with their intervals. Entry 6 and 7 are both about discharge settings. Entry 6 has two dots, so maybe done twice a year? Or every time the machine runs for 100 hours?\n\nWait, looking at entry 0: Inspection is weekly every 10 hours. So that's every hour of operation.\n\nEntry 1: Every 100 hours (about a week). So similar to entry 6 and 7.\n\nBut I'm not sure if entries 6 and 7 have the same interval as entry 1, which is every 100 hours or once per year.\n\nWait, in the table, after \"As recommeded If worn\" there are numbers like 130, 131, etc. Maybe those refer to page numbers where more info is given.\n\nBut for the answer, I think it's safe to say that both checking the bushing height and setting the discharge should be done once per year based on entry 7 having one dot.\n</think>\n\nThe bushing height check and discharge adjustment must be performed once annually. \n\nAnswer: Once per year.",

Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see that on page 129, there's a table listing torques for different sizes and qualities of bolts and nuts. The columns are labeled with numbers like 4.6, 8.8, 10.9, etc., which I think correspond to the torque values in Nm. The rows are for different bolt sizes, from M5 up to M24.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for M18 and the column for 10.9 quality. Scanning through, I see that under \"M18\", there are two numbers: 90 and 110 Nm. The first number is probably for a lower torque, maybe 4.6 or something else, but since the question specifies 10.9 quality, I should look at the second number in that row.\n\nWait, no, actually, each row has two numbers per size. For M18, it's 90 and 110 Nm. The first number is likely for a standard torque, and the second might be for higher or lower something. But the question mentions a friction coefficient of 0.13, which I think affects the torque.\n\nIn the context, there's a note that says \"* The friction coefficient of 0.10 applies to oiled sheets, cast iron, hardened surfaces, greased threads, etc. The higher value of 0.13 applies to dry sheets.\" So, if the bolt is being fastened with a 0.13 friction, it probably uses the higher torque from that row.\n\nLooking back at the table, for M18 and 10.9 quality, the second number is 110 Nm. Since the friction coefficient is 0.13, which is higher than the default 0.10, I should use the higher torque value from the pair. So, it's 110 Nm.\n\nI think that's it. The torque needed is 110 Nm for an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten the M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient is **110 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:** 110",

Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see that on page 129, there's a table listing torque guidelines for different sizes of bolts and nuts. The columns are labeled as Quality, Friction Coefficient, and Torques in Nm. Each row corresponds to a specific bolt size, from M5 up to M24.\n\nLooking at the rows, each has two torque values: one for 10 Nm and another for 13 Nm. I think these correspond to the lower and upper limits or maybe the recommended range for applying the torque.\n\nI need to find the row that matches an M6 bolt with a friction coefficient of 0.2. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- For M6, there's a Quality column with values like 1,7; 3; etc., but I'm not sure what those numbers mean. Maybe they're different grades or something else.\n\nWait, the table seems to have headers: Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques. Then numbers follow. It looks like each row starts with numbers separated by periods, which might indicate different aspects like quality, friction, and torques.\n\nLooking again, I see that for M6, under Quality, it's 1,7; then Thread Torques are 3 and 4. So maybe the first number is the lower torque and the second is the upper?\n\nBut wait, the question specifies a friction coefficient of 0.2. The note at the bottom says that the higher value (0.13) applies to dry sheets, but for oiled or other surfaces, it's 0.10. Hmm, but the question mentions 0.2, which isn't directly addressed here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table might have two friction coefficients: 0.10 and 0.13. Since the question is about 0.2, perhaps that's not covered in this context. But the note says exceptions are listed elsewhere, so maybe it's assumed to use 0.10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.2 is a typo or misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- M6 row: Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques\n   - 1,7; 3; 4,6; 8,8; 10,9; 12,9\n\nWait, perhaps the first number is the quality, then friction, and then torques. So for M6:\n\n- Quality: 1,7 (maybe A2 corresponds to 1,7)\n- Friction: 3\n- Torques: 4,6 Nm (lower) and 8,8 Nm (upper)\n\nBut the question mentions a friction coefficient of 0.2, which isn't directly in the table. The note says that 0.10 applies to oiled surfaces, so maybe we use that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the torques are based on the lower friction value. So for M6 with A2 quality and 0.2 friction (assuming it's similar to 0.10), the lower torque would be 4 Nm and upper 6 Nm.\n\nBut wait, the table shows for M6: Torques 3 and 4. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first number after Quality is the friction coefficient, so for M6:\n\n- Quality: A2 (maybe 1,7)\n- Friction: 0.10 or 0.13\n- Torques: lower 3 Nm and upper 4 Nm\n\nBut the question specifies 0.2, which isn't in the table. Since the note says that 0.10 applies to oiled surfaces, maybe we use that.\n\nSo, for M6 with A2 quality and 0.10 friction, the torques would be lower at 3 Nm and upper at 4 Nm.\n\nBut the question asks for a torque of 0.2, which isn't in the table. Since it's not specified, perhaps we default to the closest value or assume 0.10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.2 is a typo, and they meant 0.13, but that's still not in the table.\n\nWait, looking again at the note: \"The higher value of 0.13 applies to dry sheets.\" So if it's oiled, use 0.10.\n\nBut the question says 0.2, which isn't mentioned. Maybe it's a mistake, and they meant 0.10 or 0.13.\n\nAssuming that, for M6 with A2 quality and 0.10 friction, the torques are 3 Nm (lower) and 4 Nm (upper).\n\n",

Let me start by understanding what one-sided boundary spreading is from the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 28 of the context, it mentions that one-sided boundary spreading can be done using a hydraulic border spreading plate on either side. It also talks about optimizing the spreading pattern to reduce environmental pollution when adjusting the border spreading plate. The key point here is that this method allows spreading right up to the field edge.\n\nNow, considering small gardens, I think about the size and how one-sided boundary spreading might work there. Since it's a one-sided approach, maybe it's more efficient for smaller areas because you don't have to spread on both sides simultaneously. It also mentions that ExactLine helps minimize loss over the border, which is important for environmental reasons but could be beneficial in small spaces where waste might be more noticeable.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if there are any specific limitations mentioned about the size of the garden. The context doesn't explicitly state whether one-sided boundary spreading is better or worse for smaller gardens compared to larger ones. It just explains how it works and its benefits regarding overlap and environmental impact.\n\nSo, based on the information given, one-sided boundary spreading allows for efficient use near borders and can be adapted for smaller areas. There's no direct indication that it's not suitable, so I think it might be suitable, especially since it allows for precise application without needing to cover both sides extensively.\n</think>\n\nOne-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens as it allows efficient application close to the border with minimal waste and can be adapted to smaller areas.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFrom the context, I see that the IM Tellus Input cable is mentioned in relation to ISOBUS functionality. It says, \"The 'IM Tellus Input' cable, supplied as a standard item, can be used for other connections.\" That's the direct mention of the IM Tellus Input cable and its use beyond what's already specified.\n\nI also note that the context discusses how the IsoMatch control box connects to tractors without their own ISO terminal. The cable is part of the IsoMatch power cable set, which allows the tractor to become ISOBUS ready. So, the primary connection is for ISOBUS communication between the tractor and the machine.\n\nBut the question is asking about other kinds of connections that this same cable can be used for. Since it's mentioned as a standard item, I think there might be additional uses beyond just ISOBUS. Maybe it's also used for other sensors or systems within the machine or tractor.\n\nLooking again, the context mentions that the GPS signal can be used via RS 232 on the control box for GEOCONTROL functionality. The IM Tellus Input cable is separate from this, but perhaps it's also involved in data transfer for other purposes.\n\nWait, the exact sentence says: \"The 'IM Tellus Input' cable, supplied as a standard item, can be used for other connections.\" So, it's explicitly stated that it's used for other connections beyond its primary purpose. However, without more details, I don't know exactly what those other connections are.\n\nBut since the instruction is to provide an extremely precise answer based on the context and if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context,\" I should stick to what's provided. The only specific mention is that it can be used for other connections, but without more info, I can't specify which ones.\n\nSo, the answer would be that it's used for other connections beyond ISOBUS, but since we don't have specifics, perhaps the best response is \"Unknown\" unless there's more to extract.\n</think>\n\nThe IM Tellus Input cable is primarily used for ISOBUS communication.

It also warns about switching it off when leaving to prevent unintended functions from being activated and potential battery drain.\n\nThen, it mentions that after starting up, the screen shows the last two selected applications. It also talks about the IsoMatch Go variant being more compact with a single screen, fewer USB connections, and no WLAN/Wifi. It adds that many additional functions are included, incorporating the latest ISOBUS developments and ease-of-use in the IsoMatch Tellus GO.\n\nOn page 35, it discusses the IsoMatch Grip accessory, which is a control unit allowing central operation of most implement functions with one handle. However, there's no mention here about connecting to an external mouse.\n\nNow, focusing on whether IsoMatch Tellus can connect to an external mouse. The context doesn't explicitly state that IsoMatch Tellus supports USB connections for external devices like mice.

The first instruction is to close the dosing units. That makes sense because you don't want any chemicals or materials left open or leaking.\n\nNext, it says to switch off the PTO shaft. The PTO (Power Take-Off) is used to engage and disengage the spreader, so stopping it prevents any movement during transport.\n\nThen, switching off the electronic control system is mentioned. This likely involves turning off any electrical components to prevent drain on batteries or potential malfunctions.\n\nSwitching the tractor off and removing keys from ignition is another step. This ensures the tractor can't be started accidentally, which is crucial for safety and preventing unauthorized use.\n\nEngaging the parking brake is important too. It secures the tractor in place, reducing the risk of it rolling away while being transported.\n\nRemoving remains from the crop, dirt, and stones is practical to prevent any blockages or damage during transport. It also keeps the machine clean, which can extend its lifespan.\n\nFixing the hopper cover ensures that the hopper is secure, preventing anything from shifting around during transportation, which could cause leaks or spills.\n\nLastly, taking all appropriate measures for road transport is mentioned, but it refers to page 93, so I should look there for more specific instructions. However, since the question is about stopping work, the primary steps are listed on page 112.\n\nPutting this together, the key measures are closing dosing units, switching off PTO, electronic control system, tractor, and parking brake.

It mentions avoiding contact with fertilizers and other materials because they can cause injuries. It also warns about wearing protective clothing like gloves and shoes to prevent contact.\n\nThere's a section on what to do if you get into contact with these materials. It says to contact a physician immediately, but since one isn't available, I need an alternative approach. The context doesn't provide specific first aid steps beyond mentioning contacting a doctor. However, it does stress the importance of wearing protective gear and following safety instructions.\n\nSo, without a physician, the best advice would be to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Since that's not an option, maybe the next step is to follow the safety guidelines provided, like wearing gloves and shoes, and carefully cleaning oneself if possible. But since the context doesn't specify what to do without a doctor, I should stick to what's given.\n\nI think the answer would be to contact a physician or seek professional medical help, but since that's not available, perhaps follow the safety precautions mentioned, like wearing protective clothing and avoiding further exposure.\n</think>\n\nIf someone falls into fertilizer and a physician is unavailable, they should immediately seek medical attention.

The reason given is to prevent dirt, fertilizer, and water from entering the bearings. If this step isn't done, those substances could cause issues.\n\nAnother section specifically addresses the consequences of not lubricating the grease nipples. It states that if you don't lubricate them, dirt and moisture can enter the gearboxes through the seals and breathers. This can lead to problems because water can cause electrical failures and also affect the bearings by allowing contaminants in.\n\nSo putting this together, not lubricating the grease nipples can result in contamination of the gearboxes, which can cause electrical issues and reduce the lifespan of the machine's components.\n</think>\n\nIf the machine grease nipples are never lubricated, dirt and moisture can enter the gearboxes through the seals and breathers.

It mentions that you can check specific points on the machine using the camera while working. But nothing here directly relates to battery consumption or operation time.\n\nMoving to page 34, there's more detail about the IsoMatch Tellus GO. It says it's a compact version with a single screen and fewer USB connections compared to the double-screen version. It also mentions that if the control box is engaged while the tractor is off, unintended functions can be activated, which could be dangerous. Importantly, it notes that the control box uses power, which can flatten the tractor battery.\n\nThe key sentence here is: \"If the box is engaged, unintended functions can be activated while you are in the danger area. Moreover, the control box uses power, as a result of which the tractor battery could be flattened.\" This directly implies that leaving the IsoMatch Tellus switched on with the engine off will drain the battery, potentially flattening it.\n\nHowever, the context doesn't provide specific hours or time frames. It only states that using the control box while the tractor is off can cause battery drainage. Therefore, without exact information on how long it takes to flatten the battery, I can't give a precise number of hours.

Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 85, there's a section about setting the hydraulic border spreading plate. One of the steps mentioned is \"Close the tap to prevent unintentional lifting of the plate while working.\" So, the tap is something that needs to be closed, likely to control the flow or pressure of something related to the plate.\n\nSince it's a hydraulic system, the tap is probably part of the hydraulic components. Hydraulic taps are commonly used to control the flow of fluid, so closing it would mean stopping the flow. This makes sense because if the tap isn't closed, the plate might lift unintentionally, which could be dangerous or inefficient.\n\nI don't see any specific materials mentioned for the tap in the context provided. The focus is on how to use and close the tap rather than what it's made of. Therefore, without more information about the material, I can only infer that it's a component used in the hydraulic system to control flow.\n</think>\n\nThe 'tap' is part of the hydraulic system used to control fluid flow, preventing unintended lifting of the plate.\n\n**Answer:** The tap is used to control fluid flow in the hydraulic system.",

Then it goes into adjusting the spreader height correctly for field work.\n\nMoving on, I see sections about setting the correct height using the power lift and adjustments with the lift rod. There's a mention of 75 cm height from the ground or crop. \n\nFurther down, there's a part discussing height correction if the required 75 cm isn't possible with the power lift.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 106, it talks about border spreading and mentions that when doing one-sided boundary spreading with a hydraulic border spreading plate, you drive along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. It also says that during border spreading, the control system doesn't automatically calibrate, so the application rate might deviate.\n\nOn page 107, it goes into more detail about one-sided boundary spreading. It explains that when using the hydraulic border spreading plate (which is an optional extra), you can adjust the working width on the side of the field edge by changing this plate. The directions mention two settings: environmental (direction 1) and yield (direction 9). \n\nIn direction 1, it says to spread less to the field edge to reduce loss but with less cover. In direction 9, it's the opposite\u2014spread more to get better cover but higher loss. It also mentions that the maximum acceptable loss is determined by environmental standards.\n\nNow, the question is about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate. From page 106, I see that when you spread the field first, the control system can determine the correct dosing setting, which helps in accurate application even during border spreading. But it doesn't directly mention speed reduction.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Page 107 talks about adjusting the hydraulic plate to change the working width but doesn't link that to speed. The context doesn't explicitly state a percentage for speed reduction. It focuses more on how much fertilizer is spread relative to the edge based on settings.\n\nSo, since there's no specific mention of speed reduction in the context provided, I can't extract an exact number or percentage from it. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context\" because the information about optimal driving speed isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

If there are parking wheels, driving to the spot and placing chocks.\n\nPage 121 is about preparation for winter storage. It mentions lubricating, cleaning, and re-lubricating to prevent dirt and moisture. Also, not using high-pressure cleaners near seals or breathers to avoid dirt and moisture in gearboxes. Not setting up electrical components because water can cause failures. Cleaning the machine, letting it dry, painting damaged parts, re-lubricating, applying preservative grease to white parts like piston rods, using non-hardening grease to prevent damage to cylinder oil seals.\n\nPage 122 is about maintenance, mentioning repairing safely before continuing work by placing on a firm surface, switching off PTO shaft, releasing hydraulic pressure.\n\nThe question is asking specifically for actions beyond cleaning and lubrication at the start of spring. So winter storage tips are probably relevant here since spring would be after winter.\n\nFrom page 121: It's advisable to first lubricate, clean, then re-lubricate. This prevents dirt, fertilizer, water from entering bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil again for conservation. Also, not using high-pressure cleaners near seals or breathers. Not setting up electrical components because of water issues.\n\nSo the key points beyond cleaning and lubrication would be:\n- Lubricate first to prevent entry of contaminants.\n- Clean thoroughly.\n- Re-lubricate after cleaning.\n- Avoid using high-pressure cleaners on certain areas.\n- Don't set up electrical components.\n- Apply preservative grease to white parts like piston rods.\n- Use non-hardening grease for oil seals.\n\nI should make sure the answer is concise and includes all these points without adding extra information. Also, match the expected format exactly as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nAt the start of the spring season, to prepare the machine for work beyond cleaning and lubrication, you should:\n\n1. Lubricate the machine first to prevent dirt, fertilizer, and water from entering bearings.\n2. Clean the machine thoroughly.\n3. Re-lubricate all points after cleaning for conservation.\n4. Avoid using high-pressure cleaners near seals or breathers to prevent dirt and moisture entry.\n5. Do not set up electrical components to avoid water-induced failures.\n6. Apply preservative grease to white parts like piston rods of hydraulic cylinders.\n7. Use non-hardening grease on cylinder oil seals to prevent damage.\n\nThese steps ensure the machine is ready for work after winter storage.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections about maintenance and adjustments for a machine, possibly a spreader or similar equipment. The key term here is \"agitator seal ring.\" I'm looking for any mention of replacement intervals or conditions that would require replacing this part.\n\nI see in page 134, under the \"maintenance\" section, it says: \"The agitator axle must turn freely from the seal ring.\" This suggests that the seal ring is part of the mechanism that allows the axle to move. Later on, there's a mention of checking if the distance between the agitator axle and the seal ring is equal on all sides. If not, adjustments can be made by moving the dosing plate.\n\nHowever, I don't see any specific numbers or operational hours mentioned for when the seal ring should be replaced. The context focuses more on how to check and adjust it rather than how often it needs replacing. There's no indication of wear limits or intervals specified in the text provided.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the lifespan of the agitator seal ring, I can't extract a specific number from the context. Therefore, based on the instructions, if the answer isn't found, I should respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

It just says there's a small crack visible. There's no mention of measurements or specific sizes, so I can't extract an exact number from the given text.\n\nI should check if there are any other parts of the context that might have this information. Page 135 talks about checking for the crack by seeing if it's visible when the dosing baffles are closed.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what type of feeler gauge material is recommended for checking the discharge bushing height. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section about maintenance, specifically on checking and setting the discharge bushing height. In this part, it mentions using a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately. That seems relevant because the question is about the type of feeler gauge material.\n\nLooking further down, under page 138, it says: \"You can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately.\" So, they recommend using a feeler gauge for this purpose. Now, I need to determine what kind of material this feeler gauge is made from.\n\nI don't see any specific mention of materials in the context provided. It just mentions that a feeler gauge should be used. There's no information about whether it's made of metal or plastic, or any other specific material. \n\nSince the question asks for the type of material recommended, and there's no explicit information given, I have to consider if perhaps the answer is \"Not found in context\" because the context doesn't specify the material beyond stating that a feeler gauge should be used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's inferred that any standard feeler gauge would work, but without more details, I can't be precise. The instructions say to provide an extremely precise answer, so if there's no specific info, the correct response is likely \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the material of the feeler gauge recommended for checking the discharge bushing height.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the specific extension cable length in meters that's optimal for an ISO 11786 in-cab tractor connection. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context mentions several cables related to ISOBUS connections. There's a mention of an \"extended ISO cable\" available for a tractor-trailed spreader. It says this extended cable replaces the short one already fitted and that it's necessary if the tractor doesn't have the ISO 11786 in-cab connection. \n\nLooking further, I see that the extended ISO cable is specifically mentioned as replacing the existing short cable. The context also refers to a wire-connecting diagram in the spare parts manual, but since I don't have access to that, I can only go by what's written.\n\nThe question is about the optimal length of this extension cable. From the context, it seems that the extended ISO cable is used when the tractor doesn't already have an ISOBUS connection. The key point here is that the cable replaces the existing one, implying that its length is sufficient for the intended purpose. However, without specific measurements or a diagram, I can't determine the exact length in meters.\n\nSince there's no numerical data provided about the cable's length, I should consider whether such information exists within the context. The context doesn't specify any particular length beyond stating that it's an extended version replacing the short one. Therefore, without explicit details, I can't provide a precise answer.\n\nIn cases where specific information isn't available, the instructions suggest responding with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Given that, I'll go with \"Unknown\" because the exact length isn't specified.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

On that page, there's a section about the IsoMatch Grip control unit and some accessories. \n\nI see a mention of \"A user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop which, after the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with...\" So this indicates that there is a free test period before the user has to purchase a licence.\n\nThe question is specifically about the duration of this free test period. The context doesn't provide an exact number of days for how long the test period lasts. It only mentions that after the expiry, you need to buy a licence.
