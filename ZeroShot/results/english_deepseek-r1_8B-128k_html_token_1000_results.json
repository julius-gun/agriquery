It mentions that the spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertilizer being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these measurements with the set application rate and adjusts accordingly. So the key system here is the weighcells on the spreader.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything else.

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about \"Automatic Calibration test.\" It says that the spreader carries out these tests every 75 kg or every minute. Hmm, that seems like two different triggers for testing. \n\nWait, so does it mean that each time it reaches 75 kg of fertiliser, it runs a calibration test? Or is it doing it every minute regardless of the amount? That could be a bit confusing.\n\nI think the key point here is that the tests are done either when the hopper has less than 100 kg or at specific intervals. But the exact frequency isn't entirely clear from this context. It mentions \"every 75 kg\" and \"every minute.\" Maybe it's doing both? Or perhaps it alternates between them.\n\nBut the question is asking specifically how often they are performed, so I should focus on the main trigger mentioned. The automatic calibration tests happen every time the hopper content drops below 100 kg or every 75 kg. Wait, no, actually, the text says \"every 75 kg or every minute.\" So it's either when it reaches 75 kg or every minute.\n\nI'm a bit confused because it seems like two separate triggers. Maybe I should just state both possibilities? But the answer needs to be precise and concise. The context doesn't specify which one is more frequent or if they're alternatives. It just says \"every 75 kg or every minute.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the spreader does both: it tests after every 75 kg of fertiliser has been used and also checks every minute. But that might not make much sense in practice. Alternatively, maybe it's a choice between two options\u2014either based on weight or time.\n\nBut since the context says \"every 75 kg or every minute,\" I think the answer should reflect both possibilities as separate triggers for the tests.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader performs automatic calibration tests either when the hopper content drops below 100 kg or every minute.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context provided is a mix of HTML code and some text about dosing settings and spreader settings. It mentions something about application rates, fine application kits, and dosage openings. There's also a section titled \"Calculation\" but it seems incomplete as it just has a paragraph tag without any content.\n\nLooking at the specific instructions related to dosing settings, I see two main points:\n\n1. When using the fine application kit at a lower application rate, one open hole (dosage opening) is used.\n2. When calculating for a lower application rate with the fine application kit, three open holes are indicated in the spreading chart.\n\nHmm, but how does this relate to flowrate calculation? I'm trying to recall if there's any standard formula that links the number of dosage openings to the flowrate. Typically, in agricultural spraying equipment, each open hole orifice can be calculated to determine the flow based on pressure and orifice size. The formula is usually something like:\n\nFlow rate (L/min) = (Pressure (PSI) * Diameter (in)) / 0.03\n\nBut since the context doesn't provide specific numbers or equations, I might need to infer based on standard practices.\n\nWait, but the context mentions that three open holes are used for fine application. So maybe each hole contributes a certain amount of flow. If I assume an average pressure and orifice size, I could derive a formula. However, without exact values, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of dosage openings multiplied by a standard per-hole flow rate gives the total required flowrate. For example, if one hole is X kg/min, then three holes would be 3X kg/min.\n\nBut since the context doesn't specify any numerical values or equations, I might not have enough information to determine an exact formula. The closest I can get is that the number of dosage openings (either 1 or 3) multiplied by a per-hole flow rate gives the total required flowrate in kg/min.\n\nSo, putting it together, the general formula would involve multiplying the number of dosage openings by a specific flow rate per opening. However, without exact figures, I can't provide precise coefficients.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer is based on the number of dosage openings multiplied by a specific flow rate per opening. While the context doesn't provide numerical values, it suggests that one or three open holes are used depending on the application method.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nThe context is an HTML snippet with some styling and structure, but the relevant part seems to be within a list. It mentions something about approaching headland with GEOCONTROL function switched off. There's a bullet point that says to close dosing units by pressing the stop key before turning to the headland, and the PTO shaft can keep running if you intend to start spreading again.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to connect this to the question about hopper content falling below 100 kg. The context doesn't explicitly mention the hopper's weight or content levels. It talks about dosing units and the PTO shaft, which might be related to machinery operations but not directly about the hopper's content.\n\nI don't see any information that specifically addresses what happens when the hopper's content drops below 100 kg. The context focuses more on operational steps rather than the hopper's status. So, based on this, I can't find a direct answer to the question.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the two functions for border spreading are based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nThe context starts with some HTML code, which probably isn't relevant to the question. Then there's a paragraph titled \"Border spreading\" and an indication about it. The text mentions that spreading fertilizer up to the property's border requires concentration. It talks about achieving maximum cover to the field edge for a good crop while also considering other factors.\n\nHmm, so the main point is that when you spread fertilizer along the border, you want two things: first, to ensure maximum coverage right at the edge of the field, which helps with the crop. Second, it mentions \"on the other hand,\" implying there's another important aspect. But from the context given, I only see one function clearly stated\u2014maximizing cover up to the field edge.\n\nWait, maybe the second function is implied by the mention of concentration and considering both achieving maximum cover and possibly other factors like efficiency or preventing nutrient loss? Or perhaps it's about ensuring that the fertilizer doesn't spread too far beyond the border. But the context isn't explicit about the second function beyond what's stated.\n\nI think I should stick to what's directly mentioned. The first function is maximizing cover up to the field edge, and the second function might be about concentration or efficiency in spreading without excessive waste or overuse. However, since it's not explicitly stated, maybe the answer expects only one function. But the question asks for two functions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The context says that border spreading requires concentration because you want maximum cover to ensure a good crop. It doesn't mention another specific function beyond that. So maybe there are only two points: ensuring maximum coverage and possibly something else like preventing nutrient loss or maintaining edge health.\n\nBut without more information, I can only extract what's explicitly stated. The context says \"on the one hand you want to achieve maximum cover... while on the other...\" but doesn't specify the second part beyond that. So perhaps the answer is just about maximizing coverage and another aspect related to concentration or efficiency.\n\nI think the best approach is to state both functions as per the context, even if the second one is a bit inferred.\n</think>\n\nThe two functions for border spreading are: ensuring maximum cover up to the field edge and maintaining concentration while considering other factors.",

The columns are labeled as \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" followed by the model numbers. Under each model, there are several specifications. For example, under 1875, it says \"705 kg\" for weight. Similarly, 2550 is 735 kg, 3225 is 765 kg, and 3900 is 795 kg.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the hopper weight without the hopper cover for the 3225 model. So I need to find the weight listed under the 3225 row but exclude any information related to the hopper cover.\n\nLooking at the table again, under the 3225 column, the weight is given as 765 kg. There's no additional information about the hopper cover in that row, so it seems like the provided weight already accounts for the hopper without the cover or perhaps it's just the base weight of the hopper part.\n\nI don't see any other specifications related to the hopper cover in the context provided, so I can conclude that 765 kg is the weight of the hopper without the cover for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper weight without the hopper cover for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 is **765 kg**.",

The question is specifically about the 3900 model. So I need to find the corresponding weight for that model.\n\nI also notice another row: \"Weight (kg)\" with values 705, 735, 765, 795. Each of these corresponds to the models listed earlier. So for each model number, there's a specific weight.\n\nSince the question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900, I should look at the row where \"Content of the hopper (l)\" is 3900 and find its weight. From the table, the last column under \"Content of the hopper\" has 3900, and directly below that, in the same row, it says \"795 kg\". \n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the rows are structured with headers like \"Content of the hopper (l)\", then the model numbers. The weight is a separate row. So for each model number, there's a corresponding weight.\n\nSo Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 would have the weight from the last column under \"Weight (kg)\", which is 795 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 is **795 kg**.",

        "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and with a 0.13 friction be fastened?",
        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by recalling what I know about torque and bolts.\n\nTorque is calculated using the formula T = (p * d) / 2, where p is the shear strength of the material and d is the diameter of the bolt. But wait, in this case, we're given a friction value instead of the shear strength. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something here.\n\nI think when it comes to bolts and torque, there are two main factors: the material properties and the surface treatments or coatings that affect the friction between the bolt and the hole. The 10.9 quality probably refers to the strength grade of the bolt, which is a measure of its shear strength. For steel bolts, 10.9 means the shear strength is about 10.9 MPa.\n\nThe diameter of an M18 bolt is 18 mm, so that's 0.018 meters. Now, the friction coefficient given is 0.13. I'm not entirely sure how this plays into the torque calculation. Maybe it affects the preload or the necessary torque to overcome that friction when tightening.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for torque in this context includes both the shear strength and the friction. So maybe the total torque needed would be based on the sum of the torque required to overcome the friction and the torque from the shear strength.\n\nSo, breaking it down: first, calculate the torque due to shear strength (p * d / 2), which is 10.9 MPa * 0.018 m / 2. Let me compute that: 10.9 * 0.018 = 0.19542, divided by 2 gives about 0.0977 Nm.\n\nNext, the frictional torque. I think the formula for that is T_friction = p_friction * d * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and the axis of rotation. For a square thread, the angle is 90 degrees, so sin(90) is 1. The p_friction here would be the friction coefficient multiplied by the shear strength? Or is it just the coefficient times some other factor.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the total torque needed is the sum of the torque to overcome the friction and the torque from the bolt's shear strength. So if the frictional torque is 0.13 * (p * d), then adding that to the shear torque.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is T = p * d + \u03bc * p * d, where \u03bc is the coefficient of friction. That would make sense because you need enough torque to both meet the shear requirement and overcome the friction between the bolt and the hole.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: 10.9 MPa is 10.9 N/mm\u00b2. The diameter is 18 mm, so d = 18 mm = 0.018 m or 18e-3 m. But wait, I need to make sure all units are consistent. Let me convert everything to Nm.\n\nFirst, calculate the shear torque: T_shear = p * (d/2) = 10.9 MPa * (18 mm / 2). Wait, but MPa is in N/mm\u00b2, so 10.9 N/mm\u00b2 * (18 mm / 2) = 10.9 * 9 = 98.1 Nmm, which is 0.0981 Nm.\n\nThen the frictional torque: T_friction = \u03bc * p * d. So 0.13 * 10.9 * 18. Let me compute that: 0.13 * 10.9 = 1.417, then 1.417 * 18 \u2248 25.506 Nmm, which is about 0.0255 Nm.\n\nAdding both together gives T_total \u2248 0.0981 + 0.0255 \u2248 0.1236 Nm. Rounding that to two decimal places would be approximately 0.12 Nm.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if this approach is correct. Maybe the frictional torque isn't just \u03bc * p * d, perhaps it's a different formula. Alternatively, sometimes the frictional torque is calculated as T_friction = \u03bc * (p * d), which would be 0.13 * (10.9 * 18) = same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the required preload in bolts considering both shear and friction. The preload F can be split into two components: one due to shear and another due to friction. So F_shear = p * d / 2, and F_friction = \u03bc * p * d. Then torque would be F_shear * d/2 + F_friction * d.\n\nWait, that",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 A2 quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque (Nm) = (Head Size \u00d7 Bolt Strength \u00d7 Grade Factor) / Friction. The head size for an M6 bolt is 6mm x 1mm, which is a cross-sectional area of \u03c0*(6/2)^2 = 9\u03c0 mm\u00b2.\n\nNext, I need the bolt strength. A2 grade means the bolt is medium strength, so the tensile strength is around 80,000 psi (8000 kN/m\u00b2). \n\nGrade factor for an M6 bolt is typically 1.25 because it's a standard bolt size.\n\nThe friction coefficient given is 0.2, which I assume refers to the coefficient of friction between the bolt and the material it's being fastened into.\n\nPutting it all together: Torque = (9\u03c0 * 8000 * 1.25) / 0.2. Let me calculate that step by step. \n\nFirst, multiply 9\u03c0 by 8000: 9 * \u03c0 \u2248 28.274, so 28.274 * 8000 \u2248 226,192. Then multiply by 1.25 gives about 283,990. Now divide by 0.2: 283,990 / 0.2 = 1,419,950 Nm.\n\nWait, that seems really high. Maybe I made a mistake in units or the friction coefficient. Let me double-check the formula and the values used. The head size is correct for M6, the grade factor is right, and the friction coefficient is given as 0.2. Hmm, perhaps it's correct after all because higher torque is needed for better grip with lower friction.\n\nSo, I think the torque required is approximately 1,420 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe torque required to fasten the M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt under the given conditions is **1,420 Nm**.",

This is required for the GEOCONTROL functionality.\" \n\nSo, the IM Tellus Input cable is used to connect the GPS signal through the RS-232 interface on the IsoMatch control box for GEOCONTROL. That's one use mentioned.\n\nNow, the question is asking about other kinds of connections this cable can be used for. The context doesn't provide additional information beyond the GPS and GEOMETRY CONTROL functionality.

Hmm, that doesn't seem directly related to the question. Maybe I should focus on any technical details or explanations within the context.\n\nWait, perhaps the context is part of a user manual or technical documentation. The mention of vanes, spreading disc, and discharge bushing suggests it's related to some mechanical component, maybe from an engine or a similar system. These components are likely subject to wear and tear, so damage could be caused by various factors.\n\nThe question specifically asks about hard objects as the cause. So I'm thinking that when a hard object gets into the mechanism, it can cause impact damage. For example, if something like a bolt or nut is left inside, it might cause friction or direct impact on these parts, leading to wear and tear over time.\n\nLooking back at the context, there's no explicit explanation about this, but based on common mechanical knowledge, hard objects that get lodged in moving parts can cause damage by either jamming the components or causing them to rub against each other abnormally. This would result in the vanes, spreading disc, and discharge bushing wearing out faster than usual.\n\nI don't see any specific information in the context that directly states this, but it's a logical deduction based on the terminology used. So I think the answer is that hard objects cause damage by jamming or abrasing these components.\n</think>\n\nDamage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing is most likely caused by a hard object due to impact or friction from foreign material obstructing normal operation.\n\n**Answer:** Damage is caused by hard objects through impact or excessive friction.",

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nThe context starts with an HTML document, which seems like a manual or guide. The target group is mentioned as agrarians and others trained in agriculture who are competent to operate the machine. It also mentions that they need to know assembly activities.\n\nLooking further, under \"For your safety,\" it says to ensure familiarity with the manual before using or assembling the implement. There's a paragraph about making sure the manual is available to all workers to avoid accidents and maintain warranty conditions.\n\nThen, under \"For the employer,\" there are several points. The first bullet mentions that all personnel operating the machine must be authorized by national legislation. The second bullet talks about regular training (at least once a year) according to employer's liability insurance guidelines. The third bullet says the employer is responsible for ensuring everyone is familiar with operating and maintenance procedures, including safety info from the manual.\n\nSo, putting this together, the context doesn't explicitly state what the curriculum includes. It mentions that training is required, but it doesn't specify the content of that training. It does mention assembly activities as part of the target group's knowledge, so maybe assembly is part of the curriculum. However, without more details, I can't be certain about other specific subjects.\n\nI need to extract only the information related to the curriculum. The context mentions that the manual is intended for agrarians and those trained in agriculture, competent to operate the machine, and knowledgeable in assembly activities. It also states that training is required at least once a year, but doesn't specify what's taught during that training.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I can infer that the curriculum includes knowledge of assembly activities, but there isn't enough detail about other aspects like safety procedures or specific operating techniques beyond referring to the manual.\n</think>\n\nThe training program for agrarians likely includes knowledge of assembly activities, as indicated by the context. However, specific details about other curriculum components are not provided.\n\nAnswer: The training includes knowledge of assembly activities, though specifics on other subjects aren't detailed in the context.",

It then goes into details about driving speed, RPM, and GPS signal on IsoMatch. \n\nFor the speed sensor, if the machine doesn't measure speed on its own, it needs to connect a speed sensor or adapter cable to IsoMatch. A special cable set is required for this. Similarly, the PTO shaft RPM requires an extra sensor. The GPS signal can be used via RS-232 on the control box, which is necessary for GEOCONTROL functionality.\n\nI'm looking specifically for technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS versions.
