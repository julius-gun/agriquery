The test involves filling the spreader with fertilizer, then driving it over a measured distance while measuring the amount of fertilizer in the spreader's containers.

Drive the spreader over a measured distance (e.g., 24 meters).\n3. Measure the amount of fertilizer in the spreader's containers.\n4. Compare the results to determine if the spreader is working correctly.\n\nThe test can be performed for different types of fertilizers, including those that are not listed in the streutabelle. The test should be done at least once a year and after any changes made to the spreader or its parts.\n\nIt's also mentioned in the text that the test should be done with the spreader set up as follows:\n\n* Place a container on the land along the fiktive Graben (a line drawn on the ground).\n* Set up 2 containers at the end of the field.\n* Start the spreader and engage the drive.\n* Drive the spreader over the measured distance while opening the dosing units some meters before reaching the first container.\n* Stop the spreader when you have passed a distance of at least one half of the working width (e.g., 12 or 18 meters).\n* Check that the fertilizer is being spread evenly and accurately.\n\nThe test can be repeated if necessary to ensure the spreader is working correctly.",

Other types may also exhibit similar properties and attract water depending on their chemical composition.\n\nThe attraction of water to fertilizers is due to the fact that they have a high solubility in water, which allows them to dissolve easily in water and release moisture from the air.
