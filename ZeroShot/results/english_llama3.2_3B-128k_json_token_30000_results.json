However, I can try to rephrase it in different words:\n\nTo answer the question \"How should one proceed with caution when spreading the fertilizer?\n\nHere's a rewritten version of the original text:\n\nWhen spreading fertiliser, you must ensure that the spreader is set up correctly. This includes checking the settings and adjusting the spreader to prevent damage or injury.\n\nThe correct procedure for spreading the fertilizer is as follows:\n\n1. Switch off the tractor and remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n2. Disconnect the left spreading disc by sliding the connector to secure it with a lock clip.\n3. Set the spreader according to the settings given in the spreading chart for the selected working width, use the correct setting and coupling shaft mounting point as specified in the spreading chart, online spreading chart or the chart on the previous page.\n4. Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n5. Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!\n6. Place the buckets in the middle of the tractor tracks.\n7. Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!\n8. Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.\n9. Drive the tractor and set the RPM of the spreading discs as specified in the spreading chart or based on the spreading chart, online spreading chart or the chart on the previous page.\n10. Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n11. Check that the vanes do not touch the border spreading plate!\n12. Place the buckets at the middle of the tractor tracks.\n13. Drive the first pass with the middle of the tractor about 2 meters from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft RPM to 75%.\n14. Remove the spreader by closing the dosing unit, and close the hydraulic valve.\n15. Open the dosing units.\n16. Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules, seeds or other granules spread with ExactLine. The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra). The spreader has 2 different functions and accessories to cater for border spreading.\n17. Use in the field.\n18. Be careful that nothing gets jammed or stuck, as described in paragraph 1. Work safely with the machine:\n19. Clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and discharge bushings.\n20. Check the spreader regularly to see if the symbol of the ExactLine is not visible on screen. If the symbol disappears, the control system does not function correctly, the application rate will deviate from the set application rate through the lower PTO shaft RPM.\n21. Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules, seeds or other granules spread with ExactLine. The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra). The spreader has 2 different functions and accessories to cater for border spreading.\n22. Use in the field.\n23. Be careful that nothing gets jammed or stuck, as described in paragraph 2.
