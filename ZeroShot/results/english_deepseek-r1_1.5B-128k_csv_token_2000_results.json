One of them is \"Fine dosing.\" The text under that says: \"Fine application handle Fine application setting.\" It also mentions \"24\" as an item, but that's probably just numbering and not relevant here.\n\nLooking further down, there are two sections about fine dosing. The first one has a paragraph starting with \"The spreader has two actuators per dosing unit...\" and it says: \"Moreover, it is possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings so that the application rate can also be set precisely with a low flowrate, while the risk of blockages remains limited.\" So here, they mention shutting 2 out of 3 dosing openings.\n\nThe second section under fine dosing talks about \"Normal dosing\" and mentions: \"For precise dosing over a wide range of settings, a spreader with 3 openings is applied per disc.\" But that's not directly relevant to the question about fine application.\n\nSo putting it together, during fine application, you can shut 2 out of the 3 dosing openings. That means two are closed at the same time.\n</think>\n\nDuring fine application, 2 dosing openings are closed.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread based on the given context. Let me go through the context step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the context, there are several sections about the tractors and their operations. The first section is about getting familiar with the machine, which mentions that ExactLine is available for right and left spreading. It also talks about how it bends granules to minimize loss over the border but provides a full pattern. There's an environmental and yield setting mentioned.\n\nThen, in another section under \"Getting familiar with the machine,\" there's a part where it says the spreader uses weighcells to measure fertilizer quantity. The computer compares these values with the set application rate. It also mentions field data from new management systems or newly created boundaries are used for this purpose.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section about flowrate (kg/min) and an image of a PictureItem. There's also a text item that says \"Dosing setting\" which refers to how much fertilizer is applied per unit time.\n\nIn another part under \"Automatic Calibration test,\" it mentions the computer calculates required flowrate using the formula: Flowrate = (kg/min). It also talks about working width, driving speed, and application rate. There's a mention of 600 kg/ha being used in some cases.\n\nAdditionally, there are sections about the automatic calibration tests that determine dosing settings based on spreading chart data. The computer needs at least one measuring point from the chart, which is obtained through these tests. It also mentions using a reference sensor to correct for factors like driving speed and slopes or holes.\n\nPutting this all together, the system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread seems to be the spreader itself, specifically the computer in the distribution box. The computer uses weighcells to measure the quantity of fertiliser, compares it with the set application rate, and adjusts dosing settings based on field data from new management systems or newly created boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the system is the computer in the distribution box measuring fertilizer quantity.\n</think>\n\nThe system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread is the computer in the distribution box.",

The question is about transmission when the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication.\n\nLooking through the context, I notice a few things. There's a picture item where it mentions \"Tractor with IsoMatch\" and describes that the machine can be connected via ISO terminals or using the IsoMatch power cable set. This suggests that even without ISOBUS, the tractor can be connected to the IsoMatch.\n\nAnother part is about the ISO tractor connection on page 32. It says that tractors without their own ISO terminal can work as ISO tractors with the IsoMatch control box. So this indicates that the tractor's driving speed can indeed be transmitted through the IsoMatch even if it doesn't have its own ISO terminal.\n\nAdditionally, in section 32, there are details about how the tractor's speed is measured via the tractor electronics and a special cable set is required for this purpose. This further supports the idea that the tractor's speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch without ISOBUS communication.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are:\n1. The tractor can be connected to the IsoMatch using the ISO Match power cable set.\n2. Even without an ISO terminal, the tractor is compatible with the IsoMatch.\n3.

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each section in the context. The main sections are about the tractor's connection process, including elements like page numbers, actions, and text items with explanations. \n\nLooking at the \"Connecting to the tractor\" section, there's a TextItem that says: \"The check chains prevent the protection sleeves from rotating with the coupling shaft. Crop or pieces of clothing can be wound around rotating protection sleeves and cause material damage and possibly severe physical injury.\" This part mentions that the check chains prevent rotation but doesn't explicitly state whether the parking brake should be engaged.\n\nAnother section is about neutralizing controls, which talks about not releasing or blocking movement. It also mentions safety during connection, emphasizing proper mounting of protection sleeves. However, it doesn't mention anything directly about engaging the parking brake before connecting.\n\nIn the \"Connecting and disconnecting safely\" section, there's a TextItem that says: \"There are risks of injury involved in connecting and disconnecting the machine. Work carefully:\" This suggests that safety is a concern during connection but again, no direct info on engaging the parking brake.\n\nLooking back at the specific question, it asks if the parking brake should be engaged before connecting. The context doesn't provide any explicit instructions or actions related to this. It mainly talks about protecting protection sleeves and ensuring safe connections without mentioning the parking brake specifically.\n\nSo, based on the given context, there's no direct information in the provided sections that indicates whether engaging the parking brake is necessary before connection. Therefore, I should respond with \"Unknown\" since the answer isn't present.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

Each section has elements like page numbers, element types (like text items or pictures), content, and additional info. The question is asking about the height of the spreading disc above the troughs before testing the ExactLine pattern.\n\nI'll start by locating where the information about the ExactLine is. Scanning through the sections, I see that section 89 has a text item titled \"Testing ExactLine spreading pattern.\" That's probably where the specific details are given.\n\nIn section 89, there's a paragraph (element type: TextItem) that says: \"To be done before spreading, when using the ExactLine, the aim is to obtain maximum distribution to the border with minimum loss in the ditch. This is why the ExactLine has to be tested. Do not perform this test next to the ditch but mark a line behind which the fictive ditch will be.\"\n\nLooking further into that paragraph, there's another TextItem: \"Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!\" But wait, that's about positioning, not the height of the disc above the troughs.\n\nI need to find where it specifies the height. In section 89, under the text item for \"Testing ExactLine spreading pattern,\" I see another paragraph (element type: TextItem) titled \"To be done before spreading.\" It says: \"Set the spreader as per details given in the spreading chart for selected working width that most closely matches the fertilizer, seeds, or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs).\"\n\nSo, the height is specified as 75 cm. That's the key information needed to answer the question.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything else in the context that might provide more details about the height. Scanning through other sections like 88 and 90, they don't mention the height for ExactLine; they focus on different spreading patterns like full field or border.

The section number 91 has a lot of information about spreading and the ditch. There's a paragraph that mentions the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. It says that the quantity of fertilizer in the first trough must be a maximum of 10% of what was collected in the middle of the track, which is 100%. So, that means the middle trough should have at least 10% to comply with the standards.\n\nI also see other sections about setting the exact line and adjusting disc height, but those don't directly answer the question.

So, I can confidently extract that the middle trough must have no more than 10% loss.\n\nI should make sure to mention both \"maximum acceptable loss\" and \"percent allowed\" as they are part of the answer. Also, since the question is about the middle trough, I'll focus on that specific point.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum acceptable fertilizer loss in the ditch at the middle trough is 10% of the quantity collected in the middle of the track.\n\nAnswer: The maximum acceptable fertilizer loss in the ditch at the middle trough is 10%.",

It also mentions keeping a safe distance until the moving parts have stopped and approaching while rotating can cause serious injuries.\n\nSo, when the PTO is disengaged, the machine continues moving because of inertia. That's dangerous because it can lead to severe injuries or even death if not controlled properly. The danger is that the machine might fall over or move in an unsafe way without stopping.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, the machine will continue running due to inertia, posing a continued danger as it may fall over or move dangerously without stopping.\n\nAnswer: After disengaging the PTO shaft, the machine continues moving because of inertia, posing a dangerous risk.",

The first section seems to be about page 95, which has some technical information related to the spreader setup. Then, on page 96, there's another set of elements that include a \"Last setting check\" section. \n\nIn the \"Last setting check\" section under page 96, I see several items. One of them is a list of questions and answers about checking the settings. Specifically, one of those is: \"Did you set the height over the ground or crops to 75 cm?\" with an answer that says \"Yes.\" \n\nWait, but the question here is asking for the recommended height based on the last setting check. From the context, under page 96's Last Setting Check, it mentions a list of questions and answers. The relevant one is about checking if the spreader was set to 75 cm. So, according to that, the answer is yes, it was set correctly.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the recommended height based on the last setting check. I think the \"Last setting check\" section might be referring to a specific step where they verify if the spreader is at the correct height. The answer provided in that section says \"Yes,\" but perhaps more importantly, it's confirming that the height was set correctly.\n\nHowever, the question is about what the recommended height should be based on the last setting check. Since the last setting check confirms that the height was set to 75 cm, which is the required height, I think the answer is that the spreader must be set to 75 cm over the ground or crops.\n\nWait, but in the context provided, under page 96's Last Setting Check, it says: \"If you have not checked the control system settings correctly, perform a tray test to check the spreading pattern.\" So maybe the recommended height is determined by checking if the spreader is at 75 cm. \n\nBut I'm getting confused because the question is asking for the recommended height based on the last setting check. The answer provided in page 96's Last Setting Check says \"Yes,\" but perhaps more importantly, it confirms that the height was set correctly to 75 cm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at other sections. On page 95, there are some technical details about adjusting the spreader and using lift rods. But those don't seem directly related to the last setting check.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The last setting check confirms that the spreader was set correctly to 75 cm over the ground or crops. Therefore, the recommended height is 75 cm.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader must be set to a height of 75 cm according to the last setting check.\n\nAnswer: 75 cm",

In one part, it mentions \"If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg,\" which is under a section titled \"Working method on the headland.\" The text says that if the hopper content drops below 100 kg, the control system switches off automatic calibration and measures the distributed quantity. It also notes that this can cause inaccuracies because the weight in the hopper might increase during measurement.\n\nSo, the key point is that when hopper content is less than 100 kg, the system stops automatically.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section titled \"Border spreading\" which has several elements. The first thing I notice is that under this section, there are multiple text items and pictures. Each element seems to be related to how border spreading works in farming or agriculture.\n\nThe first function mentioned is about one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate. That's clear\u2014it's a method where you spread fertilizer from the edge inward using a specific tool called the hydraulic border spreading plate. The working width can also be adjusted, which adds flexibility.\n\nThen, there's another text item that says \"Direction (9) (yield setting)\" and mentions spreading more or less to the field edge. This seems related to adjusting the application rate beyond the spreader, affecting both cover and loss over the field edge.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something else. Let me check again. The text item under \"Direction (1) (environmental setting)\" talks about spreading less or more towards the field edge, which affects yield and loss. Similarly, Direction (9) is about spread more or less beyond the spreader.\n\nSo, putting it together, there are two main functions: one where you use the hydraulic border plate to spread from the edge inward, adjusting width, and another where you adjust the flow beyond the spreader for better coverage or yield control. That makes sense because border spreading is used in both crop rotation and pest control, so having these two methods allows farmers to optimize their application rates effectively.\n</think>\n\nThe two functions of border spreading are:\n1. One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate, which spreads from the edge inward.\n2. Yield setting by adjusting the flow beyond the spreader for better coverage or yield control.\n\nAnswer: The two functions are one-sided boundary spreading and yield setting.",

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see a section where page 107 has some information about the hydraulic border spreading plate. It mentions that if the maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environmental standards, then the quantity of fertilizer spread beyond the field edge must be no more than 10% of the distributed in the center behind the spreader. There's also a note saying to test the spreading pattern on page 84.\n\nThen, looking at page 108, which seems to be about procedures with the spreader, it lists several actions that can be taken when using the spreader. One of them is switching off the tractor and removing keys from the ignition. Another is engaging the parking brake. There's also a list of steps like disconnecting the right spreading disc, lowering the border plate, checking vanes against the spreader, adjusting based on the chart, starting again, switching control box, engaging PTO shaft, etc.\n\nAdditionally, page 109 talks about driving patterns and mentions that two different patterns can be used depending on the land situation. It also says to stop spreading immediately or disconnect the PTO shaft if there's a failure or stoppage.\n\nSo, putting this together, when the spreader fails or stops, the necessary actions are likely switching off the tractor, removing keys, engaging parking brake, disconnecting the right disc, lowering the border plate, checking vanes, adjusting settings based on the chart, starting again, and possibly stopping spreading. But since the question asks for two specific actions, I think the most critical ones would be switching off the tractor and engaging the parking brake.\n</think>\n\nThe two necessary actions when the spreader fails or stops are: (1) Switching off the tractor and removing keys from ignition; (2) Engaging the parking brake of the tractor.",

The software includes features like a three-point power lift of the tractor (Cat. II) with a linkage frame for tractors with Cat. III or trailer supplied. It also mentions that the machine is used for border spreading.\n\nIn another section under \"SectionHeaderItem\" labeled \"Border Spreading,\" it says \"Border spreading is possible by using the following:\" and lists several systems like Hydraulic border spreading plate, ExactLine border spreading system, and others. \n\nThe question is about diesel consumption when using GEOSPREAD. I don't see any information in the context that mentions diesel usage for GEOSPREAD specifically. The focus seems to be on how the machine spreads the fertiliser rather than its fuel consumption.\n\nSince there's no data provided about diesel consumption related to GEOSPREAD, I can't provide an accurate answer based on the given context. Therefore, I should respond with \"Unknown\" as there isn't enough information available.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks about diesel consumption for GEOSPREAD but no relevant data is present in the context. \n\nAnswer: [Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

It mentions fine dosing and fine application. The text says that fine application handle Normal dosing setting and Fine application handle Fine application setting are both mentioned. There are images for each setting.\n\nLooking at the fine dosing part: \"Fine dosing\" refers to a specific setting where the actuator is set in a particular position, allowing precise control over the application rate. The text also mentions that fine dosing can be adjusted with a lever per dosing unit and that it's used for low application rates.\n\nNow, regarding fine application, it seems like there are two options: Normal dosing setting and Fine application setting. The question is about whether \"fine application\" itself is more expensive than \"normal dosing.\" \n\nI don't see any information in the context that directly compares the cost of fine application versus normal dosing. Both settings are described as fine, but without explicit pricing data or comparison points, it's impossible to determine which is more expensive.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, I can't provide a precise answer about whether fine application is more expensive than normal dosing.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide information comparing the cost of fine application versus normal dosing.

You have to optimize the spreading pattern and overcome environmental pollution when adjusting the border spreading plate.\n\nThen, in section 28, there's another part about \"One-sided boundary spreading with ExactLine.\" It mentions that ExactLine is available for both right and left, and you can spread right up to the border using it. However, it also notes that ExactLine doesn't completely cover the field border without loss beyond the edge, which aligns with environmental standards.\n\nLooking at section 29, there's a mention of \"ExactLine\" again, but I don't see any information about one-sided boundary spreading here. So, based on sections 27 and 28, it seems that ExactLine is suitable for small gardens because it doesn't cause excessive loss beyond the border.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes, one-sided boundary spreading using ExactLine is suitable for small gardens.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading with ExactLine is suitable for small gardens as it avoids excessive loss beyond the field edge.",

It mentions that without an ISO terminal, a special cable (IsoMatch) can be used to connect to the control box.\n\nThe third section is numbered 32 and focuses on the ISO tractor with its own ISO terminal.

So, the answer should focus on the specific instruction about driving along the edge with the plate and adjusting the working width.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are: using the Hydraulic Border Spreading Plate for one-sided boundary spreading, driving from the field edge, sending fertilizer granules in a seven-sided pattern, and adjusting the spread width by moving the plate.\n</think>\n\nSeven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate is a method where you drive along the field edge and send fertilizer granules using the optional extra. The working width can be adjusted by changing the Hydraulic Border Spreading Plate.",

There could be hot or live parts! Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.\" This seems directly related because it warns against handling without proper precautions, which would include avoiding contact with hard objects.\n\nLooking further down in Section 114, there's a section called \"Damage\" where it mentions that damage to the vanes is often caused by a hard object. It also provides steps on how to examine the equipment and adapt the discharge point if needed. This reinforces the idea that a hard object is likely involved.\n\nAdditionally, under \"TextItem,\" there's a part about using in the field, which again points out that hard objects can cause damage.

I think it should be \"of the material manufacturer\" instead.\n\nSo, putting this together: if someone falls into the fertilizer and there's no physician available, they should wear protective clothing like gloves, shoes, and goggles. They must follow all safety instructions provided by the material manufacturer and avoid coming into contact with the materials directly. Also, it's important to inform their physician immediately so they can get proper medical attention.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing anything else in the context.

In the \"Preparation for winter storage\" section, there's a text item that says: \"It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.\"\n\nHmm, that's interesting. It mentions using grease and oil after cleaning to prevent damage. But I'm not sure if that's the specific paint needed.\n\nLooking further down, there are some pictures with images, but they don't provide any information on the paint type. The text also talks about maintenance intervals and repair damage safely without delay, mentioning placing the tractor and machine on a firm surface and switching off the PTO shaft to release pressure from the hydraulic system.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any mention of specific paints here. Maybe the answer is that no specific paint is needed because it's done through cleaning and lubrication? Or perhaps the answer is that any damaged paintwork can be repainted with a general repair paint or primer.\n\nBut looking back at the question, it asks for a specific paint to use on damaged paintwork. Since there's no mention of using a particular paint in the context provided, I might need to infer based on common practices. However, without explicit information about the type of paint required, it's hard to give a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that any damaged paint can be repainted with a specific primer or repair paint. But since the question asks for a specific paint, perhaps the answer is \"No specific paint is needed; use general repair paints.\"\n\nWait, but in the maintenance section, it mentions using grease and oil after cleaning to prevent damage. So maybe the answer is that any damaged paintwork should be painted with a specific type of paint or primer.\n\nBut I'm not sure if there's a standard paint for this purpose. Maybe the answer is \"No specific paint is needed; use general repair paints.\" But I'm not entirely confident because the context doesn't provide enough details about the required paint.\n</think>\n\nThe answer is that no specific paint is needed as it can be repaired with general repair paints after cleaning and lubrication.\n\nAnswer: No specific paint is needed; use general repair paints.",

The question is about ISOBUS compatibility, so I should look for any mentions of ISOBUS protocols here.\n\nLooking through the text, I notice a few parts related to ISO tractor connections and the IsoMatch control box. In section 32, under \"SectionHeaderItem\" with content \"ISO Match,\" there are several elements:\n\n1. **SectionHeaderItem** with content \"Tractor with IsoMatch\": This part talks about converting tractors without their own ISO terminals to work with the IsoMatch control box.\n\n2. **TextItem** with content \"The switching functions and data transfer between the tractor terminal or ISO control box and the machine are operated via the ISOBUS.\" It mentions that this is done through the ISOBUS protocol, specifically for fields where soil composition or deviating conditions need to be controlled.\n\n3. **SectionHeaderItem** with content \"ISOBUS functionality via IsoMatch\": This section explains how tractors without their own ISO terminals can work with IsoMatch, mentioning the extra sensor and cable required.\n\n4. **TextItem** with content \"The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM.\" It also mentions an extra sensor available for this purpose.\n\n5. **SectionHeaderItem** with content \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set\": This part talks about adding the IsoMatch power cable to non-ISO tractors, allowing them to function with the IsoMatch control box.\n\n6. **TextItem** with content \"The driving speed of your tractor (or your trailed machine) is transmitted via the ISOBUS to the IsoMatch.\" It also mentions using the IM Tellus Input for other connections.\n\n7. **SectionHeaderItem** with content \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set\": This part again discusses adding the IsoMatch power cable, which allows them to function with the IsoMatch control box.\n\n8. **TextItem** with content \"The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM.\" It also mentions an extra sensor available for this purpose.\n\n9. **SectionHeaderItem** with content \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set\": This part again discusses adding the IsoMatch power cable, which allows them to function with the IsoMatch control box.\n\n10. **TextItem** with content \"The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM.\" It also mentions an extra sensor available for this purpose.\n\nFrom all these sections, I can gather that ISOBUS is used in conjunction with the ISO Match system.

Let me start by looking through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each element in the context. The section header mentions \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine.\" That's about positioning but not directly about grease.\n\nLooking at the text items under \"Shortening the coupling shaft,\" there are two pictures with images. These don't mention anything about grease, so I can ignore them for now.\n\nNext, I see a list of instructions related to lifting the machine with the power lift and adjusting angles. Again, no mention of grease here.\n\nThen, in another section header, it says \"Always mount the check chains of the protection sleeves.\" This is about securing the protection sleeves but doesn't specify any grease type.\n\nLooking further down, there are some text items that talk about cutting off tubes to achieve 25 mm clearance. The user mentions deburr both ends and cleaning the coupling shaft. No mention of grease here either.\n\nI notice a list of operations like shortening the protection sleeves, applying grease, attaching check chains, etc., but none specifically address the type of grease for profiled tubes.\n\nWait, I see another part where it says \"The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30 degrees when lifted and 30 degrees when lowered.\" This might be related to how the tubes are positioned, but again, no mention of grease.\n\nI think I need to check if any of these elements directly state what type of grease is recommended. Scanning through everything, it seems none explicitly mention a specific grease type for profiled tubes. So maybe the answer is that no specific grease type is recommended, or perhaps it's not provided in the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an instruction I missed. Let me go back to the text items again. The only place where grease is mentioned is when applying it after cutting off the tubes and attaching check chains. But the question is about profiled tubes specifically, so unless there's a specific mention of a grease type for that part, I can't be certain.\n\nI think the safest answer here is to state that no specific grease type is recommended based on the provided context.\n</think>\n\n[No specific grease type is recommended for profiled tubes of the coupling shaft as it is not explicitly mentioned in the context.]",

There's a section titled \"Connecting to the tractor\" which has multiple items. \n\nIn that section, I see a list of pictures and text items.

Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the sections, none of them explicitly talk about \"hose coupling support.\" The closest is under \"Connecting to the tractor\" where it mentions connecting the power lift and other things but not specifically about coupling supports for hoses.\n\nSo perhaps the answer isn't directly provided in the context. But since I have to extract information from the given context, maybe I can infer based on the text. It says that when your machine has the ExactLine/Hydraulic border spreading plate, you connect the hydraulic hoses. That might imply that the coupling support is part of the setup for connecting these hoses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"hose coupling support\" refers to a specific component used in connecting hoses to the tractor's couplings.

The user is asking about the specific type of slug pellets used in a spreading chart example for Delicia Schnecken Linsen. \n\nLooking at the context provided, I see that there are several elements related to the spreader or application rate. For instance, \"525 rpm\" and \"950 rpm\" are mentioned as speeds. There's also a mention of \"12 m\" which could relate to the spreading width. Additionally, the text includes information about dosing settings like \"12+1 (= 13)\" and flowrate calculations such as \"3.7 kg/min\". \n\nThe question is specifically about the type of slug pellets used in the example. The context doesn't directly mention the type but does provide details on application rates and dosing. Since the user wants a precise answer, I should focus on what's most relevant to the spreader or application rate.\n\nI notice that \"525 rpm\" is a key speed mentioned, which might indicate the specific type of spreader used. This could be referring to a particular model or brand of the spreader. The other details like flowrate and width are more about how much is applied per minute but don't specify the type.\n\nSo, considering all this, the most precise answer would be \"525 rpm\" as it's directly tied to the spreader used in the example.\n</think>\n\nThe specific type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' slug pellets used for the spreading chart example were spreaders with a speed of 525 rpm.",

In section 71, under \"SectionHeaderItem\", there's a text item that says: \"Variable, externally driven application rate\". Then another text item mentions \"RS 232 connection\" on page 72. \n\nIn the text for RS 232, it explains that the control system provides options to spread a variable, externally driven application rate. It also notes that an external system can be used with the GPS system or through the IsoMatch control box. The connection is via RS 232, which uses a serial port.\n\nThe text then goes into more detail about the RS 232 plug and how it's connected to the control box. It mentions that the occupation of pins in the 9-point RS 232 plug are specified in the user manual of the IsoMatch control box. \n\nSo, the key point here is that the minimum baud rate isn't directly stated; instead, it refers to the connection method and the pin occupation details from the IsoMatch manual.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections about fertiliser handling. The section titled \"To be done before spreading\" has a paragraph that mentions fertilizer dust can blow indoors and cause damage if not contained properly. It also talks about using a hopper cover to close the air gaps. \n\nIn another part of the same section under \"SectionHeaderItem\", it says, \"Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings.\" This suggests that without proper filtering, fertilizer dust can cause blockage.\n\nAdditionally, there's a specific mention in the text: \"74\" is listed as a page number for technical specifications. The content under 74 includes sections about technical specifications and load platforms. It says, \"The position of the dosing units is displayed in the main screen on the control system.\" This part doesn't directly answer the question but provides context.\n\nLooking back at the text, I see that there's a list of items related to spreading, including mentions of hopper covers and manual filling with large bags. However, none of these explicitly mention the maximum chunk size or blockage prevention details.\n\nWait, in the \"To be done before spreading\" section, it says, \"Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings.\" This is a key point because it indicates that without proper filtering, dust can cause blockage. It also mentions using a hopper cover to close air gaps.\n\nSo, putting this together, the maximum acceptable chunk size would be determined by ensuring that the spreader is properly filtered with a hopper cover closed well. However, the exact size isn't specified in the text. Therefore, I might need to infer based on standard practices or common sizes used for fertiliser dust.\n\nTypically, fertiliser dust can vary in size, but to prevent blockage effectively, it's important to have sufficient coverage and proper filtering. Without specific instructions from the context, I might not be able to provide an exact maximum chunk size. However, if I recall correctly, some common sizes are around 10mm or larger, but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text doesn't mention a specific size, so maybe it's better to state that the maximum acceptable chunk size isn't specified in the context provided and instead recommend using a hopper cover for proper filtering. But since the question asks for the maximum chunk size, I might need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking again at the section about load platforms: \"A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags.\" This suggests that a certain height is required for manual filling. But this doesn't directly answer the chunk size.\n\nI think I might have missed something earlier. Let me check again. The text under \"To be done before spreading\" says, \"Fertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings.\" This indicates that without a hopper cover, dust can cause blockage. So, perhaps the maximum chunk size isn't specified but is determined by the need for proper filtering.\n\nGiven all this, I might have to conclude that while the exact size isn't provided in the context, it's recommended to use a hopper cover with sufficient coverage to prevent blockage. However, since the question asks for the maximum acceptable chunk size, and there's no specific number given, maybe the answer is that the chunk size should be as small as possible but still effective, perhaps around 10mm or larger.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should stick with the information provided. The text does mention that using a hopper cover can help prevent dust from blowing indoors, so perhaps the maximum acceptable chunk size isn't specified here. Therefore, without more specific instructions, it's hard to give an exact number.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer is not explicitly provided in the context but is recommended to use a hopper cover for proper filtering to prevent blockage.\n\nAnswer: The maximum acceptable chunk size isn't directly specified in the text; however, using a hopper cover can help prevent dust from blowing indoors.",

The context has a lot of information about setting up a spreader machine, including various settings and their descriptions. There are several sections that mention wind speed limits.\n\nI see two main parts under page 96: \"Last setting check\" and \"Are you working with the correct settings from the correct spreading chart.\" In both cases, there's a section header about wind speed. \n\nIn the \"Last setting check\" section, it says: \"Did you set the height over the ground or crops to 75 cm?\" And in the \"Are you working...\" section, it mentions: \"Did you set the correct vane combination mounted?\", but also includes a bullet point that says: \"Did you set the correct vane combination mounted?

The section where the tractor and machine are being transported is in the part labeled \"Preparing the machine to be transported.\" That's under page number 93. \n\nLooking at that section, there are several elements related to preparing the machine for transport. One of them is about checking whether the PTO shaft needs to be switched off. It mentions ensuring that the tractor cannot start when working on the machine and that it can't move, which could cause severe physical injury.\n\nAnother point is about checking the lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes are all properly attached and working. This ensures everything is in good working order before transport.\n\nThere's also a part where they check if the reflector, motor vehicle with limited speed (40 km/h), on the tractor, is hidden by the implement. They mention fitting an additional reflector at the back of the implement to improve visibility.\n\nAdditionally, it says that all folding parts and their locking devices should be checked. This includes things like hopper cover, exactLine, hydraulic border spreading plate, etc., ensuring they're in good condition.\n\nThen, there's a section about preparing the machine for transport itself. It mentions checking if the tractor and machine are roadworthy, which means they can operate on public roads. They also check that the lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes are all attached properly and working. This ensures everything is in good condition before moving forward.\n\nAnother point is about checking the run of quick coupling ropes of the power lift. They mention setting all parts of the machine and the tractor, especially the PTO shaft, hydraulics, wheels, and electric system, to transport mode. This step ensures that everything is set up correctly for transport without any issues.\n\nThey also check the weight distribution between front and rear axles, ensuring it's balanced. Mounting front weights if necessary, checking headroom of the combination, lowering the power lift if needed, locking the control lever while moving to prevent accidents, checking light working order, ensuring dosing units are closed, switching off the control box, removing dirt that could fall on the road, and securing lateral securing for a mounted machine.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the key points related to tire pressure are about checking the PTO shaft, hydraulics, wheels, electric system, and power lift. The answer should mention these aspects as they relate to transport mode preparation.\n\nI think the main recommendation is that the PTO shaft needs to be switched off during transport. This prevents the tractor from starting when working on the machine and ensures it can't move, which could cause injury. Additionally, all other parts like hydraulics, wheels, and electric system should be checked to ensure everything runs smoothly in transport mode.\n\nSo, the tire pressure range isn't directly mentioned, but the process of preparing the machine for transport does involve checking various components related to movement and safety.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended tire pressure range is not explicitly provided. However, during preparation for transport, it's important to switch off the PTO shaft, ensure hydraulics, wheels, and electric system are functioning properly, and check the power lift's quick coupling ropes.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question: \"What is the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate?\" Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each section of the context. The main sections are about different types of spreading methods like over-dosing, under-dosing, and border spreading. Each section has elements like page numbers, element types (like text items or picture items), content, and additional info.\n\nLooking at the border spreading section, which is around page 106-107. The text item says: \"Drive along the field edge when one-sided boundary spreading and send the flow of fertiliser granules with the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra). The working width on the side of the field edge can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate (optional extra).\" It also mentions that during border spreading, you should spread less to the field edge to compensate for a higher application rate. This is because spreading less reduces the loss over the field edge but may affect crop yield.\n\nWait, so the question is about the optimal speed reduction percentage. The text doesn't explicitly mention a specific percentage, just talking about reducing the spread. But in the context, it's more about the method of driving and adjusting the working width rather than a specific speed percentage. So maybe there isn't enough information to provide an exact percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check other sections for any mentions of speed reduction percentages. The over-dosing section talks about spreading less on one side during underdosing, but that's not related to border spreading. Similarly, the under-dosing section also doesn't mention speed changes.\n\nSo, it seems like the question is asking for a specific percentage, but in the provided context, there's no information about what percentage reduction in driving speed optimizes application rate during border spreading. Therefore, I can't extract an exact number from this context.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information on the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rates. It focuses more on methods of driving and adjusting working widths rather than precise speed adjustments.\n\nAnswer: [No specific percentage provided in the context.]",

The context has a section called \"Driving pattern\" which seems relevant because it talks about different driving scenarios and methods.\n\nLooking at the \"Driving pattern\" section under \"Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A)\", there's a bullet point that says: \"Remove the border spreading plate at the end of the first pass or raise the hydraulic border spreading plate, but disconnect the right spreading disc and close the dosing unit.\" \n\nThis part mentions removing the border spreading plate. I don't see any information about the distance tolerance here. It just talks about removing the plate.\n\nI also check other sections under \"Driving pattern\" for situations where field edge distance is mentioned. Under \"Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B)\", there's a bullet point: \"Drive up the second line 1 working width from the field edge.\" But this doesn't mention the distance tolerance either.\n\nSince I don't find any specific information about the distance tolerance when driving the first path, I can conclude that the question is based on an assumption or standard practice. However, without explicit data in the context, it's not possible to provide a precise answer. Therefore, I should respond with \"Unknown\" as there isn't enough information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific distance tolerance values for driving 'first path' when border spreading is applied.

The user is asking about how many operational hours 'vanes' can typically last before needing replacement. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the context provided. Scanning through each element, I see that there are sections for maintenance intervals and specific elements like \"Lubricating points\" and \"Discharge bushings.\" There's also a section about \"Maintenance intervals\" which includes a table with details about various parts.\n\nLooking at the \"Maintenance intervals\" section, specifically the part where it lists \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle,\" I see that there are 7 conditions listed. The last condition mentions \"126 grease nipples on the PTO shaft.\" \n\nI remember from previous knowledge that grease nipples are used to apply grease to parts like the agitator, which helps prevent fouling. The number of grease nipples can indicate how much grease is applied. In this case, 126 grease nipples suggest a high level of grease coverage.\n\nTypically, in machinery maintenance, if you have too many grease nipples, it might mean that the part has been over-maintained or there's an issue like excessive grease causing damage. However, without specific information on when exactly to replace them, I can't give an exact operational hour. But based on the number of grease nipples, 126 seems high for a single part, which might indicate it needs immediate attention.\n\nSo, putting this together, while there's no direct data on how many hours 'vanes' last before replacement, the presence of 126 grease nipples suggests that they may need to be replaced sooner rather than later. Therefore, I can conclude that 'vanes' typically require replacement after a certain period, but without specific operational hour information, it's best to state that more grease nipples indicate potential for early replacement.\n</think>\n\nThe number of grease nipples on the agitator suggests a high level of grease coverage, which may indicate the need for immediate attention.

The image is labeled as \"Metal seal ring,\" which suggests that these are metal parts. But I should check if there's any text indicating the material.\n\nIn the section about replacing the agitator axle seal, under \"TextItem,\" it says \"140\" again. That might be a page number or an item number. The text also mentions that the agitator axle is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent granule loss. So, maybe the metal seal rings are different from the plastic ones.\n\nWait, but in the context provided, I don't see any mention of metal rings being used for sealing. Instead, it's all about plastic. The text says \"plastic seal\" on page 140. So perhaps the 'metal seal rings' aren't mentioned here because they're not part of that specific section.\n\nLooking back at the context, I don't see any mention of metal seal rings in relation to agitator axle seal. All the information is about plastic seals and instructions for replacing the agitator axle. Therefore, it's possible that 'metal seal rings' aren't present or relevant here based on the given text.\n\nSo, putting this together, I think the answer should be that there are no metal seal rings mentioned in the context provided. The only mention is of a plastic seal.\n</think>\n\nThe material for the 'metal seal rings' isn't specified in the context as they aren't present or relevant to the agitator axle seal.\n\nAnswer: There are no metal seal rings mentioned in the context.",

        "question": "What specific 'extension cable' length in meters is optimal for ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection?",
        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question: \"What specific 'extension cable' length in meters is optimal for ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection?\" Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context. The context has a section where it talks about cables related to ISO 11786 connections. Specifically, there's a cable with 7-point plugs for ISO 11786 in the cab connection. That seems relevant because the question is about an extension cable for that setup.\n\nLooking at the details under \"Cable with 7-point plugs for ISO 11786 in cab connection,\" it mentions that this cable can be used when the tractor doesn't have an ISOBUS connection. It also says that you can mount an optional extension cable to the \"Input IM Tellus\" cable, which is supplied as a standard item.\n\nWait, but the question is about the optimal length for ISO 11786 in cab. The context mentions that this cable has 7-point plugs and is used when there's no ISOBUS connection. It doesn't specify the length, though. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me check again. The section says: \"Cable with 7-point plugs for ISO 11786 in cab connection.\" That's it. No mention of the length. So perhaps the optimal length isn't specified here? Or maybe it's implied by the type of plug?\n\nWait, no, the question is about the extension cable length. Since the context doesn't provide a specific length for this particular cable, I might need to infer or check if there's any standard information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7-point plugs are standard and don't require a specific length beyond what's provided by the manufacturer. If that's the case, perhaps the optimal length isn't specified because it's a standard plug set.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the context, I see another section about \"Extended ISO cable.\" It mentions that this is available for a tractor-trailed spreader and replaces the short cable fitted. So maybe the 7-point plug cables are part of the extended setup?\n\nWait, no, the question is specifically about the extension cable length for ISO 11786 in cab. The context doesn't mention any specific lengths for that cable beyond what's described as a standard item.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that there isn't enough information provided to specify an optimal length because it's a standard plug set, or maybe the length isn't critical since it's optional and can be added as needed.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm supposed to provide an exact number, but the context doesn't give one, then maybe the answer is that no specific length is required beyond what's provided by the 7-point plugs. Or perhaps the optimal length isn't applicable here because it's a standard setup.\n\nWait, let me check again. The question is about the extension cable for ISO 11786 in cab. The context mentions that this cable can be used when there's no ISOBUS connection and that optional cables are available. It doesn't specify any length beyond what's provided by the plug set.\n\nSo maybe the answer is that the optimal length isn't specified because it's a standard plug, or perhaps the question expects an answer based on standard lengths for such connections. But without specific information in the context, I can't provide an exact number.\n\nWait, but looking back at the context, under \"Cable with 7-point plugs for ISO 11786 in cab connection,\" it says that this is a standard item and optional extension cables are available. So perhaps the optimal length isn't required because it's a standard setup without needing to specify a particular length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an answer based on standard lengths for such connections, but since I don't have specific information, I might need to state that no specific length is provided and that optional cables can be added as needed.\n\nBut wait, in the context, it's mentioned that this cable has 7-point plugs. So perhaps the optimal length isn't specified because it's a standard plug set without any particular length requirement beyond what's given by the manufacturer.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the answer is that no specific length is provided for the extension cable in question, as it's a standard plug set and optional cables can be added.\n</think>\n\nNo specific length is provided for the extension cable in ISO 11786 in cab connection since it's a standard plug set.",

I need to find the duration of the free test period for 'GEOCONTROL software' user licence.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each section in the context. There are three main sections: Spreader control software, IsoMatch Grip, and Site-dependent control. Each has several sub-elements.\n\nLooking at the IsoMatch Grip section, there's a text item that says \"A user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop which, after the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with\". This seems relevant because it mentions the free test period for the software. \n\nIn the Spreader control software section, under 'Accessories', there's a text item that says \"A user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop which, after the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with\". This reinforces the information from the previous section.\n\nThe Site-dependent control section also has a text item stating the same thing: \"A user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop which, after the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with\".\n\nSo, all these sections are consistent in saying that the free test period is part of purchasing the software. The duration isn't specified here, only that it's included within the licence purchase.\n\nTherefore, the answer should state that the free test period is included when purchasing the 'GEOCONTROL software' user licence.\n</think>\n\nThe free test period for 'GEOCONTROL software' includes a duration that allows your machine to work with the licence purchased from IsoMatch.",
