        "model_answer": "The text does not provide a clear and concise answer to the question. However, I can try to help you rephrase or rephrase the question to get a more specific and accurate answer.\n\nTo answer your question, here is a revised version:\n\nWhen using nitrate-containing fertilizer on the machine, it's essential to take precautions to avoid physical injury. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. When handling fertiliser and other materials, wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions.\n2. Avoid contact with fertiliser and other material when adjusting and testing the spreader. The risk of injury from coming into contact with fertiliser and other material can be high if you don't take necessary precautions.\n\n3. When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.\n4. Never try to stop a leak with your fingers. Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions.\n\n5. Be careful that nothing gets jammed while adjusting and checking the spreader. Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions.\n6. Avoid contact with fertiliser and other material when working on the hydraulic system. The risk of injury from coming into contact with fertiliser and other material can be high if you don't take necessary precautions.\n\n7. When operating the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage. All hoses, piping and connecting points must be checked regularly, but at least once a year, by an expert for leakages or visible damage! The lifespan of a hose should be 6 years maximum (see the production date on the hoses).",

However, based on the context provided, I can try to provide a more detailed response.\n\nTo answer the question, the correct procedure for checking and maintaining the dosing mechanism is:\n\n1. Check the hydraulic system regularly.\n2. Check the level of the grease in the gearbox below the spreading discs. The level of the grease should be 35 mm when the machine has been standing still for a short time.\n3. Check the nuts and bolts regularly to prevent damage to the machine and possible injury, especially after maintenance.\n4. Use a feeler gauge to measure the distance between the inside of the rope and the opening of the discharge bushing carefully.\n5. If the measured distance is more or less than 1.0 mm, do the following:\na. Check the nuts and bolts regularly to prevent damage to the exterior.\n6. Check the hydraulic system (hoses, pipes, connections). All hoses, piping and connecting points must be checked regularly, but at least once a year, by an expert for leakages or visible damage.\n7. Damaged or old parts must be replaced with new ones that comply with the technical specifications of the manufacturer of the machine. Damage to the hydraulic system could lead to injury.\n8. Use the correct grease when replacing hoses. Hoses must be placed and mounted in the proper way. Be careful not to change the connections. Replaced hoses must be suitable to the permitted work pressure and be resistant to chemical, mechanical and thermal loads.\n9. Check the connections between the central gearbox and the spreading discs. The level of the grease under the filler opening must be 35 mm when the machine has been standing still for a short time.\n10. Clean the machine before using the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage.\n11. Use the correct grease when adjusting and testing the spreader. Hoses must be placed and mounted in the proper way. Be careful not to change the connections. Replaced hoses must be suitable to the permitted work pressure and be resistant to chemical, mechanical and thermal loads.\n12. Check the settings of the dosing mechanism, check the discharge point, as described in the instructions.\n13. If the distance is not equal all over the position of the dosing plate, change the dosing opening if necessary, as the difference in the application rate is more than 3% it could be caused by a difference in position of the discharge point with regards to the spreading disc between the left and right sides. The distance between the inside of the rope and the opening of the discharge bushing must be 109 mm when the machine has been standing still for a short time.\n14. Clean the machine before using the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage.\n15. Use the correct grease when replacing hoses. Hoses must be placed and mounted in the proper way. Be careful not to change the connections. Replaced hoses must be suitable to the permitted work pressure and be resistant to chemical, mechanical and thermal loads.\n16. Check the settings of the dosing mechanism, check the discharge point, as described in the instructions.\n17. If the distance is too great, the fertiliser does not flow through the discharge point onto a random point below the discharge bushing. This results in a disrupted spreading pattern.\n18. Clean the machine before using the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage.\n19. Use the correct grease when adjusting and testing the spreader.
