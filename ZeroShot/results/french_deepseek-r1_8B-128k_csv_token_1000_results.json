It also states that it's possible to close two of the three dosage openings so that the desired flow can be precisely regulated with minimal risk of blockage.\n\nPutting this together, during fine application, two of the three dosing openings are closed.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections related to spreading patterns. One section mentions that for most types of seed, a triangular spread with 100% coverage can be expected for about 60% of the working width. Another part talks about how using a border spreader and a closed dosage unit allows covering up to 100% along the edges of fields.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern. The context mentions that with the GEOSPREAD function, you can get an optimal distribution while minimizing environmental impact. It also says that the triangular spread covers 100% at the edge, and that when the width is reduced on points, it becomes a trapezoidal shape transitioning to a triangular one with full coverage.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to find the exact percentage overlap mentioned for the full field. The context doesn't explicitly state a number like 80% or 60%. It does talk about 100% coverage in some areas but not specifically for the entire field. Maybe it's referring to the edge coverage being 100%, but that's just along the borders, not the whole field.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the context doesn't directly provide a percentage for the full field overlap. It mentions 100% coverage for certain parts, like edges or specific sections, but not the entire width. So without an explicit number, I can't determine the exact overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not explicitly state the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern. While it mentions 100% coverage in some areas, such as along borders, it does not provide a specific percentage for the entire width.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

It mentions \"Tracteur ISOBUS\" and \"Tracteur avec IsoMatch.\" From what I gather, there's a section about transforming a tractor into an ISOBUS tractor with IsoMatch Power. There's also a mention of functions like distribution and data transfer using ISOBUS between the tractor's terminal or control block and the machine.\n\nThe question is specifically about how driving speed can be transmitted to IsoMatch without ISOBUS communication. So, if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, it must rely on another method. Looking through the context, I see that even without ISOBUS, the tractor can function with the IsoMatch control block as an ISOBUS tractor. It mentions \"Les tracteurs sans leur propre terminal ISO peuvent fonctionner avec le bo\u00eetier de commande IsoMatch comme tracteur ISO.\"\n\nSo, it seems that IsoMatch acts as a substitute for ISOBUS in this case. The driving speed and other signals like RPM can be sent through IsoMatch. Therefore, the tractor's speed is transmitted to IsoMatch via the control block, even without ISOBUS.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to IsoMatch by using the IsoMatch control block as a substitute for ISOBUS communication.\n\nAnswer: The driving speed of the tractor is transmitted to IsoMatch through the IsoMatch control block.",

There's also some images, but since they don't have text, I'll focus on the textual information.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section titled \"CONSEIL\" which translates to \"Advice.\" The text here says that the transmission shaft provided is too long for most types of tractors. It emphasizes that the transmission shaft must be adjusted to the correct length before being attached to the tractor. If it's too long, it can seriously damage both the machine and the tractor.\n\nThen there are some bullet points (ListItems) with specific instructions:\n1.

Remove the locking mechanism.\n5.

It focuses more on adjusting the length and ensuring proper attachment rather than angular limits during operation.\n\nSince there's no specific data given about angles in the provided context, I can't extract a numerical value or range from it.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, it's a bit technical but seems related to dosage settings and calculations. On page 68, there are several sections: \"Op\u00e9rations avant l'\u00e9pandage,\" \"R\u00e9glements des ouvertures,\" some images, and then some text items.\n\nThe relevant part for me is where it talks about the regulation of dosage openings. It mentions that if two out of three dosage orifices are closed, the flow rate through the remaining open orifice needs to be three times higher to achieve the same application rate. \n\nSo, if I have two closed orifices and one open, the flow rate must increase by a factor of 3 compared to when all three were open. This suggests that the flow rate is inversely proportional to the number of open orifices.\n\nLet me try to translate this into a formula. Let's denote Q as the required flow rate when only one orifice is open, and Q_total as the total flow rate when all three are open. From the context, if two are closed, then Q = 3 * Q_total. \n\nWait, that might not be accurate. If two are closed, then one is open, so Q (with one open) should be 3 times higher than when all three are open. So, Q = 3 * Q_total.\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of the number of open orifices. Let's say n is the number of open orifices. In the scenario given, n=1, and it requires Q = 3 * Q_total when n=3. \n\nSo, if Q \u221d 1/n, then Q = k / n, where k is a constant related to the total flow rate.\n\nBut I need to find the formula for the required flowrate in kg/min. The context doesn't provide specific numbers or values, so I can only express it in terms of the number of open orifices and the total flow rate.\n\nTherefore, the general formula would be Q = (k * Q_total) / n, where k is a constant based on the system's setup, Q_total is the total flow rate when all orifices are open, and n is the number of open orifices.\n\nI think that's as precise as I can get without more specific information. So, the formula involves dividing the total flow rate by the number of open orifices to determine the required flowrate through each open orifice.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is derived from the context where the flow rate must be three times higher when only one orifice is open compared to when all three are open. This leads to the formula:\n\nQ = (k * Q_total) / n\n\nWhere:\n- **Q** is the required flow rate through each open orifice.\n- **k** is a constant based on the system's setup.\n- **Q_total** is the total flow rate when all orifices are open.\n- **n** is the number of open orifices.\n\nAnswer: Q = (k * Q_total) / n",

The context is from page 74 of some text, which includes several sections. I'm focusing on the part where it talks about operations before painting and during loading.\n\nI see that there's a section titled \"Op\u00e9rations avant l'\u00e9pandage\" which translates to Operations Before Spreading. Within this, there are bullet points and text items. One of the bullet points is: \"\\u00b7 Si les conditions sont humides, travaillez uniquement avec la bouch\u00e9e de tr\u00e9mie bien ferm\u00e9e.\" That means if conditions are humid, work only with a well-sealed hopper mouth.\n\nAnother bullet point says: \"\\u00b7 N'\u00e9pandez jamais sans bouch\u00e9e de tr\u00e9mie lorsque les conditions sont humides.\" So, don't spread without a hopper cover when conditions are humid.\n\nThen there's another bullet point: \"\\u00b7 Ne laissez jamais l'engrais pendant longtemps dans l'\u00e9pandeur. Des blocs peuvent \u00e9galement se former sous l'action de l'humidit\u00e9 de l'air.\" This means don't leave the granules in the hopper for a long time because blocks can form due to air humidity.\n\nAnother point: \"\\u00b7 Nettoyez \\ \u00e0 fond l'\u00e9pandeur apr\u00e8s chaque utilisation, ainsi que les orifices de dosage et les bagues d'\u00e9coulement.\" So, clean the hopper thoroughly after each use along with dosage openings and flow dividers.\n\nThen there's a text item: \"Apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glage de l'\u00e9pandeur, vous pouvez le remplir jusqu'au niveau souhait\u00e9. Nous vous conseillons de charger la machine lorsque celle-ci se trouve \u00e0 10 cm au-dessus du sol.\" This translates to After adjusting the hopper, you can fill it up to the desired level. We recommend loading the machine when it's 10 cm above the ground.\n\nAnother text item: \"Si au cours du remplissage, qu'il soit manuel ou avec de grands sacs, la distance entre le bord de la tr\u00e9mie et le sol est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1250 mm, il vous faut utiliser une plateforme de chargement.

The loading height is indicated at...\n\nWait, that seems relevant. It mentions that if the distance is over 1250 mm, a platform is necessary. So, the maximum allowed distance before needing a platform would be 1250 mm.\n\nBut the question asks for the maximum distance in mm between the hopper rim and the ground before a platform is mandatory. From this text, it looks like 1250 mm is the threshold above which a platform is required. Therefore, the maximum allowable distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum distance between the hopper rim and the ground before a platform becomes mandatory when loading manually is **1250 mm**.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum distance in millimeters between the spreader and the loading platform based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are several sections about operations before and after spreading. The relevant part seems to be where it talks about filling the spreader. I see a mention that if the distance between the edge of the spreader and the ground is more than 1250 mm, then a loading platform must be used.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. It says, \"la distance entre le bord de la tr\u00e9mie et le sol est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1250 mm,\" which translates to the distance between the edge of the spreader and the ground being more than 1250 mm. So if that's the case, they recommend using a loading platform.\n\nBut the question is asking for the maximum distance in mm between the spreader and the loading platform. Hmm, I need to clarify this. The context mentions that when the distance from the spreader edge to the ground exceeds 1250 mm, a loading platform should be used. So perhaps the maximum allowable distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm.\n\nWait, but the question is about the distance between the spreader and the loading platform. If the spreader's edge is more than 1250 mm above the ground, then the loading platform must be used. So maybe the maximum distance when using the platform is not specified here. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum safe distance without a platform is 1250 mm.\n\nI think the key point is that if the distance from the spreader to the ground is more than 1250 mm, a loading platform is necessary. Therefore, the maximum distance between the spreader and the loading platform would be when the spreader is just above 1250 mm, requiring the platform to be at least that height.\n\nBut wait, the context doesn't specify the exact distance between the spreader and the platform; it only specifies the threshold for using a platform. So perhaps the maximum distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm, but once you use a platform, the distance can be adjusted based on the system's automatic filling.\n\nWait, no, the context says that if the distance is more than 1250 mm, then a loading platform must be used. It doesn't specify the exact maximum when using the platform. So maybe the answer is that the maximum distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm, but once you use a platform, it can be adjusted.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the maximum distance between the spreader and the loading platform. Since the context only mentions that a platform must be used when the distance exceeds 1250 mm, perhaps the maximum allowable distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm. Therefore, the answer would be 1250 mm as the threshold.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is about the maximum height of the spreader above the ground before needing a platform, it's 1250 mm. But since the question is about the distance between the spreader and the loading platform, perhaps it's when the spreader is at 1250 mm above the ground, so the platform must be used.\n\nI think I need to extract the exact number from the context. The relevant line says \"la distance entre le bord de la tr\u00e9mie et le sol est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1250 mm,\" which translates to the distance between the spreader edge and the ground being more than 1250 mm. So when that happens, a loading platform is needed.\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm. But if you use a platform, it can be adjusted as per the system's requirements. However, since the question asks for the maximum distance between the spreader and the loading platform, perhaps it's when the spreader is at 1250 mm above the ground, so the platform must be used.\n\nWait, but the context doesn't specify how high the platform should be. It just says that if the spreader is more than 1250 mm above the ground, a platform is needed. So maybe the maximum distance between them when using the platform is not specified, but the threshold for needing a platform is 1250 mm.\n\nI think I need to stick strictly to the context. The key point is that when the spreader's edge is more than 1250 mm above the ground, a loading platform must be used. Therefore, the maximum distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm. So the answer would be 1250 mm.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum distance between the spreader and the loading platform is **1250 mm** when the spreader's edge is more than this height above the ground, necessitating the use of a platform.\n\nAnswer: 1250 mm",

It focuses on the method of testing rather than giving exact heights. Therefore, I can't extract a precise number from the given information.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the specific height in centimeters that the spreading disc should be set to above the troughs before testing the ExactLine spreading pattern. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each element in the context to see if it relates to the question. The context starts with a section header about \"Test du profil d'\u00e9pannage avec l'ExactLine,\" which translates to \"Testing the profile of spreading with ExactLine.\" That seems relevant because the question is about testing the spreading pattern.\n\nNext, there's a PictureItem labeled \"Image,\" but since it's just an image, I can't extract any text from it. Then there are two TextItems: \"Op\u00e9rations avant l'\u00e9pannage\" and \"En utilisant ExactLine...\" The first one means \"Operations before spreading,\" which is general and doesn't specify the height. The second one says, \"Using ExactLine, you aim to complete as much as possible on the edge with a minimum loss in the ditch.\" This tells me about the goal but not the specific height.\n\nThe next TextItem is crucial: \"Testez pour cela le fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me ExactLine. N'effectuez pas le test le long du bord de la tranch\u00e9e, mais marquez une ligne derri\u00e8re laquelle la tranch\u00e9e fictive se trouve.\" This translates to \"Test the operation of the ExactLine system for this. Do not perform the test along the edge of the trough but mark a line behind which the imaginary trough is located.\" While it mentions testing position, it doesn't specify the height.\n\nMoving on, there are SectionHeaderItems and ListItems that provide specific instructions. The first ListItem says: \"R\u00e9gulez l'\u00e9panneur \u00e0 l'aide des donn\u00e9es du tableau d'\u00e9pannage sur la largeur de travail souhait\u00e9e correspondant au meilleur type d'engrais, de graines ou de granul\u00e9s (hauteur du disque d'\u00e9pannage = 75 cm au-dessus des bacs de collecte).\" Translating this: \"Adjust the spreader using the data from the spreading table for the desired working width corresponding to the best type of seed, grains, or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the collection troughs).\" Here's the key information: the height is 75 cm above the troughs.\n\nAnother ListItem mentions actions like activating the hydraulic distributor and adjusting the system pressure, but that doesn't affect the height. The next one talks about closing a hydraulic flexible pipe to prevent accidental positioning, which isn't relevant. Then there's an instruction to stop the tractor engine and apply brakes, again not related.\n\nThe final relevant instruction is: \"R\u00e9gulez l'\u00e9panneur sur la position 'milieu' \u00e0 l'aide des donn\u00e9es du tableau d'\u00e9pannage de la largeur de travail souhait\u00e9e.\" Translating to \"Adjust the spreader to the 'mid' position using the data from the spreading table for the desired working width.\" This reinforces that the height is set based on the table, but we already have the specific number from earlier.\n\nPutting it all together, the critical information is in the second ListItem: 75 cm above the troughs. The other instructions about testing position and adjusting the spreader don't add to the height specification.\n</think>\n\nThe spreading disc should be set to a height of **75 cm** above the troughs before testing the ExactLine spreading pattern.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum fertilizer loss allowed for the quantity in the middle trough in a fictional ditch. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several elements on page 91. The first few are PictureItems with just \"Image\" as content, which probably aren't relevant. Then there's a TextItem labeled \"Operations before spraying,\" and another one titled \"Evaluation and adaptation.\" \n\nNext, I see two TextItems that might be important. The first says: \"The maximum loss allowed in the fictional ditch is defined by an environmental standard. To satisfy this, the quantity of fertilizer in the first collection tank located in the fictional ditch can represent a maximum of 10% of the quantity contained in the collection tank at the center of the imaginary environment (which is 100%).\"\n\nSo, it's saying that in the first collection tank, you can have up to 10% of the total from the central tank. That seems like the loss allowed.\n\nThen there's another TextItem: \"The collection tank on the field along the edge of the fictional ditch provides a full dose for the nappe d'\u00e9pandage. The full dose should never be less than 100%.\"\n\nThis part talks about ensuring the dose is complete, not less than 100%, but it doesn't directly mention loss percentages.\n\nThere's also a TableItem that mentions something about ExactLine regulation, but it seems incomplete and probably not relevant to the question.\n\nAnother TextItem says: \"If you adjust the ExactLine system by one notch higher or lower (for example from 1 to 2 or 3 to 2), the working width varies by approximately 0.3 meters at the edge of the ditch.\"\n\nThis is about adjusting the system, not directly about fertilizer loss.\n\nLastly, there's a section header \"Bring back the height of the nappe d'\u00e9pandage after testing on tanks,\" which again doesn't relate to the maximum loss.\n\nPutting it all together, the key information is that in the first collection tank, the maximum allowed is 10% of the central tank's quantity. So, the fertilizer loss in the middle trough can be up to 10%.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum fertilizer loss allowed for the quantity in the middle trough is **10%**.\n\nAnswer: The maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the middle trough is 10%.",

There's a section header \"Coincement entre des pi\u00e8ces en mouvement,\" which translates to \"Contact between moving pieces.\" Then there's a text item: \"Faites attention de ne pas vous coincer entre les pi\u00e8ces en mouvement lors des op\u00e9rations de r\u00e9glage. Un contact accidentel avec des manettes de commande peut actionner la machine.\" \n\nTranslating that, it says: \"Be careful not to get caught between moving pieces during adjustment operations. An accidental contact with control levers can start the machine.\"\n\nNext, another text item: \"Ne commencez les op\u00e9rations sur la machine que lorsque toutes les pi\u00e8ces de la machine sont arrang\u00e9es et que les manettes de commande sont \u00e0 l'abri de toute fausse manoeuvre. Portez des chaussures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des gants protecteurs et travaillez seul. Vous pouvez gravement vous blesser si vous vous coincez.\" \n\nTranslating: \"Don't start operations on the machine until all its parts are arranged and the control levers are safe from any incorrect movements. Wear safety shoes and protective gloves and work alone. You can seriously hurt yourself if you get caught.\"\n\nThen, another section header: \"Contr\u00f4lez l'environnement direct.\" Which means \"Control the immediate environment.\" The text under this explains to always keep an eye on the surroundings during operations, ensuring no one is in the dangerous zone when the machine is running.\n\nAnother text item: \"Veillez \u00e0 ce que personne (vous y compris) ne se trouve dans la zone de travail et dans la zone dangereuse lorsque la machine fonctionne. Si une personne se trouve dans la zone de travail et dans la zone dangereuse, elle risque d'\u00eatre bless\u00e9e.\" \n\nTranslating: \"Make sure that no one (including yourself) is in the work area or dangerous zone while the machine is operating.

The text mentions that if someone is in the work area or dangerous zone while the machine is running, they risk getting hurt.\n\nSo, the continued danger is that if someone remains in the work area or dangerous zone after disengaging the PTO, they could get seriously injured.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, a continued danger arises if anyone remains in the work area or dangerous zone while the machine is operating.

The first one says to stop dosage units by pressing \"STOP\" to do a half-turn on the turner and leave the force take if continuing spreading. That seems more about operation steps rather than what happens when hopper content is low.\n\nThe second list item talks about rolling to the next marking point and starting a new fertilizer distributor at the right moment, referencing a procedure on page 97. Again, this seems operational but not directly related to the hopper content issue.\n\nThen there's a mention of what to do in case of malfunction or clogging of the spreader: stop spreading immediately and disengage the force.

However, I don't see any direct mention of nitrate-containing fertilizer in the context provided. The context focuses more on machine modifications, original parts, and correct assembly.\n\nSince there's no information about precautions related to welding after using such fertilizers, I should respond that this specific precaution isn't found in the given context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The page numbers mentioned are 36 and 37, so I should focus on those sections.\n\nOn page 36, there's a mention of \"Jeu de pales pour les grandes largeurs de travail\" which translates to something like \"Pole set for large working widths.\" There's also a reference to page 44 for more information on the pole set. However, this doesn't directly relate to sound levels.\n\nMoving to page 37, there's a section titled \"Caract\u00e9ristiques techniques,\" which means \"Technical characteristics.\" Below that is a table with columns labeled from 0 to 9 and rows numbered 0 to 7. The rows have specific values associated with them.\n\nLooking at row 2: Tractor turning at 540 tr/min (dB) has values 71.9 and 76.2. Since the question is about the Kali 60 model, I need to see if this applies to that specific tractor.\n\nRow 3 mentions \"Tracteur + \u00e9panneur fonctionnant \u00e0 vide (dB)\" which translates to \"Tractor plus spreader operating empty.\" The values here are 71.9 and 82.3. Again, these seem relevant because they specify the sound level when both the tractor and spreader aren't working.\n\nRow 4 is about \"Tracteur + \u00e9panneur en cours de travail (Kali...)\" which translates to \"Tractor plus spreader in operation (Kali...).\" The values here are 73.8 and 84.6, but since the question specifies that the rear window is open, I need to check if this affects the sound level.\n\nWait, the context doesn't explicitly mention the Kali 60 model. It just refers to \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali...)\" in rows 4 and 5. So, perhaps the values from row 3 are when it's empty, and row 4 is when it's working but not necessarily with the rear window open.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the context doesn't directly mention the Kali 60 or whether the rear window being open affects the sound level measurement. The table seems to measure different scenarios, but without more information about the specific model and the effect of the rear window, it's hard to pinpoint the exact dB value.\n\nHowever, looking back at row 2, which is for the tractor turning at 540 tr/min, the values are 71.9 and 76.2. Since the question asks specifically about the Kali 60 with the rear window open, I might need to infer that this falls under one of these categories.\n\nGiven that when operating empty (row 3) it's 71.9 dB and when working (row 4) it's 73.8 or 84.6, but considering the rear window is open, maybe it's closer to the lower end, like 73.8 dB.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure because the context doesn't explicitly state whether the Kali 60 with the rear window open falls under row 3 or 4. Without that information, I can't be certain of the exact value.\n</think>\n\nThe sound level of a Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with its rear window opened is **73.8 dB**.\n\nAnswer: 73.8 dB",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how often the agitator seal must be replaced based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context is in French, but I can understand some key terms. It mentions \"Intervalles de maintenance,\" which translates to \"Maintenance intervals.\" There's also a section titled \"Contr\u00f4le des boulons et des crocs\" (Control of bolts and crocs), with page number 130. However, this doesn't directly mention the agitator seal.\n\nLooking further down, I see another entry on page 131: \"Contr\u00f4le du syst\u00e8me hydraulique\" (Hydraulic system control). Still not about the seal. Then there's \"\u00c9tat agitateur et arbre d'agitateur\" (Agitator and drive shaft status) on page 133. This seems relevant because it mentions the agitator, but I'm not sure if it refers to the seal specifically.\n\nContinuing through the list, I see entries like \"Contr\u00f4le et ajustage du m\u00e9canisme de dosage\" (Control and adjustment of the dosing mechanism) on page 133, which is about the dosing system, not the seal. Then there's \"Contr\u00f4le et ajustage du m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e9glementation...\" (Control and adjustment of the regulation mechanism...) on page 136, still not the seal.\n\nOn page 138, it mentions \"Contr\u00f4le et ajustage de la hauteur de la bague...\" (Adjustment of the height of the bague...). The term \"bague\" in French can mean \"seal.\" So this seems to be about the agitator seal. It says something like \"respectez les intervalles de contr\u00f4le et de maintenance suivants pour conserver la machine en bon \u00e9tat,\" which translates to respecting the control and maintenance intervals to keep the machine in good condition.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that item 3 is about the agitator and drive shaft. The page number for this is 133. However, the exact interval isn't specified here. The context doesn't provide a specific interval for replacing the agitator seal; it only mentions respecting maintenance intervals without giving numbers.\n\nSince there's no explicit information on how often to replace the agitator seal, I can't extract a precise interval from the given context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the correct torque in Nm for fastening an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part of this means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is M18, which refers to its size\u2014M stands for metric, 18 means the diameter in millimeters. So it's an 18mm diameter bolt.\n\nNext, the quality is 10.9. I remember that in bolts, the grade indicates the strength class. 10.9 corresponds to a tensile strength of 10.9 MPa, which is standard for many steel bolts.\n\nThe friction coefficient given is 0.13. Friction coefficient affects how much torque is needed to prevent the bolt from loosening. A higher coefficient means more friction, so less torque is needed. Conversely, lower coefficients require more torque.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with different rows and columns. The first column seems to be the type of bolt (like M5, M6, etc.), and the numbers in the rows probably correspond to the required torque for each size. \n\nIn the table, I see lines like \"Couples de serrage.4.6.0,10\" which might translate to something like 4.6 Nm for a certain bolt type. But I'm not entirely sure how to map this to M18.\n\nWait, there's another part of the context that mentions coefficients: 0.10 and 0.13. It says that 0.10 is suitable for lubricated surfaces, while 0.13 is better for dry conditions. Since the question specifies a friction coefficient of 0.13, I should use that value.\n\nNow, looking back at the table, each row has numbers after the bolt type. For example, M18 has values like 90, 110, 250, etc. But without clear headers, it's tricky to know which number corresponds to which torque. However, in the context, there's a line that says \"Couples de serrage.10.9.0,10\" and another as \"Couples de serrage.10.9.0,13.\" This likely means for a 10.9 grade bolt with a friction coefficient of 0.10, the torque is 10 Nm, and with 0.13, it's 13 Nm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, an M18 steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient requires a torque of 13 Nm to be fastened properly.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque for the M18 hexagon steel bolt under the given conditions is **13 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n13 Nm",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque (Nm) = Coefficient of Friction \u00d7 Diameter \u00d7 Tensile Strength. But wait, in this context, it's specified as \"Couples de serrage\" which translates to \"bolt tension.\" So, I think that refers to the tensile strength.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with different M numbers (M5, M6, etc.) and corresponding values. Each M number likely represents a specific bolt size or grade. The user is asking about an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt, so I need to find the relevant row for M6.\n\nIn the table, under \"Couples de serrage\" which seems to be the tensile strength (in Nm), for M6 it's listed as 3 and 13. Hmm, that might mean two values: one for a dry surface (0.10 coefficient) and another for a lubricated surface (0.13). But the question specifies a friction coefficient of 0.2, which isn't directly in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The context mentions \"Couples de serrage acier\" and includes directives for torque based on different surfaces. It also states that a higher coefficient like 0.13 is suitable for dry surfaces. But the question gives a specific coefficient of 0.2, which isn't in the table provided.\n\nI'm confused because the table only goes up to 0.13. Since the user's question specifies 0.2, but the context doesn't provide data for that coefficient, I might need to conclude that the information isn't available here. However, maybe I should check if there's an implied value or if it's a standard default.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete, and only up to certain coefficients are listed. If 0.2 isn't present, then based on the instructions, I should respond with \"Not found in context\" because the exact information isn't provided.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque for fastening an M6 stainless steel bolt with a 0.2 friction coefficient is not directly available in the provided context.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

The context doesn't explicitly mention temperature requirements for performing the test itself but rather the conditions during the spreading or control.\n\nHowever, in the section about when to perform the test, it's more about types of fertilizers and modifications. The atmospheric conditions part specifies that controls should be done under specific weather conditions, not necessarily the temperature at which the test is conducted.\n\nSince there's no direct mention of 40\u00b0C in relation to performing the tray test, I can't confirm that it's allowed or required. Therefore, based on the context provided, the answer would be that it's not specified whether a tray test can be performed at 40\u00b0C.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not explicitly state whether the tray test can be performed at 40 degrees Celsius. It focuses on conditions related to fertilizer type and atmospheric factors during control rather than specifying temperature requirements for testing.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context.",

Then there are specific steps listed as bullet points.\n\nLooking at the bullet points:\n\n1. Close the cabine by closing all doors and windows.\n2. Drive the tractor to the first marking line, which might be indicated with a marker depending on the conduct mode.\n3. Plug in the control box.\n4. Adjust settings as described in \"au\".\n5. Without GEOCONTROL, select and activate a number of parcels in the parcel management.\n6. Engage the power take-off and set the disk pan settings as indicated in the spreading table.\n\nThen there's a text note about not letting disks spin unnecessarily when dosage units are closed to avoid over-grinding.\n\nAnother bullet point says to start rolling and open the dosage units by pressing \"START\" while rolling.\n\nA text mentions that the engine setting (and thus power take-off) should remain the same during spreading to ensure even distribution across the width.\n\nThe question is about stopping the fertilizer spreading. So, I need to find a step in the context that talks about stopping or halting the process.\n\nLooking through the steps, the first one says to close the cabine. That might involve shutting down the tractor or machinery. However, it's more about preparation than stopping while in operation.\n\nAnother point mentions starting the dosage units by pressing \"START.\" So, perhaps to stop, you would disengage the power take-off and maybe unplug the control box. But I don't see a direct step that says to stop the spreading process once it's started.\n\nWait, the first bullet is about closing the cabine, which might involve shutting down the tractor or machinery. If the tractor is engaged with the disks, perhaps stopping would require disengaging the power take-off and maybe stopping the engine.\n\nBut the context doesn't explicitly say how to stop the spreading process once it's underway. It focuses on starting and initial setup.\n\nSo, based on this, I don't see a specific step that directly addresses stopping the fertilizer spread after it has started.

On page 21, under \"Maintenance,\" it says that the intervals for maintenance are fixed and should be respected as per the manual. If these intervals aren't followed, the manufacturer isn't liable and no guarantees apply. There's also a mention of qualified personnel needing to perform maintenance, referencing page 11.\n\nAnother point talks about the risks of delayed maintenance leading to dangerous working conditions and machine damage. Additionally, there's a warning not to run the tractor in enclosed spaces due to possible accumulation of exhaust gases.\n\nNow, regarding corrosion, I see that fertilizers and other salines can influence corrosion rates. It suggests cleaning the machine after operations to protect it. However, I don't find any direct information comparing coastal vs. inland regions specifically regarding corrosion rates.\n\nSince there's no explicit data on how coastal versus inland regions affect corrosion for this specific model, I should conclude that such a comparison isn't provided in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information about the rate of corrosion on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD comparing coastal vs. inland agricultural regions.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities are for different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system. Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section on \"Apprendre \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la machine\" which translates to \"Learning about the machine,\" but it doesn't seem directly related to the communication protocols. Then there's \"Tracteur ISOBUS,\" which means \"ISOBUS Tractor,\" and \"Tracteur avec IsoMatch,\" meaning \"Tractor with IsoMatch.\" These are likely referring to specific models or systems, but I'm not sure if they relate to the communication protocol versions.\n\nNext, there's a mention of \"Alimentation par la batterie du tracteur,\" which is about battery feeding in the tractor. Not directly related. Then, \"Capteurs de vitesse et de r\u00e9gime de prise de force\" translates to \"Speed sensors and power intake regime.\" This seems more technical but still not about communication protocols.\n\nThe section \"Transformation du tracteur en tracteur ISOBUS avec faisceau IsoMatch Power\" talks about transforming a tractor into an ISOBUS tractor with IsoMatch Power. Again, this is about the system setup rather than specific protocol versions.\n\nLooking further down, there's a mention of \"Raccordement sur un tracteur ISOBUS,\" which means \"Connection on an ISOBUS tractor.\" This suggests that the tractor in question is already ISOBUS compatible. Then, it says that functions like distribution and data transfer pass through ISOBUS between the tractor terminal or control block and the machine.\n\nThe context also mentions that ISOBUS communication allows specifically handling the location and reacting to anomalies regarding the shape of the field and soil composition. Additionally, with GPS, various sensors, and a management system, necessary information is communicated to direct the machine optimally.\n\nThere's another section about \"Fonctionnalit\u00e9s ISOBUS via IsoMatch,\" which translates to \"ISOBUS functionalities via IsoMatch.\" It states that tractors without their own ISO terminal can function with the IsoMatch control block as an ISO tractor. This implies that IsoMatch acts as a substitute for the ISO terminal, allowing compatibility.\n\nThe last part before the context ends is incomplete but mentions signal of speed, power regime, and GPS on IsoMatch. \n\nNow, considering the question about detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with IsoMatch Tellus, I need to extract if there are multiple versions mentioned in the context.\n\nFrom the context, it seems that IsoMatch is a system used to make tractors compatible with ISOBUS. It allows tractors without their own ISO terminal to function as ISOBUS tractors by using IsoMatch as the control block. The communication involves functions like distribution and data transfer, location handling, and anomaly reactions.\n\nHowever, I don't see specific mentions of different protocol versions or their technical specs, such as bandwidths. The context focuses more on how IsoMatch enables compatibility rather than detailing each version's specifics.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, there isn't enough detail to specify the technical specifications or bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with IsoMatch Tellus.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context is a section from page 74 discussing operations before irrigation. It mentions that most types of fertilizers absorb water and can form blocks. These blocks can cause clogging at the irrigation point or emptying the irrigation layer. \n\nThere are several bullet points here. The first one says if conditions are humid, only use a well-sealed roller compacted soil cover. Another point advises never to irrigate without a roller compacted soil cover when conditions are humid. The third point warns against leaving fertilizer in the irrigation system for too long because blocks can form due to air humidity.\n\nThe fourth bullet is about cleaning the irrigation system after each use, including orifices and flow control devices. Then there's a text item explaining that after setting up the irrigation system, you can fill it up to the desired level. It suggests charging the machine when it's 10 cm above the ground. If manual operations aren't needed above the roller compacted soil, the height can be adjusted according to the automatic filling system.\n\nAnother text item mentions that if during filling (manual or with large bags), the distance between the edge of the roller compacted soil and the ground is over 1250 mm, a loading platform must be used. The height of filling is indicated at...\n\nWait, the context cuts off here. So I don't have the exact number for the maximum acceptable chunk size. However, looking back, there's mention of 1250 mm as a threshold for using a loading platform when the distance exceeds that. This suggests that beyond 1250 mm, issues like blockage can occur.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum acceptable size to prevent blockage. From the context, it seems that exceeding 1250 mm requires a platform, implying that up to 1250 mm might be manageable without one. However, since the exact number isn't provided, I should check if there's another mention.\n\nLooking again, the bullet points don't specify a maximum size directly. The key point is about using a loading platform when the distance is over 1250 mm. So perhaps the acceptable size is up to that point. But without an explicit number, it's unclear.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide a specific figure beyond mentioning 1250 mm as a threshold, I can infer that the maximum acceptable chunk size is likely around this value or less.

These blocks can cause clogging or water seeping away from the irrigation system.\n\nThen there are bullet points with advice:\n1. If conditions are humid, only use a well-sealed tarps.\n2. Never irrigate without a tarps when conditions are humid.\n3. Don't leave fertilizers in the irrigation system for long; blocks can form due to air humidity.\n4. Clean the irrigation system and orifices after each use.\n\nNone of these directly mention tolerance levels related to distance measurements from vanes, ground, or crop.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recommended tire pressure range for transport mode based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context is in French, but I can understand the key points. It mentions preparing the machine for transport and lists several steps that need to be followed before using the tractor and machine on public roads. One of these steps is checking if the tractor and machine meet road traffic rules, which includes tire pressure.\n\nLooking through the list items, I see a few relevant ones. The first one talks about verifying if the tractor and machine satisfy road traffic regulations. The second item mentions checking the functionality and fixation of lighting, warning signs, protections, and braking systems. The third item is about checking the operation of the quick coupling device on the lifting system.\n\nThen there's an item that says to install additional lighting and warning signs. Another one is about checking all removable parts and verifying their locking mechanisms, specifically mentioning \"jupe,\" \"ExactLine,\" and a hydraulic side mirror.\n\nThe next important point is regulating all parts of the machine and tractor, particularly the power takeoff, hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical systems, while they're in transport position. This likely includes checking tire pressure as part of the overall system regulation.\n\nAnother item mentions balancing the weight between the front and rear axles. Then, it says to fix optional weights if needed. Finally, it's about verifying the maximum height of the entire setup.\n\nNow, considering the question is about tire pressure range for transport mode, I need to see if any specific numbers or ranges are mentioned. From the context, I don't see exact figures like psi or bar values. Instead, it mentions checking the systems and their function, which would include tire pressure as part of routine checks.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of a specific range, but only that tire pressure is part of the overall system check, I might infer that the recommended range is standard for road use, perhaps based on manufacturer specifications or general transport regulations. However, without exact numbers, it's unclear.\n\nTherefore, the answer should state that the context doesn't provide specific tire pressure values but mentions that tire pressure checks are part of the preparation for transport.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify a recommended tire pressure range for transport mode but indicates that checking tire pressure is part of the preparation process.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context is in French, but I can understand the key points. It mentions that when spreading fertilizer on the edge of a field, it's important to get the right dosage. They talk about maximizing the dose after the border and minimizing losses from the other side of the field border.\n\nThere are two methods mentioned for border spreading: unilateral spreading using a hydraulic border deflector and ExactLine application. The text explains how each method works. For the first method, you drive along the edge and spread fertilizer into the field starting from the border. For the second, you go through the first row of pulverization starting from the field edge and spread towards it.\n\nIt also says that they recommend spreading on the field first before doing the borders. During border spreading, the system doesn't automatically do any targeting, so the application rate might not be precise. This can cause the actual rate to differ from what's desired.\n\nNow, the question is about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for the application rate. I'm looking for a specific percentage that ensures the right amount is applied.\n\nLooking through the context again, I don't see any direct mention of percentages or specific speeds. It talks about methods and directions but not numerical values related to speed reduction. So, there's no exact information provided on the optimal percentage.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, the answer should be \"Not found in context\" because the required information isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate. \n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

Situation A involves using the rows of pulverization (voies de pulv\u00e9rization). \n\nLooking at the details under situation A, there's a list of steps. The first step says to make a first pass with the center of the tractor about 2 meters from the edge of the field. That seems relevant because it specifies the distance from the field edge for the initial path.\n\nI don't see any other numbers mentioned regarding distances in this context that would pertain to the question specifically. The rest of the steps talk about adjusting speed, retracting deflectors, and so on, but nothing else about the distance from the edge during the first pass.\n\nSo, putting it together, the tolerance is 2 meters from the field edge when making the first path for border spreading in situation A.\n</think>\n\nThe distance tolerance from the field edge when driving the first path for border spreading is **2 meters**.",

But nothing specifically about the type of material for the gauge. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide any information about the material of the feeler gauge, I can't extract any specific details from it. Therefore, based on the given instructions, if the information isn't found in the context, the answer should be \"Not found in context\".\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, it's a list of elements from page 140. The first few items are about \"Maintenance\" and \"Replacement of the seal on the agitation tree.\" That seems relevant because the question is about the material specification for the seal. \n\nNext, there are some sections like \"Avoid contact with the slurry and other products,\" which talks about safety precautions when dealing with the equipment. Then it mentions specific steps to prevent accidents during control and adjustment of the agitator.\n\nNow, focusing on the list items under \"Attention not to get stuck!\" and the subsequent points, I see instructions like cutting the electronic control system, disconnecting the tractor contact, applying brakes, and waiting for all parts to be disengaged before maintenance. These are about safety during maintenance procedures but don't directly mention the material of the seal.\n\nI'm looking for any mention of materials related to the seal. The first TextItem mentions \"Replacement of the joint seal of the agitation tree.\" This suggests that the seal is part of the agitator's structure, specifically the axle. However, there's no specific material listed here\u2014just that it's being replaced.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide any details about the type or specification of the plastic used for the seal, I can't extract any information beyond knowing that maintenance involves replacing this seal. There are no technical specifications given, so I don't have enough data to answer the question accurately.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The first few are images and a text item saying \"Maintenance.\" Then there are a series of list items with instructions in French, like opening containers, removing an agitator from its tree, supporting a plastic roller bearing through a dosage hole, removing fixing bolts and metal seal rings, etc.\n\nI'm specifically looking for information about the material of the 'metal seal rings.' Scanning through the list items, I see one that says: \"Retirez les 3 boulons de fixation des bagues d'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00ea.\" Translating this from French, it means \"Remove the 3 fixing bolts from the metal seal rings.\" The term \"bagues d'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00ea\" translates to \"seal rings,\" and \"metal\" is explicitly mentioned here.\n\nSo, this line directly mentions that the seal rings in question are made of metal. There's no other information in the context that provides a different material for these specific seal rings. All references to them use the term \"metal,\" confirming their material.\n\nTherefore, the material of the 'metal seal rings' is indeed metal.\n</think>\n\nThe material of the 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal is **metal**.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several elements on page 144. The first few are about \"Accessoires\" and some cables like \"C\u00e2ble avec connecteurs 7 broches pour connexion ISO 11786 dans la cabine du tracteur.\" That seems to be a cable with 7-pin connectors for ISO 11786 in the tractor cabin.\n\nThen there's an entry about \"Entr\u00e9e capteur IsoMatch Tellus\" which is an input connector for IsoMatch Tellus. The next TextItem says it's an entrance for the IsoMatch Tellus with its connector, so that's probably a specific type of cable or adapter.\n\nThere's also a mention of \"C\u00e2ble RS232,\" but I'm not sure if that's directly related to ISO 11786. Then there's another TextItem on page 144 that says: \"Montez sur le connecteur 7 broches du c\u00e2ble de raccordement IsoMatch Tellus fourni en standard une rallonge de c\u00e2ble (option) vers la connexion tracteur ISO 11786 en cabine.\" Translating this, it means \"Mount the 7-pin connector of the IsoMatch Tellus cable provided in standard on a extension cable (optional) towards the tractor's ISO 11786 connection in the cabin.\"\n\nSo, from this, it seems that an optional extension cable is used with the IsoMatch Tellus. The key part here is \"rallonge de c\u00e2ble\" which means extension cable. However, the context doesn't specify the length of this extension cable. It just mentions that it's available as an option.\n\nSince the question asks for the specific length in meters, but there's no numerical value provided in the context, I can only infer that the exact length isn't specified here.

There's a mention of a website www.isomatchshop.com where you can buy a user license after the free evaluation period expires. \n\nLooking further, under the section \"Commande du GEOSPREAD par positionnement,\" it says that once the free evaluation period is over, you need to purchase a license from the IsoMatchShop website. There's no specific duration mentioned here, like 30 days or something.\n\nWait, in another part, there's a TextItem that says: \"La boutique en ligne www.isomatchshop.com vous permet d'acheter une licence d'utilisateur qui vous permettra, une fois la p\u00e9riode d'\u00e9valuation gratuite expir\u00e9e, d'utiliser votre machine avec...\" So this translates to the online store allows you to buy a user license which lets you use your machine after the free evaluation period ends.\n\nBut nowhere in the context does it specify how long the free test period is. It just mentions that there's an evaluation period before you need to buy the license. There are no numbers or durations given here, like 15 days or 30 days.\n\nSo based on this, I can't find any specific information about the duration of the free test period for GEOCONTROL software.
