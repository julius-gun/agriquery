There's also a note about checking the PTO shaft and connector for dirt or damage, pushing in the safety lock, sliding the connector, releasing the safety lock, checking if the safety plate latches by moving the connector, attaching check chains, and mounting them on fixed points.\n\nPage 54 also states that during lifting and lowering of the power lift, the coupling shaft requires adequate space for sliding in and out, and sufficient overlap between the profiled tubes when driving the machine in the extreme operating angle of the coupling shaft. It specifically mentions that the maximum operating angle is 30 degrees when lifted and 30 degrees when lowered. This seems to directly answer the question.\n\nI should make sure there's no other page with more precise information, but from what I can see, page 54 is the only one discussing the operating angles of the coupling shaft.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum permissible operating angle for the coupling shaft is **30 degrees** both when lifted and lowered.",

It also warns that if the decoupling ropes are too tight when the power lift is in its lowest position, the quick coupling might accidentally disconnect, leading to potential damage or injury.\n\nSo, focusing on this part, the key points are:\n1. Decoupling ropes must not be tense.\n2. They should allow enough movement even when the power lift is down.\n3. Accidental disconnection can cause harm, so proper tensioning is crucial.\n\nThe question specifically asks what must be ensured with decoupling ropes during power lift connection.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what happens when the hopper content in a spreader drops below 100 kg. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of the hopper content or its relation to the application process. Scanning through the context, I see that on page 101, there's a section discussing what happens if the hopper content is less than 100 kg. It says that the control system switches off the automatic calibration because the measurement accuracy would decline. This means that without enough fertiliser in the hopper, the spreader can't accurately measure and distribute the correct amount.\n\nAdditionally, it mentions that at low doses (less than 50 kg per hectare), the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration can be reduced by 15 kg. So, if someone is applying a lower dose, they might have even less fertiliser in the hopper before the system kicks in some adjustments.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other details related to this specific scenario. The context doesn't mention any other consequences beyond the automatic calibration being switched off and potential issues with measurement accuracy. There's no information about machine stopping or safety features triggered by low hopper content, just the impact on calibration and application rate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, when the hopper falls below 100 kg, the spreader's automatic calibration feature is disabled to prevent inaccurate distribution, which could lead to uneven fertiliser application. This is important for maintaining optimal crop yields and preventing waste or over-application of nutrients.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration due to reduced measurement accuracy. This adjustment helps maintain precise application rates, especially during low-dose applications where the minimum hopper capacity can be set as low as minus 15 kg.",

It also mentions hearing a loud noise or serious vibration, but those might be additional symptoms.\n\nThe context says that if you notice this issue, you should stop spreading immediately. That makes sense because continuing could spread uneven amounts of fertilizer, which isn't good. So, the first step is to stop the machine.\n\nNext, it tells me to disconnect the PTO shaft immediately. The PTO shaft connects the tractor's engine to the spreader, so stopping that would prevent further operation.\n\nThen, I should switch off the electronic control system.

The question is specifically about the distance between two specific parts: the rope and the discharge bushing opening.\n\nI'll go through each page to find any relevant information:\n\n- Page 133 talks about testing left and right spreading patterns but doesn't seem directly related.\n- Page 134 discusses maintenance, setting the dosing mechanism, and some checks.

Again, more about the internal mechanisms than the external parts.\n\n- Page 136 is about checking and setting the discharge point. It mentions that if the form of the spreading pattern isn't consistent between left and right, it could be due to a difference in the discharge point position relative to the spreading disc. However, this doesn't directly mention the rope or the bushing opening.\n\n- Page 137 specifically discusses adjusting the actuator plate so that the distance between the inside of the rope and the opening of the discharge bushing is exactly 109 mm.

The user provided a lot of data, but I'm specifically looking for information related to the hopper weight. \n\nI see that on page 36, there's a table with several columns. The first column seems to be the model number \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" and then it lists numbers which might correspond to different models or specifications.\n\nLooking at the rows under this table:\n- Row 10: Without hopper cover (kg) - 277,5\n- Row 11: With hopper cover (kg) - 324,5\n\nSince the question is about the hopper weight without the cover for the model 3225, I need to find which row corresponds to this model. \n\nLooking at the first column again, it seems each row represents a different model. The numbers after \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" are probably model numbers or variants. For example:\n- First entry: Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 1875\n- Second: 2550\n- Third: 3225\n- Fourth: 3900\n\nSo, the row for 3225 would be the third one in the table.\n\nChecking that, Row 10 is without cover at 277.5 kg and Row 11 with cover at 324.5 kg. Since we're looking for without the cover, it's 277.5 kg.\n\nI should make sure there are no other mentions of hopper weights elsewhere, but from this table, it seems that's the only relevant information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper weight without the hopper cover for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 is **277.5 kg**.",

        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, M18 refers to the size of the bolt, which is standard for machinery. The 10.9 quality probably refers to the strength class of the bolt. I think ISO standards classify bolts by their tensile strength, so 10.9 would mean a higher strength compared to lower classes like 4.6 or 8.8.\n\nNext, the friction coefficient of 0.13 is important because it affects how much torque is needed to prevent the bolt from loosening. A higher friction coefficient means more resistance, so more torque is required.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table on page 129 that lists torques for different bolts and nuts. The table seems to be under the section \"Steel tightening torques.\" I need to find the row for M18 and see what the values are for both 0.10 and 0.13 friction coefficients.\n\nFrom the table, I can see that for M18:\n- With a friction coefficient of 0.10, the torque is 195 Nm.\n- With a friction coefficient of 0.13, it's also 195 Nm.\n\nWait, that seems odd because usually, higher friction would require more torque. But in this table, both coefficients have the same value for M18. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check the context.\n\nLooking again at page 129, the table shows for M18:\n- Torque for 0.10 is 195 Nm.\n- Torque for 0.13 is also 195 Nm.\n\nHmm, that's consistent across both coefficients. Perhaps the way the table is structured doesn't differentiate between them, or maybe there was a formatting issue in the context provided. But based on what I have, both coefficients result in the same torque value of 195 Nm for M18.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient is 195 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient is **195 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:** 195 Nm",

        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque = Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Force \u00d7 D sin\u03b8. But since it's a bolted joint, the angle \u03b8 is typically 90 degrees, so sin\u03b8 is 1. That simplifies the formula to Torque = Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Force.\n\nNow, looking at the context provided, there are tables that list torques for different screw types and sizes. Specifically, on page 129, there's a table with M series bolts and their corresponding torque values based on friction coefficients. The question mentions a 0.2 friction coefficient, which is lower than the usual 0.3 or 0.10 mentioned elsewhere.\n\nI need to find the row in the table that matches an M6 bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Scanning through the table:\n\n- For M5: Torque values are given for 0.7, 1.7, etc., but not 0.2.\n- M6: Looking at the second row under 0.20 Torques, I see that for M6, the torque is listed as 9.9 Nm.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the table seems to have multiple columns. The first column is for 0.10 friction, and the second for 0.20. So for M6 with 0.20, it's 9.9 Nm.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier in the context, on page 129, the table starts with M5, then M6, etc., and each row has two torque values: one for 0.10 and another for 0.30 friction coefficients. So for M6, the first number is for 0.10 (8.4 Nm) and the second for 0.20 (13.2 Nm). Wait, no, looking again:\n\nThe table structure seems to be:\n- For each bolt size, two torque values are listed: one for 0.10 friction and another for 0.30.\n\nSo for M6, it's:\nM6: 8.4 (for 0.10) and 13.2 (for 0.30).\n\nBut the question specifies a 0.20 friction coefficient. Hmm, that's not directly listed in the table. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at page 129, the table starts with M5, then M6, etc., and each row has two numbers: one for 0.10 and another for 0.30. So for M6, it's 8.4 and 13.2 Nm. There's no entry for 0.20.\n\nWait, but the question mentions a friction coefficient of 0.20. Maybe I need to interpolate or see if there's an alternative approach. Alternatively, perhaps the table on page 130 is relevant since it also discusses M6 with 70 (A2) quality and 0.20 friction.\n\nLooking at page 130, the table for M6 with 0.20 Torques shows 9.9 Nm. Wait, no, that's not correct because earlier I thought it was 13.2 for 0.30. Maybe I'm mixing up the tables.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify:\n\nOn page 129, the table lists M6 with two torque values: 8.4 (for 0.10) and 13.2 (for 0.30). There's no entry for 0.20 in this table.\n\nThen on page 130, there's another table for M6 with 70 (A2), which lists torques for 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. So for 0.20, it's 9.9 Nm.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the question is about a 0.20 friction coefficient, so we need to use the second number from page 130, which is 9.9 Nm.\n\nBut wait, in the context provided, on page 129, the M6 row has two torque values: 8.4 and 13.2 for 0.10 and 0.30 respectively. Then on page 130, another table for M6 with 70 (A2) lists torques as 9.9, 13.2, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the correct value is 9.9 Nm for 0.20 friction coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question specifies a 0.2 friction coefficient,",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the context is a manual for a machine, likely a tractor with a spreading system. It mentions various sections like maintenance, safety, applications, and details about the PTO shaft, hydraulic systems, and engine operations.\n\nLooking at page 20, there are steps to switch off the machine safely, which includes disconnecting the PTO shaft and electronic controls, releasing hydraulic pressure, shutting off the tractor engine, removing the ignition key, and engaging the parking brake. This is standard safety procedure before servicing or maintenance.\n\nMoving on to page 21, it talks about maintenance intervals, authorized personnel for repairs, avoiding closed areas due to exhaust fumes, protecting the machine from corrosion, using original parts, and not working on a running machine. These are all about maintaining the tractor properly.\n\nPage 22 discusses safety regarding materials, explosion risks with nitrate fertilizers, preventing unintended operation by releasing pressure and disconnecting systems, and wearing protective gear. Again, these are safety measures but don't directly relate to diesel consumption.\n\nPages 23-25 cover applications of the machine, specifically the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD system. It mentions that this is a PTO shaft-driven machine for spreading fertilizers. The system uses software called GEOSPREAD with features like border spreading, gored spreading, and variable width distribution. There's mention of dosing plates, actuators controlling application rates, and fine application settings.\n\nOn page 24, it goes into detail about the spreader having two actuators per dosing unit to set application rate and working width independently. It also talks about fine dosing settings where two of three dosing openings are closed to prevent blockages, allowing precise flow even at low rates. The machine uses software to adjust settings based on factors like fertiliser type and flow rate.\n\nPage 25 discusses the spreading pattern, discharge point adjustment with additional actuators, and how the system calculates variable working width during passes, especially on headlands or incomplete final passes. It also mentions using GPS to determine over or under fertilization.\n\nNow, the question is about extra diesel consumption when using Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. The context doesn't explicitly mention fuel efficiency or diesel consumption for this specific system. It focuses on mechanical operations, safety, and application details but lacks any numerical data or calculations related to fuel usage.\n\nI don't see any information that directly addresses how much extra diesel is consumed by the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD.

Let me start by looking through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that one-sided boundary spreading is mentioned on page 29. It talks about being able to spread right up to the border using ExactLine. This seems useful because it allows spreading close to the edge without going over, which is good for minimizing environmental impact.\n\nThe context also mentions that this method can be used from the first sprayer tramline with ExactLine. That means even if you're working in a smaller area like a garden, you can still apply the fertilizer neatly along the border without waste.\n\nAdditionally, it's noted that ExactLine restricts loss over the edge to a minimum and provides full spreading patterns. This is important because small gardens might have uneven edges or slopes, and having precise control can help avoid over-application or spillage.\n\nHowever, I don't see any information that specifically mentions suitability for small gardens. The context focuses more on technical aspects like application rates and spreader functions rather than user-specific needs like garden size.\n\nSo, while one-sided boundary spreading is effective for minimizing edge loss and providing precise application, there's no direct indication from the provided text whether it's ideal or not for small gardens.

This suggests that the IsoMatch Tellus can navigate through menus using a scroll wheel.\n\nFurther down on page 35, under \"IsoMatch Grip,\" it talks about having 11 function buttons and a selector operated with the thumb. However, this is more about the Grip accessory rather than the main control box.\n\nOn page 34 again, there's a mention of additional functions including an Internet browser and a status bar for time, GPS signal strength, etc. But nothing directly about connecting to an external mouse.\n\nWait, but in the context, on page 33, under \"IsoMatch universal ISOBUS terminal,\" it says that many functions and programs are on one control box. It also mentions that the divided color screen has a flexible division, allowing operation of two programs or functions simultaneously without switching.

This relates to preventing blockages by ensuring the machine doesn't overload.\n\nI don't see any specific numbers directly stating the maximum chunk size in mm. However, the context emphasizes avoiding conditions that lead to chunk formation, such as moisture and long periods without use. It also mentions using covers and cleaning the spreader after use to prevent clogs.\n\nSince there's no explicit number provided, I can't extract a precise value from the context. Therefore, based on the instructions, if the information isn't found, I should respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Page 83 mentions reviewing and adapting settings based on the spreader's performance. Page 84 discusses testing the spreading pattern with a calibration test. \n\nOn page 85, there are several steps: placing troughs, adjusting PTO speed, driving along tracks, emptying troughs, lowering the border spreading plate, closing taps to prevent lifting, and disconnecting drives on non-spreading sides.\n\nWait, I think I see something. On page 85, one of the instructions is \"\\uf034 Close off the dosing on the side where no spreading is to be done.\" Then another instruction says: \"\\uf034 disconnect the drive of the plate on the side where no spreading is to be done.\"\n\nBut that's about disconnecting the drive, not the tap.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections about border spreading, including how to set up the field boundary and different methods of spreading. On page 107, it mentions that when using one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate, you can adjust the spreader's working width by changing the plate. It also talks about directions for spreading less or more to the edge, affecting both coverage and loss.\n\nSpecifically, on page 107, there are two directions mentioned: environmental setting (direction 1) and yield setting (direction 9). Direction 1 says to spread less to the field edge, which reduces loss but may not provide as good coverage. Direction 9 is the opposite, spreading more to improve coverage but increasing loss.\n\nThe key part here is about adjusting the PTO shaft RPM. On page 108, it states that the control system adjusts the dosing units so that the actual application rate matches the set rate by using a lower PTO shaft RPM. It also mentions that if the spreader fails or stops, you should stop spreading immediately.\n\nNow, regarding driving speed reduction percentage: on page 109, when working without sprayer tramlines (situation B), it says to drive the first path about 2 meters from the edge and decrease the PTO shaft RPM to 75%. This is likely to adjust the application rate. However, the exact instruction here is about reducing RPM, not necessarily the driving speed percentage.\n\nWait, but on page 107, under direction (1), it says \"Spread less to the field edge.\" To achieve this, you can reduce the PTO shaft RPM, which in turn affects how much fertilizer is applied. So, if you decrease the RPM, the application rate decreases, spreading less to the edge.\n\nBut the question asks for the optimal driving speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't directly mention a specific percentage but talks about adjusting the PTO shaft RPM. Since the PTO shaft controls the spreader's speed, reducing it would compensate for over-application or loss.\n\nHowever, without a specific percentage given in the context, I can only infer that the control system adjusts the RPM to maintain the set application rate. Therefore, the optimal reduction is whatever adjustment is needed to match the desired application rate, which might be determined by environmental settings or yield requirements.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal driving speed reduction percentage isn't explicitly stated but involves adjusting the PTO shaft RPM to compensate for application rate during border spreading.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the context given. It's a series of pages discussing different methods of spreading, specifically focusing on one-sided boundary spreading and using hydraulic border spreading plates or ExactLine accessories.\n\nOn page 107, it mentions that when doing one-sided boundary spreading, you drive along the field edge with the hydraulic border spreading plate. The working width can be adjusted by changing this plate. It also talks about directions for spreading less or more to the field edge, affecting loss and cover. Importantly, it states that the maximum acceptable loss is 10% of the quantity distributed in the center.\n\nMoving on to page 109, which discusses driving patterns. In situation A (sprayer tramlines), the first path is driven with the middle of the tractor about 2 meters from the field edge and the PTO shaft RPM reduced to 75%. Then, after the first pass, they either remove the border spreading plate or raise it, disconnecting the right spreading disc and closing the dosing unit. This suggests that during the first path, the distance is set at 2 meters.\n\nPage 110 talks about ExactLine, which also mentions driving half the working width (1/2 X meters) from the field edge as the first sprayer tramline. However, since the question specifically refers to border spreading, I should focus on that method rather than ExactLine.\n\nLooking back at page 107 and 109, both mention driving the first path about 2 meters from the field edge when using one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate. This seems consistent across different sections of the context.\n\nTherefore, the distance tolerance from the field edge during the first path for border spreading is 2 meters.\n</think>\n\nThe distance tolerance from the field edge when driving the first path for border spreading is **2 meters**.",

It mentions that the agitator axle must turn freely from the seal ring. There are some pictures and additional info about the agitator axle and seal ring, but nothing directly about screwdrivers.\n\nMoving to page 135, it talks about setting the dosing baffles. Again, I don't see any mention of screwdriver types here either. The instructions involve closing spreader dosing units, placing the machine on level ground, switching off systems, opening sieves, and checking for cracks between dosing plates.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. On page 134, there's a list of steps involving tools like \"\\uf034 Demount the connectors with the proper tools.\" But that's about connectors, not screwdrivers. Similarly, other steps mention using tools but don't specify types.\n\nHmm, perhaps the context doesn't explicitly state whether to use flathead or Phillips screwdrivers for adjusting the dosing mechanism. Without specific instructions on the type of screws used in the dosing mechanism, I can't determine which screwdriver is optimal.\n\nI should make sure I'm not assuming anything. The context doesn't provide details about the screw types used in the dosing mechanism's adjustments. Therefore, there's no information to base an answer on.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what type of feeler gauge material is recommended for checking the discharge bushing height. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 138, there's a section about checking and setting the discharge bushing height. It mentions that you can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately. The exact sentence is: \"You can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately.\" \n\nNow, I'm supposed to find out what type of material this feeler gauge is made from. The context doesn't explicitly state the material, but it does mention that it's used for measuring short distances. Feel gauges are typically made from materials like stainless steel or nickel because they're durable and precise. However, since the context only specifies that a feeler gauge is used without mentioning the material, I might not have enough information to determine the exact type.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about the type of feeler gauge material recommended. The context says \"feel gauge\" but doesn't specify the material. So perhaps the answer is that the material isn't specified in the given context. Alternatively, if it's implied by standard materials used for such tools, maybe it's stainless steel or nickel-plated.\n\nBut since the instructions say to base the answer strictly on the context and provide an exact match, and the context doesn't specify the material beyond mentioning the use of a feeler gauge, I should probably respond that the information isn't found in the context. Alternatively, if I have to make an educated guess based on standard practices, it's likely stainless steel or nickel, but without explicit mention, I can't be certain.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The context on page 138 says: \"You can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately.\" There's no mention of the material. So, strictly speaking, based on the given context, there's no information about the material of the feeler gauge. Therefore, I should respond that it's not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the type of material recommended for the feeler gauge used to check the discharge bushing height. \n\nAnswer: Not found in context.",
