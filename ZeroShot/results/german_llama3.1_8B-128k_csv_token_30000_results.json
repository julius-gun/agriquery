The trays are placed horizontally using a water gauge. The test is usually done for a field width of 24 meters, but can be adjusted to any other width.\n\nDuring the test, the spreader's settings should not be changed from those used during the previous pass. The only thing that may need to be adjusted is the speed of the spreader, which should be set to the same as the previous pass. If the dosage is less than 250 kg/ha, an additional run over the same path may be necessary to collect enough fertilizer for a proper comparison.\n\nThe test results are then compared with the desired range, and if they're not within it, adjustments can be made to the spreader's settings or the fertilizer application rate.",

These materials have good UV resistance and are often used for outdoor applications where they will be exposed to sunlight. They are also resistant to chemicals and abrasion.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific material with high UV resistance for use in a hopper cover, I would recommend considering the following options:\n\n* Polyester: A popular choice for sail materials due to its good UV resistance and durability.\n* Nylon: Another common option that offers excellent UV protection and is often used for outdoor applications.\n* Polypropylene: A strong and durable material with good UV resistance.\n\nPlease note that these are general information, and the specific requirements of your application may require a different type of sail material.
