The \\u00e9ments like \"engagement\" (product type) and other relevant elements are crucial for determining the exact working width.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements**: Extract key elements from the manual content that specify the desired working width.\n2. **Analyze Dimensions**: Determine which dimensions or attributes correspond to the desired working width.\n3. **Determine Output**: Based on these, calculate the exact \\u00e9t.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Working Width}}",
