It mentions \"Feindosierung,\" which translates to fine application or precise dosing. The key part here is about the number of dosing openings that are closed when applying a fine dose.\n\nLooking at the text, under \"Feindosieren\" (fine application), it says: \"Im Feindosierstand sind 2 der 3 Dosier\u00f6ffnungen geschlossen.\" Translating this, \"In the fine dosing position, 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed.\"\n\nSo, during fine application, two out of three dosing openings are closed. This setup ensures a precise and reliable flow even when dealing with small doses, which helps prevent blockages.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the context that would change this number. The focus is on having two closed while one remains open to maintain the necessary flow without clogging.\n</think>\n\nDuring fine application, 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed.",

The ISOBUS communication protocol is used here, which is suitable for spreaders with the same system. For those without ISOBUS, a universal IsoMatch terminal can be provided by the dealer. This setup allows continuous monitoring of the fertilizer quantity.\n\nThe text also mentions that the spreader measures the amount of fertilizer being spread using weighing cells. The computer in the distributor compares this measured amount to the set dosage and adjusts accordingly if needed. It also refers to the required speed and location, which are handled by the electronics of the spreader or a GPS sensor.\n\nAdditionally, it talks about controlling working widths and start/stop times at field edges or headlands using parcel data from management systems or new parcel boundaries.\n\nPutting this together, the system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity is the automatic weighing system integrated with the ISOBUS communication protocol.

If you don't adjust its length before attaching it, it can cause significant issues. It also refers to two sections: one about controlling the length of the joint on page 50 and another about shortening the coupling shaft on page 51.\n\nMoving further down, there are specific steps for checking and adjusting the coupling shaft, like inspecting the drive sprocket and coupling piece for dirt or damage, pressing a safety ring into the coupling piece, sliding the coupling piece onto the drive sprocket, releasing the safety ring, checking if the arretier device engages by moving the coupling piece, and installing protective chains.\n\nImportantly, it mentions that when lifting or lowering the hub, enough space is needed for the Gelenkwelle. The Gelenkwelle must allow easy insertion and withdrawal without causing issues during operation. It also states that the maximum angle is 30 degrees above and below the horizontal position. This ensures that the coupling shaft doesn't cause damage beyond this point.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the maximum permissible operating angle for the coupling shaft when lifted or lowered is 30 degrees on either side of the horizontal.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum permissible operating angle for the coupling shaft is **30 degrees above and below the horizontal position**.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the hopper weight without the hopper cover for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225. Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see there's a table with various technical data. The model number is Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD, and one of the entries is \"Beh\u00e4ltergewicht\" which translates to hopper weight. There are different rows for \"without Abdeckplane\" (without cover) and \"with Abdeckplane\" (with cover).\n\nLooking at row 10: Beh\u00e4ltergewicht Ohne Abdeckplane (kg), I see the numbers listed as 277,5; 307,5; 337,5; 367,5. Since we're looking for the 3225 model, I need to find which number corresponds to that.\n\nThe models are probably in order: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. So row 10's first entry is for 1875, second for 2550, third for 3225, and fourth for 3900. The numbers increase as the model number increases. \n\nSo for 3225, the hopper weight without cover would be 337,5 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper weight without the hopper cover for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 is **337.5 kg**.\n\n**Answer:** 337.5",

The first row says \"Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD\" and then numbers: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. It looks like these are different models or versions of the machine.\n\nThe question is specifically about the weight in kg of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900. So I need to find which row corresponds to this model and then look at its weight.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD with values 1875, 2550, etc.\n- Row 6: Maximale Zuladung (kg) is 3900 for all models.\n- Row 8: Maximales Gesamtgewicht (kg) is 4895 for all.\n\nWait, but the question is about the weight of the machine itself, not its load capacity. So I need to find the exact weight listed for the GEOSPREAD 3900 model.\n\nLooking again, row 1 lists the models with their weights: 1875, 2550, etc., up to 3900.

Page 24 has some technical data, but it's mostly about things like d\u00fcngerdosis and Zapfwellendrehzahl, which don't seem relevant to sound levels. \n\nThen, looking at page 37, the table starts with line numbers 0 to 6. Line 2 mentions \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" with values 71.9 and 76.2. Since the question is about a Tractor plus spreading spreader, I think this refers to the tractor's sound level.\n\nLine 3 talks about the tractor plus an empty spreader, which gives 71.9 dB.

It talks about collecting these waste materials and disposing them according to national regulations. That doesn't seem directly related to vanes inspection, so I'll set that aside.\n\nNext, on page 125, it discusses maintenance intervals. There's a table listing various maintenance tasks with their intervals. The first entry is \"Kontrolle von Schrauben und Muttern\" (Control of screws and nuts) with an interval of 130.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a table listing Anzugsmomente (which I think means torque) for different screw types like bolts and nuts. The columns are labeled with numbers and letters, probably indicating specific screw sizes or qualities. For example, M5, M6, up to M24. Each row corresponds to a different torque value in Nm.\n\nLooking at the table headers, it seems that the first column is the quality (like M5, M6, etc.), followed by numbers which I assume are the torque values for each quality. The rows go from 0 to 10, and then 13, so maybe those are standard torques.\n\nI need to find the row for M18 and the 10.9 quality. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- M5: ... up to 10 Nm\n- M6: ... up to 15 Nm\n- M8: ... up to 36 Nm\n- M10: ... up to 70 Nm\n- M12: ... up to 145 Nm\n- M14: ... up to 230 Nm\n- M16: ... up to 350 Nm\n- M18: ... up to 490 Nm\n\nWait, but the table seems a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table more carefully:\n\nThe first column is Quality, then .Gewinde (which I think is thread size), followed by Anzugsmomente with two numbers separated by a comma, probably indicating two torque values for different situations, like 0.10 and 0.13 friction coefficients.\n\nSo, for M18, the row is:\n\nM18: 490, 410\n\nWait, no, looking at the table:\n\nFor M18, it's listed as:\n- M18: 490, 410\n\nBut I think that might be a typo or formatting issue because earlier rows have two numbers separated by a comma. For example, M5 has 1,7 and 2, which probably means 10 Nm for 0.10 and 13 Nm for 0.13.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table again:\n\nThe headers are:\nQuality | .Gewinde | Anzugsmomente\nThen each row is like:\n0 | M5 | 1,7 | 2\n\nI think that's a formatting issue because in the context, it's written as:\n\n<text>0                          M5                     1,7                       2                       5                       6                        7                        8                        9                       10</text>\n\nSo perhaps each row is Quality, .Gewinde (which might be the thread size), then two torque values for 0.10 and 0.13.\n\nWait, but in the question, it's asking for a friction coefficient of 0.13, so I need to find the second number in the Anzugsmomente column for M18.\n\nLooking at the M18 row:\n\nM18: ... 490, 410\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because earlier rows have two numbers separated by a comma, like 1,7 or 2. So maybe it's a typo and should be 10,13 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nThe table seems to have columns for Quality (M5, M6, etc.), .Gewinde (which might be thread size), and then two torque values: one for 0.10 friction and another for 0.13.\n\nSo each row is:\n\nQuality | .Gewinde | Anzugsmomente_0.10 | Anzugsmomente_0.13\n\nFor example, M5 has 1,7 and 2, which might mean 10 Nm (1,7) and 20 Nm (2). But that doesn't align with the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are in pairs, like for each Quality, there's a .Gewinde and then two torque values. So M5 has 1,7 and 2, which might be 10 Nm and 13 Nm? Or maybe it's 0.10 and 0.13 coefficients.\n\nWait, the context says:\n\n<text>* Der Reibungskoeffizient von 0,10 gilt f\u00fcr ge\u00f6ltes Blech, Gusseisen, geh\u00e4rtete Fl\u00e4chen, gefettete Gewinde usw.

        "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and with a 0.2 friction be fastened?",
        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque = Friction * Diameter\u00b2 / 2. But wait, actually, it's more precise to use Torque = Friction * Diameter\u00b2. Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me double-check that formula. Oh right, for a bolt with friction f and diameter d, the torque T is given by T = f * \u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 4. So it's (friction coefficient) multiplied by pi times the square of the diameter, divided by four.\n\nNow, looking at the context provided, there's a table that lists Anzugsmomente (which I think translates to torque in Nm) for different materials and sizes. The columns are labeled with numbers like 4.6.0,10; 8.8.0,13; etc., which might correspond to some kind of classification. The rows are for different M sizes: M5, M6, up to M24.\n\nI'm looking for an M6 bolt. Scanning the table, I see that under M6, there are two values: 3 and 15. Wait, no, let me check again. The table seems a bit confusingly formatted. It starts with columns like Qualit\u00e4t (Quality), Reibung (Friction), .Gewinde (Gewinde?), Anzugsmomente, and then numbers. Maybe the first column is Quality, the second is Friction coefficient, followed by something else.\n\nLooking at the rows for M6: The first row under M6 has 3 and 15 as torque values. But I'm not sure what those numbers correspond to. Is it based on different friction coefficients? The context mentions that the higher value (0.13) is for dry steel, while 0.10 is for oiled steel.\n\nWait, the question specifies a friction coefficient of 0.2. Hmm, but in the table, I don't see a 0.2 value. The highest I see is 0.18 under M24. So maybe the context doesn't provide data for 0.2. That could be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers after the decimal points are not the friction coefficients but something else. Maybe it's a combination of quality and friction? For example, 4.6.0,10 might mean Quality 4, Friction 6, something 0, torque 10 Nm. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, looking back at the context, there's a note that says \"* Der Reibungskoeffizient von 0,10 gilt f\u00fcr ge\u00f6ltes Blech...\" which translates to \"The friction coefficient of 0.10 applies for oiled steel.\" So maybe the lower numbers in the table correspond to 0.10, and higher ones to 0.13.\n\nBut the question is asking for a friction coefficient of 0.2, which isn't mentioned in the context. That's confusing because the table doesn't go up to 0.2. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers after the decimal points are not the friction coefficients but something else, like tensile strength or something. But that seems less likely.\n\nWait, maybe the first number is the quality (like A2), and the second is the friction coefficient. For example, under M6, the first row has 3 and 15. If 3 corresponds to a lower friction, say 0.10, then torque would be calculated as 0.10 * \u03c0 * d\u00b2 /4.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what each column represents, it's hard to tell. The context mentions that for M6, the torques are 3 and 15 Nm. Maybe these correspond to different friction coefficients: one at 0.10 and another at 0.13.\n\nGiven that, if the question is asking for a torque with a friction coefficient of 0.2, which isn't in the table, perhaps it's not provided. So I might have to respond that it's not found in the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The table lists specific torques for each M size and quality. For M6 with A2 quality, the torque is 15 Nm at a higher friction coefficient (probably 0.13). But since the question specifies 0.2, which isn't in the table, I can't extract that information.\n\nSo, based on the context provided, there's no data for a friction coefficient of 0.2.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what to do if the fertilizer flow is blocked and which page to look at. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context is in German, but I can understand some terms. It mentions \"Beseitigung von St\u00f6rungen\" which translates to \"Elimination of disturbances.\" There's a table with problems, possible causes, and solutions. Each row has a problem number, the issue, possible cause, and solution.\n\nLooking for keywords related to fertilizer flow being blocked. The term \"Unrichtige Do- sis (kg pro Hektar)\" appears multiple times, which translates to incorrect dosage per hectare. This seems like it's causing issues in the table entries.\n\nNow, I need to find the specific problem where the fertilizer flow is blocked. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Problem 0: Unrichtige Do- sis (kg pro Hektar)\n2. Problem 1: Same issue\n3. Problem 2: Signal Fahrgeschwindigkeit nicht richtig ein- gestellt (incorrect speed signal)\n4. Problem 3: Signal Fahrgeschwindigkeit unrichtig (wrong speed signal)\n5. Problem 4: Falscher Abstand zwischen den Fahrspuren (wrong spacing between tracks)\n6. Problem 5: Neue Partie Kunstd\u00fcnger mit denselben Einstellungen verteilt wie vorherige Partie. Die Qualit\u00e4t wechselt stark pro Partie (new batch of fertilizer with same settings, quality changes per batch)\n7. Problem 6: Durchstrom von Kunstd\u00fcnger wird behin- dert (fertilizer flow is hindered)\n8. Problem 7: Kein Dosierstand und Auslassgeschwindigkeit in 'Curve Calibration' eingegeben (no dosage and outflow speed entered in Curve Calibration)\n9. Problem 8: Falsche Dosis, falsche Arbeitsbreite bzw. falschen Buchstabenwert Auslauf\u00f6ffnung eingegeben (incorrect dosage, width, or value for exit opening)\n10. Problem 9: Bediensystem auf manuelle Be- dienung gestellt (system set to manual operation)\n11. Problem 10: Manueller Abdrehtest bei einer manuell eingegebenen Dosis verkehrte Werte eingegeben (manual test with incorrect values entered after manual dosage)\n12. Problem 11: Fahrgeschwindigkeitsmessung klappt nicht oder wird nicht gem (speed measurement doesn't work or isn't recorded)\n\nProblem 6 specifically mentions \"Durchstrom von Kunstd\u00fcnger wird behin- dert,\" which translates to \"fertilizer flow is hindered.\" So, this is the relevant issue.\n\nThe solution for Problem 6 is: \"Nach jedem Gebrauch die Maschine gr\u00fcnd- lich reinigen. R\u00fchrer ersetzen, wenn dieser verschlissen ist\" (Clean the machine thoroughly after each use. Replace the stirrer if it's worn out).\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has a \"Seite\" column which means page number. Problem 6 is on page 118.\n\nSo, the answer should be: If the fertilizer flow is blocked, check page 118 for the solution.\n</think>\n\nIf the fertilizer flow is blocked, refer to page 118 for the solution.",

The key parts here are about how it's attached to the tractor and the software used.\n\nLooking at the specific information related to the question: The context talks about attaching the GEOSPREAD system either via a three-point hitch on category II tractors, using a Zwischenbock for category III tractors with Kraftheber, or a delivered wheel kit. It also mentions that Grenzstreuen (edge spreading) is possible using Hydraulischer Grenzstreublech or the ExactLine Grenzstreusystem.\n\nThe question is about diesel consumption specifically for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. I'm looking for any mention of fuel efficiency or extra diesel usage related to this system. However, in the provided context, there's no direct information about diesel consumption rates or how much extra diesel is used compared to other methods or tractors.\n\nThe context describes the mechanical components like the two steel plates with eight scoops and how they distribute the fertilizer.

There's a mention of using external sensors like a nitrogen sensor to control the dosage.\n\nOn page 23, it says the stirrer prevents blockage by controlling dosing openings. So, if you close two out of three, it reduces the risk of clogging but still allows precise dosing.\n\nNow, regarding cost: The context doesn't explicitly state anything about costs or expenses related to fine vs. normal dosing.

Let me start by understanding what one-sided boundary spreading means in this context. From the context provided, it seems like boundary spreading is a method used in agriculture, possibly related to how chemicals or fertilizers are applied to fields.\n\nLooking at the context, there's mention of \"Grenzabstreuen mit Grenzstreublech,\" which translates to boundary spreading with a border spreader. This technique allows filling half of the field uniformly along the edge. It also mentions optimizing the field size and reducing environmental impact by adjusting the border spreader.\n\nThe context talks about how this method can be used on different garden sizes, as it's mentioned in relation to \"Fl\u00e4chend\u00fcngung,\" which I think refers to area fertilization. It says that with the right settings, you can achieve optimal distribution with minimal environmental impact.\n\nSince the question is specifically about small gardens, I need to see if this method is applicable there. The context doesn't explicitly mention small gardens but does discuss adjusting for different field sizes and optimizing based on size. So, it's reasonable to infer that one-sided boundary spreading can be adapted for smaller areas by appropriately setting the border spreader.\n\nTherefore, yes, one-sided boundary spreading seems suitable for small gardens as it allows for precise application and reduced environmental impact, which is beneficial for smaller spaces.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens.

It says to hold the switch for at least one second before switching off. There's a warning that leaving the unit on can activate unintended functions while in a danger zone and consumes power, draining the battery.\n\nFurther down, it mentions that after starting, the last two applications used are displayed on the screen. Then it describes the ISOMatch Go as a compact version with complete ISO control but fewer USB ports and no WLAN/WIFI compared to other models. It also talks about developments in ISO-BUS communication and simplicity in the Tellus GO.\n\nOn page 33, there's something about connecting the Schlepper via an IM Tellus 9-polige 'In Cab' cable if it has a full ISOBUS connection. The standard cables are mentioned as well.\n\nNow, looking for anything related to external devices like a mouse.

The key part here is \"Schalten Sie die Zapfwelle ein und stellen Sie die Drehzahl der Streuscheiben ein...\" which translates to \"Engage the PTO and set the speed of the spreader discs.\" This means once you've started, you can adjust the speed by changing gears.\n\nBut how do you stop it? The context mentions not to let the spreader run unnecessarily without the dosing units closed. It also says to press the start button to open them. So stopping would involve closing the dosing units and possibly disengaging the PTO or changing gears to a lower speed until stopped.\n\nI think the main action is to stop the spreader by shutting off the flow, which might be done by closing the dosing units and maybe disengaging the PTO.\n</think>\n\nTo stop spreading fertilizer, close the dosing units and adjust the machine's speed to a lower gear or disengage the PTO until the process is halted.",

There are two situations mentioned: Situation A and Situation B, involving ExactLine and additional components like Umlauf.\n\nThe question is asking about the maximum height the fertilizer flies without using GEOCONTROL. I'm looking for information related to how high the fertilizer is thrown when not using this specific headland technology.\n\nLooking through the context, on page 103, it mentions that without GEOCONTROL, you stop the spreading by closing the dosage units when a certain distance from the field edge is reached. It also says to let the discs rotate but not shut off the hydraulic system. Then, after rotating, the dosage units are opened again at a specific distance.\n\nHowever, I don't see any direct mention of the maximum height in this context. The focus seems to be on the process of stopping and starting the spreading without GEOCONTROL rather than the height or trajectory of the fertilizer particles.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the flight height when not using GEOCONTROL, I should respond that it's unknown based on the provided text.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what \"seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate\" is. Let me start by breaking down the question. It mentions a seven-sided boundary, which probably refers to something that has seven edges or sides. The term \"spreading\" in this context likely means distributing or applying something evenly.\n\nThe second part of the question is about the hydraulic border spreading plate. From the context provided, I remember there are two types of boundary spreading methods: Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen and Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen. The first one uses a hydraulic plate called the hydraulisches Grenzstreublech.\n\nLooking at page 107, it explains that with this hydraulic plate, you can adjust the width where the fertilizers are spread along the field edge. It mentions two directions: Richtung X (1) and Richtung (9). In Richtung X, less is applied near the edge, resulting in lower loss but a worse fill. In Richtung 9, more is applied, leading to better fill but higher loss.\n\nThe key point here is that this method allows for precise control of where the fertilizers are spread along the boundary, ensuring minimal loss over the field edge while maintaining an adequate distribution. The seven-sided part might refer to the adjustable plate having multiple positions or sides to choose from, allowing for different spreading patterns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border plate is a method that allows farmers to spread fertilizers precisely along the field's edges in two different ways, optimizing both yield and loss according to specific norms.\n</think>\n\nSeven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate is a method allowing precise control of fertilizer application along the field edge.

In Richtung X (1), less fertilizer is applied near the edge, reducing loss but potentially leading to uneven distribution. In Richtung 9, more fertilizer is applied closer to the edge, improving coverage but increasing the risk of loss. This method ensures compliance with environmental regulations by limiting the amount of fertilizer lost over the field edge.\n\nSeven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate is a technique used in agriculture that allows farmers to spread fertilizers along the edges of their fields in two different ways.

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, on page 112, there's a section about ending the work. It mentions several steps that should be taken before moving on. The first thing is to close the dosing units. That makes sense because you don't want any parts open while transporting.\n\nNext, it says to shut off the gearbox. Wait, no, actually, it says to turn off the centrifuge. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check again. Oh, no, it's about shutting off the centrifuge, which is part of the machine, so that's important for transport.\n\nThen, the electronic control system should be turned off. That\u2019s crucial because you don't want any electrical components running while moving the machine around.\n\nAfter that, the slurry pump needs to be stopped and disconnected from the hydraulic line. This prevents any leaks or movement during transport.\n\nNext step is to disengage the clutch by removing the key from the clutch pedal. This ensures the machine isn\u2019t accidentally started while being transported.\n\nApplying the parking brake is also necessary to secure the machine in place, preventing it from rolling away.\n\nFinally, they mention clearing out any leftover material, earth, or stones from the machine. This is probably to avoid spillage or damage during transport.\n\nSo, putting all these together, the measures are: closing dosing units, stopping the centrifuge, turning off the control system, shutting down the slurry pump and hydraulic line, disengaging the clutch, applying the parking brake, and clearing debris.\n</think>\n\nWhen stopping work for road transport, follow these measures:\n\n1.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context is in German, but I can understand the main points. It talks about maintaining machinery, specifically mentioning grease nipples and the importance of lubrication. \n\nFrom the text on page 118, it says that before putting the machine out of operation for a period, whether short or long, the machine should first be greased, then cleaned, and then greased again. The reason given is to prevent dirt, chemicals, and water from getting into the bearings during cleaning. This step helps in maintaining the machine's longevity and reducing downtime caused by operational issues.\n\nSo, if the grease nipples aren't lubricated, it means that when the machine is being cleaned or stored, these critical points might not be protected. Without proper lubrication, dirt and other contaminants could enter the machinery, leading to wear and tear, corrosion, and potential breakdowns. This would definitely affect the machine's performance and lifespan negatively.\n\nI think the key point here is that failing to lubricate the grease nipples can allow contaminants into the bearings, which are essential for the machine's function. This leads to a shorter lifespan because the components aren't protected against wear and corrosion.\n</think>\n\nIf the machine grease nipples are never lubricated, dirt and other contaminants may enter the machinery during cleaning or storage, leading to accelerated wear, corrosion, and potential breakdowns, thereby reducing the machine's lifespan.",

It mentions various points related to safety and proper usage, including avoiding accidents, following guarantee conditions, ensuring the machine is operational, and so on.\n\nLooking at the question again: it's asking specifically about the international standard that specifies the pictograms used in this manual. Pictograms are those little symbols or icons that represent specific actions, warnings, or instructions.\n\nFrom the context, I see a section labeled \"HINWEIS\" which means \"Hint\" or \"Note.\" Within this, there's an explanation of various symbols used in the text to make it more understandable. The symbols include points for lists, winks (maybe indicating required actions), arrows pointing to other locations, and piktograms to help find certain parts of the text.\n\nFurther down, under \"HINWEIS,\" it mentions that behind the words 'Tipp' and 'Hinweis,' tips and notes for operation are given. It also talks about a Warndreieck (warning triangle), which points out important safety precautions. Missing these can lead to severe machine issues, damage, or accidents.\n\nAdditionally, there's mention of a Gabelschl\u00fcssel (maybe a key with a handle) used to mark tips for assembly or adjustment work.

Therefore, protective gloves are advised. It specifically lists safety gloves as an example: \"Sicherheitshandschuhe,\" which means safety gloves.\n\nAdditionally, there's a mention of other protective gear like safety shoes and goggles, but the question is specifically about gloves. The context also warns against using non-original parts because they can cause issues with the machine's function and safety.\n\nPutting this together, the exact information needed is that safety gloves (Sicherheitshandschuhe) are required for cleaning fertilizer remnants before welding.\n</think>\n\nSafety gloves (Sicherheitshandschuhe) are necessary for cleaning fertilizer residues from the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD before welding.",

Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the context mentions \"ISOBUS-Schlepperanschluss\" which translates to ISOBUS connection for the sleeder. It talks about how ISOBUS enables communication between the sleeder terminal or ISO-Bedienpult and the machine. It also mentions that this communication allows for operations like GPS data, sensor readings, and control functions.\n\nLooking further, there's a part about the GPS signal being used via RS 232 on the Bedienpult for GEOCONTROL functions. It also discusses how the speed signal is transferred from the sleeder to IsoMatch using specific cables. The context mentions that if a sleeder doesn't have ISOBUS communication, it can be retrofitted with an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to become fully ISOBUS-r\u00fcstet.\n\nHowever, I don't see any specific technical details about the bandwidth or protocol versions. The context refers to different ISOBUS versions but doesn't provide specifics like data rates or supported protocols beyond mentioning that GPS and other sensors are integrated through ISOBUS communication.\n\nSince there's no explicit information on the exact bandwidth capabilities or detailed specifications of the ISOBUS versions compatible with IsoMatch Tellus, I can't extract specific numbers or details from the given context.

It mentions things like a computer, internet browser, camera display (camera is optional), status bar for time, GPS signal strength, and driving direction. It also talks about storing and reading documents, operator data, field data, work data from various ISO machines, and customer data. There's a main switch on the left side of the red border that turns the control panel on or off. It says to hold the switch for at least one second to turn it on or off. It also warns that if you leave the unit on while in a danger zone, some functions might activate unintentionally, and it consumes power, draining the battery.\n\nMoving further down page 34, it mentions that after starting up, the last two applications used are displayed on the screen. Then it describes the Isomatch Go as a compact version with full ISO control but fewer USB ports and no WLAN/WIFI. It also talks about developments in ISOBUS communication and easier operation in the Tellus GO.\n\nPage 33 seems to talk about controls from the cab using a camera, specifically pointing at machine parts, harvest material, or surroundings. There's mention of an \"In Cab\" 9-polige Kabel for connecting the Isomatch Tellus GO to the tractor. It also mentions standard cables and a scroll wheel navigation.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about battery life when left switched on with the engine off. The context doesn't explicitly state how long the IsoMatch Tellus can operate before draining the battery. However, it does mention that leaving the Bedieneinheit (operator unit) on consumes power, which can drain the tractor's battery.\n\nI don't see any specific numbers or details about battery consumption rates or estimated operation times. The context provides information about functions and connections but doesn't give direct information on battery life duration.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there's no specific data provided to answer how many hours it can operate before flattening the battery.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what specific grease type is recommended for the profiled tubes of the coupling shaft based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 51, there are several steps mentioned related to adjusting and maintaining the coupling shaft. The first thing that stands out is \"Die Profilrohre sollen einander so weit wie m\u00f6glich \u00fcberlappen; es ist eine \u00dcberlappung von mindestens 150 mm erforderlich.\" This translates to ensuring the profiled tubes overlap as much as possible, requiring at least 150mm of overlap.\n\nNext, it mentions that the profiled tubes must have at least 25mm of play if the driveshaft and the machine's drive shaft are aligned. So, \"Die Profilrohre m\u00fcssen an den Enden jedoch \u00fcber mindestens 25 mm Spiel verf\u00fcgen...\" This tells me about the clearance needed.\n\nThen, there's a step to shorten both profiled tubes so that there's still 25mm of play left. \"Die Profile Rohren sollen so viel wie m\u00f6glich k\u00fcrzen, damit noch ein Spiel von 25 mm bleibt.\" This is crucial because it shows that the grease type must accommodate this play.\n\nAnother point is about cleaning the coupling shaft: \"Die Gelenkwelle reinigen.\" Cleaning might affect the grease, but the context doesn't specify what to use, so I'll focus on the grease itself.\n\nThere's also a mention of fitting and attaching the coupling shaft to both the machine and the winch: \"Die Gelenkwelle an die Maschine und den Schlepper ankuppeln.\" This is about installation but not directly about the grease.\n\nThe context then talks about operating the machine safely, including disengaging the winch motor and removing the ignition key. This is safety protocol but doesn't relate to grease type.\n\nIt mentions setting the machine on a support stand so the winch stays elevated: \"Setzen Sie die Maschine auf einen St\u00fctzbock, wobei der Kraftheber im h\u00f6chsten Stand bleibt.\" Again, this is about operation and safety, not grease.\n\nThere's a step to check if the largest working angle of the coupling shaft is less than 30 degrees: \"Kontrollieren Sie nun, ob der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Arbeitswinkel geringer als 30 \u00b0 ist.\" This relates to maintenance but not directly to grease.\n\nChecking the overlap again: \"Pr\u00fcfen Sie, ob die \u00dcberlappung der Profilrohre jetzt noch mindestens 150 mm betr\u00e4gt.\" Ensuring the correct overlap is maintained.\n\nThen, it says to remove the left profiled tube of the winch: \"Das schlepperseitige Profilrohr l\u00f6sen.\" This is about disassembly but not grease.\n\nApplying grease: \"Die Profilrohre einfetten.\" So, they are lubricated. The type isn't specified here, though.\n\nNext steps involve attaching the coupling shaft to the winch and applying safety chains: \"Die Gelenkwelle am Schlepper befestigen.\" This is about installation but not grease.\n\nFinally, it mentions installing safety chains on the protective tubes to prevent them from moving: \"Immer die Sicherungsketten der Schutzrohre anbringen.\" Again, this is about protection and doesn't specify the grease type.\n\nNow, looking for any mention of grease types. Scanning through, I see steps like cleaning the coupling shaft but nothing specific about the grease used. The only reference to lubrication is \"Die Profilrohre einfetten,\" which means greasing the profiled tubes. However, the context doesn't specify what type of grease is recommended.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of a particular grease type in the provided context, I can't extract any specific information about it. Therefore, based on the instructions, if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the recommended grease type for the profiled tubes of the coupling shaft.\n\n**Answer:** Unknown",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context provided is in German, but I can understand some technical terms. It mentions things like \"Gelenkwelle,\" which I think refers to a joint or coupling. There's also talk about the largest working angle of the joint being 30 degrees above and below, and that this position allows for maximum length between the pump and the machine's drive shaft without causing damage.\n\nLooking further, there are instructions on connecting hydraulic hoses and couplings, like ensuring they're clean and properly attached. It also talks about electrical connectors and how to connect them correctly, mentioning things like CAN-Steckers (CAN connectors) and ISOBUS communication connectors.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the \"hose coupling support.\" From the context, I see that it's related to ensuring the joint or coupling of hoses can be moved in and out without issues. The key part here is that when the joint is at its maximum working angle (30 degrees above and below), there's enough overlap between the pipe profiles to prevent damage.\n\nSo, putting this together, the support for the hose coupling must be designed to handle these angles and ensure proper alignment and movement of the hoses without causing wear or tear. The context doesn't specify the exact material but focuses on the functional aspect related to angle and overlap.\n</think>\n\nThe \"hose coupling support\" is designed to allow the joint to move freely within a range of 30 degrees above and below its central position, ensuring proper alignment and preventing damage to the hoses.\n\n**Answer:** The hose coupling support allows the joint to move between 30\u00b0 above and below its central position.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer in millimeters to prevent blockages. Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the text, there's a section about \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen,\" which translates to working before spreading fertilizer. It mentions that most types of artificial fertilizers absorb water and can form large blocks. These blocks can cause blockages or mess up the spreader.\n\nThen, under some tips, it says:\n- Work with a well-sealed cover when the weather is damp.\n- Don't spread without a cover when it's wet.\n- Don't let fertilizer stay in the spreader for too long because moisture in the air can also form blocks.\n\nFurther down, after adjusting the spreader, it mentions that you should load the machine when it's 10 cm above the ground. It also talks about using the loading platform if the distance between the container and the ground is more than 1250 mm. The height is specified in technical data on page 36.\n\nThen, under another section:\n- Drive the machine onto the loading platform with a maximum distance of 200 mm between the machine and the platform.\n- Make sure the machine isn't sitting on the ground but is at least 10 cm high.\n- Check if the dosing units are closed and close them if necessary by pressing the Stop button on the main display.\n\nIt also mentions that the position of the dosing units is shown on the main display. Then, you should turn off the electronic control system, shut down the spreader, remove the ignition key from the ignition lock, engage the parking brake, close all doors and windows in the cab, place undercarriage supports, adjust the loading platform so that the distance between it and the spreader is no more than 200 mm, open the cover, check if the sieves are closed and locked, and then fill the machine with appropriate aids up to the desired level.\n\nWait, I'm looking for the maximum chunk size. The context mentions that if during filling, either manually or with large bags, the distance between the container edge and the ground is more than 1250 mm, you must use the loading platform. So the maximum acceptable distance before needing the platform is 1250 mm.\n\nBut the question is about the chunk size to prevent blockage. Earlier, it says that most fertilizers can form blocks if they absorb water. The tips suggest working with a cover when wet and not leaving fertilizer too long in the spreader because of moisture.\n\nHowever, I don't see a specific number for the maximum chunk size directly. The closest is 1250 mm, which is the distance between the container edge and the ground before needing the loading platform. But that's about the height, not the chunk size itself.\n\nWait, maybe the blockage happens when the fertilizer forms large chunks. So perhaps the maximum acceptable size is related to how much can pass through without blocking. The context doesn't specify this directly but mentions 1250 mm as a threshold for using the loading platform.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 200 mm between the machine and the platform is relevant, but that's about the distance during operation, not the chunk size.\n\nI'm a bit confused. The question asks for the maximum acceptable chunk size in mm to prevent blockage. From the context, I don't see a specific number given for the chunk size itself, only for the height when using the loading platform (1250 mm) and the distance between machine and platform (200 mm).\n\nSince there's no direct information about the chunk size, maybe the answer is \"Not found in context\" or \"Unknown.\" But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1250 mm refers to the maximum height before needing the loading platform, which indirectly relates to preventing blockage. So maybe the maximum acceptable height is 1250 mm, but that's about the container, not the fertilizer chunks.\n\nI think there's no explicit information about the chunk size in the context provided. Therefore, I should respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer to prevent blockage. \n\nAnswer: Unknown",

        "question": "What is the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate?",
        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for the application rate. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context is in German, but I can understand some technical terms. It talks about spreading manure on fields and mentions different methods like one-sided over-dosing or under-dosing. There's a mention of two types of border spreading: Grenzabstreuen (border spreading) and Grenzaufstreuen (border application). \n\nIn the context, it says that during grenzabstreuen, you drive along the edge of the field and spread manure from the edge inward. It also mentions that the bedienungssystem (control system) doesn't perform automatic calibration during this process, so the dosage might not be exact. To compensate for this, they recommend first spreading the entire field and then the borders. This way, the control system can adjust the dosage correctly.\n\nThe key point here is that when doing border spreading, the application rate might not be as precise because the control system isn't calibrating during that specific operation. Therefore, to ensure the correct dosage, you should first spread the entire field and then apply the borders. This implies that by adjusting the driving speed or some other parameter, you can compensate for the application rate.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't provide exact numbers or percentages but rather mentions that the control system doesn't perform automatic calibration during border spreading. It suggests that by first spreading the entire field, the dosage can be set accurately, which indirectly implies that adjusting parameters like speed might help in maintaining the correct application rate.\n\nSince there's no specific percentage given, I have to infer based on standard practices or possible adjustments. Typically, in such systems, a reduction in driving speed could help in distributing the manure more evenly, but without exact data, it's hard to specify a precise percentage. Therefore, the answer might be that no specific percentage is provided, and the optimal adjustment would involve compensating through other means like initial full-field spreading.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information about an optimal driving speed reduction percentage for border spreading to compensate for application rate. However, it suggests that adjusting operations such as first spreading the entire field can help ensure accurate dosage.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

The reason given is to prevent dirt, artificial fertilizer, and water from getting into the storage areas.\n\nWait, but the question is about spring season preparation.

There's also a table listing parts like Getriebefett EP00/000 and specific oils like Shell Rodina 2 or Castrol GS2. But nothing here directly mentions vanes or their lifespan.\n\nMoving on to page 125, the main topic is maintenance intervals. The first table lists various maintenance tasks with numbers and descriptions. Let's go through each point:\n\n- Item 0: Control of screws and nuts.\n- Item 1: Control of the hydraulic system.\n- Item 2: Condition of the stirrer and stirrer shaft.\n- Item 3: Condition of the blades.\n- Item 4: Control and adjustment of the dosing mechanism.\n- Item 5: Control and adjustment of the discharge mechanism.\n- Item 6: Control and adjustment of the height of the discharge pipe.\n- Item 7: Adjustment of the discharge opening.\n- Item 8: Control and adjustment of the discharge pipe height.\n- Item 9: Greasing of four steering arm grease fittings.\n- Item 10: Grease four bellows on the gear housing.\n- Item 11: Grease two bellows on both discharge pipes.\n- Item 12: Grease one bellows on all four control arms.\n- Item 13: Adding or refilling fat.\n- Item 14: Greasing of joint shafts.\n- Item 15: Greasing of central gears.\n- Item 16: Greasing of the sprocket gears.\n- Item 17: Adding oil to the hydraulic system.\n- Item 18: Greasing of coupling parts in the sprocket gear housing.\n- Item 19: Replacement of parts.\n- Item 20: Replacement of hydraulic hoses and coupling parts.\n- Item 21: Checking the tightness of the stirrer shaft.\n- Item 22: Checking the condition of the stirrer.\n\nNone of these explicitly mention \"vanes.\" However, I recall that in machinery, vanes are often part of a system like hydraulics or pumps. Since there's no specific information about their operational hours, I need to infer based on standard practices.\n\nTypically, components like vanes in hydraulic systems might have service intervals based on usage. Without exact data, it's common for such parts to last several thousand hours before needing replacement. However, since the context doesn't provide specifics, I should stick to what's given or default to a standard estimate if unsure.\n\nBut wait, the user instructed to base the answer strictly on the context. Since there's no mention of vanes in the provided text, I shouldn't make assumptions beyond that. Therefore, the correct response is that the information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the typical lifespan of the agitator seal ring based on the operational hours before needing replacement. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 134, there's a section about maintenance involving the dosiermechanism. It mentions that the Dosiermechanismus must be mounted exactly in the middle over the Streuscheiben. There's also a mention of the R\u00fchrerwelle (agitator shaft) and Dichtungsring (seal ring). The image captions confirm these parts.\n\nMoving to page 134, under \"HINWEIS\" (advice), it talks about opening sieves and general maintenance steps. However, I'm looking for specific information about the seal ring's lifespan.\n\nOn page 134, there's a note: \"Sollten Sie die Siebe \u00f6ffnen...\" which translates to if you need to open the sieves... but that doesn't directly relate to the seal ring's lifespan.\n\nFurther down, under \"Befestigungsschraube,\" it mentions adjusting the position of the Dosiermechanismus. Again, this is about the mechanism's positioning, not the seal itself.\n\nWait, on page 134, there's a specific instruction: \"\u00dcberpr\u00fcfen Sie, ob der Abstand zwischen der R\u00fchrerwelle und dem Dichtungsring zu allen Seiten hin gleich ist.\" This translates to checking if the distance between the agitator shaft and the seal ring is equal on all sides. If not, adjustments can be made by moving the Dosiermechanismus.\n\nThis suggests that the seal ring's position and alignment are crucial for performance, implying that improper alignment could lead to issues. However, I'm still looking for how long it lasts before needing replacement.\n\nLooking back at page 134, there's a mention of \"nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden\" on page 133, which translates to after the first 10 operating hours. It says something about the Streubild (dispersion) of the left and right sieves differing more than 3%. This might relate to performance but not directly to the seal's lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. On page 134, under \"HINWEIS,\" there's a step: \"Sollten Sie die Siebe \u00f6ffnen...\" which is about opening sieves properly. But again, no direct info on the seal ring's lifespan.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the context doesn't explicitly state the typical lifespan of the seal ring in operational hours. It provides maintenance steps but not specific replacement intervals.\n\nGiven this, I should check if there's any mention of replacement intervals elsewhere. On page 133, it mentions \"nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden\" and \"nach allen 100 Betriebsstunden,\" which are after the first 10 hours and after 100 hours. It also talks about the Streubild differing more than 3%, leading to a reference on page 78.\n\nThis seems related to performance monitoring rather than component lifespan. The maintenance steps on page 134 don't specify when the seal ring needs replacing, only how to adjust it if misaligned.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no explicit information about the typical lifespan of the agitator seal ring in operational hours before replacement.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

One of the steps says: \"If not, then move the fixing point of the control lever to the dosing mechanism until a small gap between the dosing plates is visible.\" This suggests that when the dosing plates are closed correctly, there's a small space between them.\n\nThe question is about the dimension of this crack or gap.

Since it's a tool used for measurement, I can infer that the material should be durable and accurate.\n\nI don't see any specific materials mentioned in the context, so I might have to make an educated guess based on standard tools. Usually, feeler gauges are made from materials like stainless steel or hardened steel because they're resistant to wear and provide precise measurements. However, without explicit information, it's safer to say that the material isn't specified here.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the type of material recommended.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the material of the \"metal seal rings\" is for the agitator axle seal. Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see mentions of \"metal seal rings\" in a few places. On page 141, there's a section about maintenance. It says: \"Schrauben Sie die 3 Befestigungsschrauben von den Dichtungsringen ab.\" Translating that, it means \"screw off the 3 fixing screws from the seal rings.\" So, these are called \"Dichtungsringe,\" which I think refers to seal rings. The context doesn't specify if they're made of metal or another material.\n\nLooking further, there's a mention of \"Kunststoffdichtringe\" which translates to \"rubber seal rings.\" These are part of the maintenance steps and need to be replaced every season or 100 hours of operation. But that's about rubber, not metal.\n\nI don't see any explicit information stating that the metal seal rings are made of a specific material like steel or another metal. The context only refers to them as \"metal seal rings\" without specifying their composition. Since there's no additional detail, I can't confirm if they're made of a particular type of metal or something else.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I don't have enough details to determine the exact material of the metal seal rings beyond knowing they are metal.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the exact material of the \"metal seal rings\" for the agitator axle seal. While it refers to them as metal, there is no further detail provided about their composition.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context mentions several components related to ISO 11786, such as the 'In Cab' connection, and talks about Kabelsatz (cable set) options. It also discusses optional extension cables for the ISO 11786 'In Cab' Schlepperanschluss (tractor connection). \n\nLooking at page 144, there's a mention of \"Verl\u00e4ngerte ISO-Kabel\" which translates to extended ISO cables. The text says that these are available and can be used if needed. It also mentions that for a drawn steering system, an extended ISO cable is available, replacing the short one already installed.\n\nHowever, I don't see any specific measurements or lengths provided in the context. The information given is more about the availability of such cables rather than their exact length. There's no mention of meters or specific numbers, just that they are extended and can be used as replacements.\n\nSince there's no numerical data about the optimal length, I have to conclude that the answer isn't found in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

It mentions that the test period is a grace period during which the machine can be used with certain functionalities like Task Controller and Externe Dosis. The exact duration isn't specified here.\n\nI don't see any other pages in the context that provide specific information about the length of the free test period for GEOCONTROL software.

Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that on page 149, there's a mention of an \"Auffangbeh\u00e4lter\" (which translates to something like \"catch tank\") and an \"Ablass-Satz\" (\"dosing set\"). The text says that for precise manual dosing, an absorption test is needed, and the catch tank is essential. It also mentions that a dosing set is available for quick emptying of residual pesticides.\n\nNow, looking at page 148, there's information about the \"Sensor Beh\u00e4lter leer\" (sensor hopper empty), which triggers an alarm when the hopper is nearly empty. This sensor comes with the Ablass-Set, as mentioned on page 149.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the valve type and manufacturer for the valve set that comes with the hopper empty sensor. From the context, I don't see any direct mention of specific valves or their types. The terms used are \"Ablass-Satz\" (dosing set) and \"Sensor Beh\u00e4lter leer,\" but without more details on the components of the dosing set, it's unclear what type of valve is used.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the valves in the context provided, I can't confidently extract the exact model or manufacturer.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 150, there's mention of an \"Abdeckplane,\" which translates to \"cover\" or \"hopper cover.\" The text says that this Abdeckplane is made of a specific material and has certain properties. It mentions that it's used to protect the hopper from moisture and dirt, and it's either manually or electrically operated depending on the model.\n\nThe exact sentence is: \"Die Abdeckplane sch\u00fctzt den Kunstd\u00fcnger im K\u00fcbel gegen Feuchtigkeit und Schmutz.\" This translates to \"The cover protects the artificial fertilizer in the hopper against moisture and dirt.\"\n\nNow, regarding the material, the context doesn't explicitly state what kind of sail material is used. It only refers to it as \"Abdeckplane,\" which is a type of cover. Since the question asks about the sail material, but the context doesn't specify any particular fabric or material beyond referring to it as a cover, I might not have enough information.\n\nHowever, considering common materials for such covers in agricultural equipment, PVC or polyethylene are often used because they are durable and provide good protection against UV exposure. But since the context doesn't explicitly mention this, I shouldn't assume it unless it's stated.\n\nThe question also asks about UV resistance. The context mentions that the Abdeckplane is used to protect against moisture and dirt but doesn't specifically address UV resistance. Without explicit information, I can't provide details on UV resistance.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the given context, there isn't enough specific information to answer the question accurately regarding both the sail material and its UV resistance.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",
