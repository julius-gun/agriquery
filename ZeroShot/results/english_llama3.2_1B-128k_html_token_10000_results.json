A common range is around 0.5 to 2 liters per minute (L/min) for small to medium-sized hoppers with a capacity of 100-200 liters.\n\nA more precise answer would be:\n\n* For smaller hoppers: approximately 1-2 L/min\n* For larger hoppers: approximately 0.5-1 L/min\n\nPlease note that these values can vary depending on the specific application and machine specifications, so it's always best to consult the manufacturer's documentation or contact a professional for accurate information.",
