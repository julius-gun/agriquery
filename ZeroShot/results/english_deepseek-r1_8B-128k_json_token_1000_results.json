It also says that in order to finely adjust settings and counter blockages, a transition to the opening is needed. Additionally, it states that the spreader has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently.\n\nWait, I'm looking for how many dosing openings are closed during fine application. The context mentions that in fine application, a small dosing opening is used. It also talks about being able to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings to precisely set the application rate with a low flowrate. So, if there are 3 dosing openings and 2 are shut, that leaves 1 open.\n\nI think the key point here is that during fine application, two dosing openings are closed, leaving one open for precise dosing without blockages.\n</think>\n\nTwo dosing openings are closed during fine application.",

The computer in the distribution box compares these measurements with the set application rate and adjusts accordingly. So, the key part here is that weighcells are used for continuous measurement.\n\nI don't see any other systems mentioned on page 31 that relate to measuring fertilizer quantity beyond what's already covered.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how often the spreader performs automatic calibration tests. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of \"automatic calibration tests.\" Scanning through the text, I see a section titled \"Automatic Calibration test\" on page 31. That's a good starting point.\n\nIn that section, it says: \"With the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute...\" Hmm, so it mentions two intervals: every 75 kg and every minute. I need to clarify which one is the test interval.\n\nWait, the exact wording is a bit ambiguous. It says \"every 75 kg or every minute.\" So does it mean that each time the spreader dispenses 75 kg of fertilizer, it performs a calibration test? Or does it do it every minute regardless of the amount?\n\nLooking further, another part mentions: \"If the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.\" This suggests that the calibration is done when there's enough material (at least 75 kg) to perform it.\n\nSo putting it together, the spreader performs an automatic calibration test every time it dispenses 75 kg of fertilizer. Alternatively, it could be every minute, but given the context about the hopper content, I think it's triggered by reaching 75 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader carries out automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or every minute.\n\n**Answer:** The spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or every minute.",

It mentions that if the tractor lacks its own ISO terminal, it can be made ISOBUS ready with this set. Once converted, the tractor can then connect and operate with the IsoMatch control box.\n\nLooking specifically at how the speed is transmitted, there's a part that says if speed isn't measured on the machine itself but via the tractor, the speed sensor or adapter cable needs to be connected to IsoMatch. A special cable set is required for this purpose. It also refers to paragraph directly related to ISO 11786 in the tractor cabin on page 144.\n\nSo, putting it together, if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you can add the IsoMatch power cable set.

It also warns that if the ropes are too tight, especially when the power lift is in its lowest position, the quick coupling might accidentally disconnect. This could cause damage to the machine or even lead to personal injury.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n1. Decoupling ropes must not be tense.\n2. They need to provide sufficient freedom of movement.\n3. Even when the power lift is at the lowest point, there should still be enough slack to prevent accidental disconnection.\n\nThe question is asking specifically what must be ensured with these ropes during connection. From this, I can extract that the decoupling ropes must not be tense and must allow for movement, especially considering the power lift's position.\n</think>\n\nThe decoupling ropes must never be tense and should provide sufficient freedom of movement to prevent accidental disconnection, even when the power lift is in its lowest position.",

The key points here are: stopping spreading immediately and disconnecting the PTO shaft right away. There's also a reference to another paragraph on page 113 for more details.\n\nSo, focusing on the question about two actions during spreader failure, I need to extract exactly what is stated.

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mentions of pressure related to cleaning. The context has several sections about storing the machine, safety precautions, and maintenance tips. \n\nI see a section titled \"Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners.\" That's probably relevant. Let me check what it says. It mentions using only suitable cleaning tools and reading the safety instructions from the material manufacturer. Hmm, but that doesn't directly give the pressure limit.\n\nWait, there's another part in the context where it talks about releasing hydraulic system pressure before switching off the machine. But that's more about operation than cleaning. \n\nLooking again at the section on high-pressure cleaners, I notice a list item: \"\\uf034 Only use low pressure and temperature;\". The \"\\uf034\" might be an emoji or symbol, but in some contexts, it's used to denote a note or instruction. So, \"Only use low pressure and temperature\" seems important here.\n\nSince the question is about maximum allowable pressure, using low pressure implies that high pressure isn't allowed. Therefore, the maximum allowable pressure when cleaning would be low pressure, which I can infer as 0 bar if not specified otherwise. But wait, maybe it's more precise than that. If \"low pressure\" is the instruction, perhaps it's up to a certain limit, but since it's not specified numerically, I might have to say \"low pressure\" or state that high pressure isn't allowed.\n\nWait, in the context, after the list item about low pressure and temperature, there's another part where it says \"use only suitable cleaning tools.\" But no specific pressure is given. So, based on the instruction, the maximum allowable pressure when cleaning would be low, but without a numerical value, I can't specify bars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context implies that high-pressure cleaning isn't recommended, so the maximum allowable pressure is zero or very low. However, since it's not explicitly stated in numbers, perhaps the answer should reflect that only low pressure is allowed, which would be 0 bar if we consider that as the limit beyond which it's not allowed.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The instruction says to use low pressure and temperature, so the maximum allowable pressure when cleaning is low, but without a specific number, perhaps the answer is \"low pressure\" or \"not specified.\" However, since the question asks for bars, and only mentions low pressure, maybe it's 0 bar.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because using water at 0 bar would just be regular tap water. High-pressure cleaning usually refers to pressures above a certain level, like 100 psi or around 6-10 bar. But in the context, they specifically say \"low pressure,\" so maybe it's up to 3 bar or something. But without specific info, I can't be precise.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that high-pressure cleaning isn't allowed, so the maximum allowable pressure is 0 bar. Or maybe it's not specified, and the user should refer to the manufacturer's instructions. But since the question asks for the maximum allowable pressure in bars based on the context, and the context says \"low pressure,\" I think the answer would be that only low pressure can be used, so the maximum is low, but without a number, perhaps it's 0 bar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context implies that high-pressure cleaning isn't recommended, so the allowable pressure is zero. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should state that the maximum allowable pressure when cleaning with water or steam is \"low pressure\" as per the instructions, but without a specific number, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that only low pressure can be used, which would mean 0 bar if we consider that high-pressure cleaning isn't allowed. So, the maximum allowable pressure is 0 bar. But I'm not entirely certain because the context doesn't specify a numerical value beyond saying \"low pressure.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to say that the maximum allowable pressure isn't specified in the context and thus can't be determined. But the instruction says to provide an extremely precise answer, so perhaps stating 0 bar is acceptable.\n\nWait, no, because using water at 0 bar is just regular use. High-pressure cleaning usually refers to pressures above a certain level, but since it's not specified, maybe the answer is that only low pressure (e.g., up to 3 bar) is allowed, but without specifics, I can't say.\n\nI think I need to go with what's given: the context says \"low pressure and temperature,\" so the maximum allowable pressure when cleaning is low. Since it's not specified numerically, perhaps the answer is that only low pressure is allowed, which would be 0 bar if high-pressure isn't permitted.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum allowable pressure in bar when cleaning the",

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see there's a table with different models: \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" and two numbers, probably model numbers like 1875 and 2550. Each of these has various specifications listed from 0 to 20.\n\nLooking at the 3225 model isn't directly mentioned, but maybe it's part of the 1875 or 2550 entries. Wait, I don't see a 3225 in the context. The closest is \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" with numbers like 1875 and 2550.\n\nI need to check if there's any mention of hopper weight without cover for these models. Scanning through the table:\n\nFor model 1875, under key 9, it says \"\", so no data. Key 10 is \"277,5\", which might be with the cover. Similarly, model 2550 has key 9 as \"\" and key 10 as \"307,5\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question is about a 3225 model, but that's not listed here. So perhaps it's not available in this context.\n\nI should check if there's any mention of the 3225 elsewhere. In the table items, only 1875 and 2550 are present. No 3225 is mentioned, so maybe it's not covered here.\n\nTherefore, since the exact model isn't listed, I can't find the hopper weight without cover for the 3225.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

Each model has various specifications listed from 0 to 20.\n\nLooking at the 1875 model, under item number 6, it says \"Maximum load capacity (kg)\" is 3900. That seems relevant because the question is about the weight of the GEOSPREAD 3900.\n\nWait, but the model in question is Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900, which might be a different model than 1875. However, I don't see any entry for 3900 specifically. The closest is the 1875 model with a maximum load of 3900 kg.\n\nI should check if there's another section that mentions the weight directly. Scanning through, I don't find an exact match for \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900\" or its weight elsewhere in the context.\n\nSince the question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 and not the 1875 model, but the only relevant information given is under 1875 with a max load of 3900 kg, I'm unsure if this applies to the model in question.

        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction factor. Let me start by understanding what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is M18, which refers to its size\u2014M stands for metric, and 18 indicates the thread size in millimeters. So it's an 18mm diameter bolt.\n\nNext, the quality is 10.9. I remember that in bolts, the quality or grade refers to strength properties. A 10.9 grade means the bolt has a tensile strength of 10.9 MPa (megapascals). This is important because it tells me how much force the bolt can handle before it breaks.\n\nThen there's the friction factor of 0.13. Friction in bolts is crucial for ensuring that the bolt doesn't come loose over time due to vibrations or movement. A higher friction factor means the bolt will hold tighter, which is generally better for applications where the bolt might be subject to a lot of stress.\n\nNow, I need to find the torque required to fasten this bolt. Torque is usually specified in Newton-meters (Nm). The context provided has tables with different combinations of thread sizes and friction factors, along with corresponding torques.\n\nLooking at the tables, I see that there are multiple entries for various parameters. The question specifies a 0.13 friction factor, so I should focus on rows where this value is present.\n\nI notice that in the table labeled \"Torques.10.9.0,10.\", which seems to correspond to a 10.9 quality bolt with a 0.10 friction factor, but wait, our question has a 0.13 friction factor. Hmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another table that matches the 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. Let me check again. The tables are:\n\n- Torques.4.6.0,10.\n- Torques.4.6.0,13.\n- Torques.8.8.0,10.\n- Torques.8.8.0,13.\n- Torques.10.9.0,10.\n- Torques.10.9.0,13.\n\nThe last two are for 10.9 quality. The first digit after the dot seems to indicate something\u2014maybe the friction factor? Let's see:\n\nFor example, \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" might be for a 4.6 grade with 0 friction or something else. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the second number after the dot is the thread size in some format. For instance, M18 would correspond to size 18, so maybe that's where it comes into play.\n\nLooking at \"Torques.10.9.0,10.\", the first part is 10.9, which matches our bolt quality. The next number is 0, and then 10. Maybe this represents something like a standard or specific condition.\n\nBut I'm looking for a friction factor of 0.13. Let me check if any table has that. Scanning through, I don't see a 0.13 directly. However, the question specifies 0.13, so perhaps it's implied in one of these tables.\n\nWait, maybe the first number after the dot is the thread size, and the second is the friction factor. For example, \"Torques.10.9.0,10.\" could be for a 10.9 grade, size 9 (but that doesn't match M18), or perhaps it's not directly tied to the size.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about an M18 bolt with 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. Looking at the tables, the closest match seems to be \"Torques.10.9.0,10.\" which has a torque value of 7 Nm for size 0 (maybe standard conditions) and 13 Nm for higher conditions.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies a 0.13 friction factor, so perhaps I need to look for that in the tables. If none have 0.13, maybe it's not provided here, or perhaps the answer is \"Not found in context.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.13 is part of another parameter, and the torque can be inferred from the closest table.\n\nWait, let me check again. The tables are structured with keys like \"Torques.10.9.0,10.\" which might correspond to a specific condition. If I'm looking for 10.9 quality, 0.13 friction, perhaps it's in the \"Torques.10.9.0,13.\" table.\n\nLooking at that table:\n\n{\n  \"0\": \"8\",\n  \"1\": \"15\",\n  \"2\": \"36",

        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque = Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Force \u00d7 Diameter. But wait, in this context, it's probably referring to standard formulas for bolts. Maybe it's better to look at the table provided in the context.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several tables listed under \"Torques\" with different parameters. The question mentions an M6 bolt, so I should focus on the rows that have M6. Scanning through, I see a section labeled \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" which corresponds to 4.6.0 and 10, probably referring to some standard or class of bolts.\n\nIn this table, for each diameter (from M5 to M24), there are two torque values: one at 10 Nm and another at 13 Nm. Since the question specifies a 0.2 friction coefficient, I need to find which torque value corresponds to that.\n\nLooking at \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\", the torques for each diameter are listed as:\n- M5: 1.7\n- M6: 3\n- M8: 8\n- M10: 27\n- M12: 42\n- M14: 65\n- M16: 90\n- M18: 125\n- M20: 170\n- M22: 210\n\nWait, but the question is about an M6 bolt. So for M6, it's 3 Nm at 10. But I'm not sure if this is with a specific friction coefficient. The context doesn't explicitly state that these torques are based on a 0.2 coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, looking further down, there's \"Torques.4.6.0,13.\" which has:\n- M5: 2\n- M6: 3\n- M8: 9\n- M10: 27\n- etc.\n\nWait, that seems similar to the previous table but at a different torque level (13 instead of 10). Maybe these are two different standards or classes. The question mentions \"with a 0.2 friction,\" so perhaps I need to find which torque corresponds to that coefficient.\n\nBut in the tables provided, I don't see any mention of friction coefficients; they just list torques for each diameter. So maybe the context assumes a standard friction coefficient, and the 0.2 is part of the question's parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" and \"Torques.4.6.0,13.\" are for different types of bolts or threads. Since the question specifies an M6 hexagon bolt with A2 quality and 0.2 friction, I need to find which torque value applies.\n\nLooking again, in \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\", M6 is 3 Nm, and in \"Torques.4.6.0,13.\", M6 is also 3 Nm. Hmm, that's the same. Maybe these are for different head types or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the torque with a 0.2 friction coefficient. Since the tables don't specify coefficients, maybe the context assumes a standard value, and the 0.2 is given in the question as an additional parameter.\n\nBut without explicit data on how the friction coefficient affects the torque values in the tables, I might need to infer that the 3 Nm for M6 is the correct answer regardless of the coefficient, or perhaps it's already adjusted for a standard coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.2 friction is part of the question and needs to be considered separately. If so, using the formula Torque = (Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Diameter) / something, but without more info, I can't calculate it directly from the tables.\n\nWait, perhaps the tables are for standard torques based on specific standards or classes, and the 0.2 is an additional parameter that might not be reflected in the table data provided. In that case, maybe the answer isn't directly extractable from the context.\n\nBut the instructions say to base the answer strictly on the context. Since the tables don't mention friction coefficients, I can't use them to adjust the torque. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 3 Nm as per \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" for M6, assuming that's the standard torque regardless of coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the 0.2 friction is a clue that it's a different class or standard, but without more info, I can't be sure. So maybe the answer is 3",

These actuators allow accurate dosing regardless of driving speed and can be controlled by software or external sensors like nitrogen sensors.\n\nFurther down, it mentions that the spreader software controls the actuators and uses weight sensors to measure discharge volumes and adjust application rates as needed.

It requires small dosing openings to finely adjust settings and prevent blockages.\n\nNow, looking at the question: Is fine application more expensive than normal dosing?\n\nI don't see any direct information about costs or pricing in the context provided. The focus is on technical features like actuators, application rates, and how the spreader operates for different dosing methods. There's no mention of financial aspects, expenses, or cost differences between fine application and normal dosing.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there's no information that would allow me to determine if fine application is more expensive than normal dosing.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section titled \"Setting the hydraulic border spreading plate.\" Within this section, several steps are outlined. One of these steps mentions closing the tap to prevent unintentional lifting of the plate while working. The exact text is: \"\\uf034 Close the tap to prevent unintentional lifting of the plate while working.\"\n\nNow, I'm trying to understand what \"tap\" refers to here. In hydraulic systems, a \"tap\" is often a component that controls the flow or pressure of fluid. It's used to control the movement or function of hydraulic components, like cylinders or plates.\n\nIn this context, closing the tap would mean stopping the flow of hydraulic fluid to the plate, which prevents it from being lifted unintentionally. This makes sense because if the tap isn't closed, the plate might rise due to pressure, which could be dangerous or inefficient.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the \"tap\" is a hydraulic component used to control the movement of the border spreading plate. It's likely a part that can be adjusted to regulate the flow of fluid, ensuring the plate stays in place when not in use.\n</think>\n\nThe tap material refers to a hydraulic component used to control the movement of the border spreading plate. It is employed to prevent unintentional lifting by stopping the flow of hydraulic fluid when not in use.\n\n**Answer:** The tap is a hydraulic component used to control the plate's movement, preventing unintended lifting by stopping fluid flow.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what type of feeler gauge material is recommended for checking the discharge bushing height. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about checking and setting the discharge bushing height. It mentions that the distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be exactly 1.0 mm. If it's too great or too short, it can cause issues like disrupted spreading patterns or machine damage.\n\nNow, the question is specifically asking about the material of the feeler gauge used for this check. The context doesn't explicitly mention a feeler gauge, but it does talk about measurements and adjustments. Since precise measurement is crucial here, I might infer that a feeler gauge is commonly used for such tasks in machinery. However, without explicit information about the material, I can't be certain.\n\nI should check if there's any part of the context that refers to tools or gauges used in this process. The context discusses safety precautions and adjustments but doesn't specify the type of tool. Therefore, since the exact recommendation isn't provided, the answer would likely be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not explicitly mention the material for a feeler gauge used to check discharge bushing height. \n\n**Answer:** Not found in context",

One of them mentions removing the metal seal rings. Another one says to remove the metal seal rings again after putting back the fastening bolts. So, it seems like these are parts that can be taken off and put back on.\n\nThe question is specifically about the material of these metal seal rings. The context doesn't explicitly state whether they're made of a specific type of metal, like stainless steel or another alloy. It just refers to them as \"metal seal rings.\" There's no additional information provided about their composition beyond them being called metal.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of the material beyond them being metal, I can't specify further.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a mention of an \"optional extension cable\" that can be mounted on the ISO 11786 in-cab connection. The text says: \"You can mount an optional extension cable to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection on the 7-point plug 'Input IM Tellus' cable supplied as a standard item.\" \n\nHmm, so it's talking about an extension cable being used with the ISO 11786 setup. But I don't see any specific measurements or lengths mentioned here. The context also mentions that an extended ISO cable is available for a tractor-trailed spreader, replacing the short cable already fitted. It says to exchange the whole cable.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about the length of this extension cable. Since there's no numerical value provided in the context, I can't extract any specific measurement. The context only mentions that an extended ISO cable is available without giving its length.\n\nSo, based on the information given, there's no data about the optimal length of the extension cable.

The context includes sections about different software like Spreader control software, GEOCONTROL, IsoMatch Grip, and Handle control. There are also mentions of accessories and purchasing information through the IsoMatch shop.\n\nLooking specifically for the GEOCONTROL software, I see that it's described as an advanced application for precise and efficient use of fertiliser spreaders. The context also mentions that a user licence can be purchased after the free test period expires. \n\nNow, I need to find out how long this free test period is. Scanning through the text, I notice a section about \"Site-dependent control of your GEOSPREADER\" which talks about automatic headland control and working width reduction with gored spreading, requiring additional software. It says, \"you require additional software. See the website www.isomatchshop.com.\"\n\nWait, that's about additional software but doesn't specify the duration. Let me check another part. There's a mention of a user licence being purchased via the IsoMatch shop after the free test period expires. However, there's no specific number of days given here.\n\nI don't see any direct information about the duration in the provided context. The only reference is that it's a free test period before the licence needs to be purchased, but without a specific timeframe like 30 days or 60 days.\n\nSo, based on the context, there's no exact number of days provided for the test period.
