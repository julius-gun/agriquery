        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how a tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to IsoMatch if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context mentions several sections related to machinery, specifically about ISO-Schlepper (ISO tractors) and ISOBUS functions. It talks about how ISOBUS allows communication between the tractor's terminal or ISO control panel and the machine, enabling location-based processing and responses to varying field conditions and soil conditions through sensors like GPS.\n\nNow, the question is asking how a tractor without ISOBUS can still send its driving speed to IsoMatch. From the context, I see that there's a section titled \"ISOBUS-Schlepperanschluss\" which discusses how ISOBUS facilitates communication functions and data transfer between the tractor or ISO control panel and the machine.\n\nBut since the tractor lacks ISOBUS, it must be using an alternative method. Looking further, there's a section about \"Nicht-ISO Schlepper mit IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz anpassen,\" which translates to \"Non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power supply sets.\" This suggests that even without ISOBUS, the tractor can connect using IsoMatch components.\n\nSpecifically, it mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, they can add an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz (power supply set). This setup allows the tractor to communicate with IsoMatch. The context also talks about connecting sensors like the speed sensor via an adapter cable to the IsoMatch system.\n\nSo, putting it together, when a tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, it can still send its driving speed to IsoMatch by using an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz, which provides the necessary power and connectivity. This setup allows for communication between the tractor and IsoMatch without relying on ISOBUS.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to IsoMatch via an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz when ISOBUS communication is absent. This setup enables the connection needed for data transfer, allowing the speed information to be communicated effectively.",

The key part here is about the working angles of this component.\n\nLooking at the text, it says: \"Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Arbeitswinkel der Gelenkwelle betr\u00e4gt nach oben 30 \u00b0 und 30 \u00b0 nach unten.\" Translating that, it means the maximum operating angle for the coupling shaft is 30 degrees above and below. So when lifted (above) and lowered (below), the angle doesn't exceed 30 degrees each time.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other numbers or conditions. The context also talks about the length of the coupling shaft needing to be just right to prevent damage, but that's more about the physical length rather than the angle. There's no mention of a different maximum angle elsewhere, so 30 degrees seems consistent for both positions.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other sections or numbers that might affect this answer. The context includes some steps on how to attach the coupling shaft and maintain it, but nothing changes the operating angle specified here. So I'm confident that 30 degrees is the correct maximum permissible angle when lifted and lowered.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum permissible operating angle for the coupling shaft is **30 degrees** both when lifted and lowered.\n\nAnswer:  \n30 degrees",

Unintended disengagement could cause machine damage or injuries.\n\nLooking through the context, there are specific steps listed for connecting a power lift. One of them is about ensuring the decoupling ropes aren't too tight and have enough movement.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer in kg/min based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 68, there's a section titled \"Dosierstellung\" which translates to Dosage Setting. Within this section, there are several bullet points and text items that describe how to determine the dosage. \n\nOne of the bullet points mentions: \u00b7 Aus der betreffenden Streutabelle ablesen, wenn Sie eine geringe Dosis verstreuen m\u00f6chten, bei der Sie das Feindosier-Set verwenden und in der Streutabelle hinter dem Symbol Feindosier-Set angegeben ist; dies wird durch 1 offene \u00d6ffnung (Dosier\u00f6ffnung) angegeben. This seems to explain that from the relevant dosage table, you can read the dosage if you want a small dose using the Enemy Dosage Set, indicated by 1 open opening.\n\nAnother bullet point talks about determining an unspecified dosage via \"Auslass\u00f6ffnung\" on page 65. \n\nThen there's a text item: Da 2 von den 3 Dosier\u00f6ffnungen geschlossen sind, muss die Auslassgeschwindigkeit durch die verbleibende Dosier\u00f6ffnung 3-mal so gro\u00df sein, um die gleiche Dosis zu verstreuen. This translates to Since two of the three dosage openings are closed, the outflow speed must be three times as large through the remaining opening to spread the same dose.\n\nAnother bullet point: \uf034 Lesen Sie Dosierstellung, Auslass\u00f6ffnung und Durchsatz aus der Streutabelle ab. Berechnen Sie ggf. den erforderlichen Durchsatz mit der nachstehenden Formel. So, read dosage setting, outflow and throughput from the table. Calculate the required throughput using the following formula if necessary.\n\nThen there's a text item: Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha). This translates to Required outflow speed (kg/min) = Work width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Yielding amount (kg/ha).\n\nAnother bullet point: Nehmen Sie f\u00fcr die Einstellung der Auslass\u00f6ffnung den Buchstaben, der in der Zeile der Streutabelle angegeben ist, der Auslassgeschwindigkeit am n\u00e4chsten kommt. Take the letter from the row of the dosage table that best matches the outflow speed.\n\nThen there are bullet points about calculating throughput: \n- Multiply the throughput (in kg/min column or calculated) by factor 3.\n- Take the most comparable throughput value from the kg/min column for the entire sprayer.\n- Read the corresponding dosage setting or estimate it.\n\nPutting this together, the formula mentioned is Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit = Arbeitsbreite x Fahrgeschwindigkeit x Ausbringmenge. So, the required flow rate in kg/min is calculated by multiplying work width (m), driving speed (km/h), and yielding amount (kg/ha).\n\nI need to make sure this formula directly answers the question about calculating the fertilizer flow rate. Yes, it does.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is:\n\n**Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)**",

The context is in German, but I can read it fine. It seems to be about operating instructions for some machinery, possibly related to a hopper or feeder.\n\nLooking at the text items, there's one that says: \"Wenn w\u00e4hrend des Bef\u00fcllens, manuell oder mit gro\u00dfen S\u00e4cken, der Abstand zwischen Beh\u00e4lterrand und Boden gr\u00f6\u00dfer als 1250 mm ist, m\u00fcssen Sie die Ladeplattform verwenden.\" \n\nBreaking this down, it translates to: \"If during filling, manually or using large bags, the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is greater than 1250 mm, you must use the loading platform.\"\n\nSo, the key part here is that if the distance exceeds 1250 mm, a platform is required. The question asks for the maximum distance before a platform is mandatory. That would be exactly 1250 mm.\n\nI don't see any other numbers in the context related to this specific question. All other mentions are about filling procedures or technical data on page 36, which isn't directly relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the maximum allowed distance without needing a platform is 1250 mm.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum allowable distance between the hopper rim and the ground before a platform becomes mandatory is **1250 mm**.",

One is about avoiding contact with art materials and other tools when filling, adjusting, or testing the spreader. It suggests wearing protective clothing and following safety instructions because of potential injuries from these interactions.\n\nAnother point talks about a \"Quetschgefahr\", which I think means \"pinching danger\" or something similar, related to adjusting the spreader. It lists steps like shutting off the engine, engaging the parking brake, waiting for parts to stop moving before adjusting, and being cautious when performing these actions alone.\n\nThere's also a section about not operating the machine while others are nearby because it can cause injuries. Another part mentions environmental protection by using the right dosage and method to avoid polluting the environment.\n\nLastly, there's something about the transmission continuing to run after shutting off, which could be dangerous if parts move back, leading to potential harm from a moving machine.\n\nPutting this together, the tray test seems to check several safety aspects. It ensures that when the spreader is adjusted or tested, it doesn't cause injuries due to moving parts or contact with harmful substances. It also emphasizes safe operating practices and environmental considerations.\n\nSo, the tray test likely checks if the spreader can be safely adjusted without causing pinching or movement-related injuries, ensuring proper safety measures are in place, and that the machine is operated alone to prevent accidents.\n</think>\n\nThe tray test on a fertilizer spreader checks whether it can be safely adjusted and tested without causing injuries from moving parts or contact with harmful substances.

The context is in German, but I can read it fine. It's about safety precautions when working on machinery, specifically a slepper (probably a type of tractor or similar equipment). \n\nLooking at the items, there are several TextItems and SectionHeaders. The question is about what continues to be dangerous after disengaging the PTO shaft. \n\nI see that one of the TextItems mentions: \"After switching off the PTO, danger can arise due to the machine's inertia causing it to continue moving.\" That seems relevant.\n\nSo, the key point is that even after turning off the PTO (which likely powers moving parts), the machine might keep moving because of its mass or inertia. This could be dangerous if someone is near or not properly secured.\n\nI need to make sure this directly answers the question without adding extra information. The answer should state the continued danger and why it happens.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, a continued danger arises due to the machine's inertia, which can cause it to continue moving.

Also, for dosages below 50 kg per hectare, they mention that you might need to lower the minimum hopper content to as low as 15 kg. So, the main points are that automatic calibration is disabled when the hopper is under 100 kg, and for very low dosages, you can adjust the minimum required in the hopper further down to 15 kg.\n\nI should make sure I'm only including the specific information related to the question and nothing extra.

It mentions that after determining the form and surface of the fertilizer, one should look at the specific weight to set up a spread table that matches the best with their artificial fertilizer. Then there's a section header about working before spreading, followed by instructions on determining the type of fertilizer based on its shape and surface.\n\nLooking further down, I see a list of types like Granulat, Prills, Kristalin, Mix, Pellets, Saat Schneckenk\u00f6rner, and Mineralisch. Each of these has corresponding Form (shape) and Oberfl\u00e4che (surface) descriptions.\n\nThe question is specifically about the pattern for 'mineral'. In the context, under the type \"Mineralisch\", there's a Form entry: \"einwandfrei rund, innen hohl, manchmal kleine L\u00f6cher an der Oberfl\u00e4che\" which translates to \"round without issues, hollow inside, sometimes small holes on the surface.\" The Oberfl\u00e4che for Mineralisch is not explicitly mentioned beyond that.\n\nSo, putting this together, the pattern for 'mineral' seems to be round with possible internal hollow areas and minor surface imperfections.

        "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and with a 0.13 friction be fastened?",
        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part of this means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is an M18, which refers to its metric size. The \"hexagon\" part tells me it's a hexagonal head bolt, which is common in many applications. The \"steel bolt\" indicates that it's made of steel, so I might need to consider material properties like tensile strength.\n\nNext, the 10.9 quality probably refers to the strength class of the bolt. In ISO standards, 10.9 means a tensile strength of 10.9 MPa (megapascals). This is important because it tells me how much force the bolt can handle before it starts to strip or become loose.\n\nThe friction coefficient given is 0.13. Friction affects how much torque is needed to overcome it when tightening the bolt. A higher coefficient means more torque is required because there's more resistance between the bolt and the hole it's being screwed into.\n\nLooking at the context provided, I see a table that lists various Anzugsmomente (which translates to \"fastening moments\" or torque values) for different quality levels and sizes. The structure of the table seems to be:\n\n- The first column is the Quality.Reibung (friction class), denoted by numbers like 0.Gewinde, which I think refers to the hole size in millimeters.\n- The second column lists the Anzugsmomente values for different quality levels, such as 4.6 or 8.8.\n\nWait, but in the context, it's structured with keys like \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10.\" and corresponding values. I'm not entirely sure what the numbers mean after Anzugsmomente., but perhaps they denote specific torque values for each size and quality level.\n\nI need to find the row where the hole size is M18 (which would be 18 mm) and the quality level that corresponds to a friction coefficient of 0.13. Looking through the context, I see entries like \"Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,10.\" which might correspond to a specific torque value for M10 bolts with a certain quality.\n\nWait, maybe each key after Anzugsmomente is broken down into parts. For example, \"4.6.0\" could be a code where 4 refers to the quality level, 6 to the type, and 0 to something else. But I'm not entirely sure without more context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each main entry under Anzugsmomente corresponds to different torque values for various sizes. For example, \"Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,10.\" might be for M10 bolts with a certain quality level, and the numbers after that are the torque values in Nm.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the row where the hole size is M18 (which would correspond to index 7 since M sizes go from M4 to M24, so M18 is the 8th item if starting at M4 as 0). Wait, no, looking back, the first column lists \"Qualit\u00e4t.Reibung *.Gewinde:\" with values like M5, M6 up to M24. So each number corresponds to a specific hole size.\n\nSo for example:\n- Index 0: M5\n- Index 1: M6\n- ...\n- Index 7: M18\n\nTherefore, the row for M18 would be index 7. Now, looking at the rows under \"Anzugsmomente\", I need to find which one corresponds to M18 and the correct quality level.\n\nLooking through the context:\n\n- Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10.: This seems to have values starting from 1.7 Nm up to 210 Nm.\n- Anzugsmomente.8.8.0,13.: Values go from 6 Nm up to 710 Nm.\n- Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,10.: From 7 Nm up to 860 Nm.\n- Anzugsmomente.12.: Not fully provided.\n\nWait, perhaps each main key like \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10.\" refers to a specific combination of quality and type. Maybe the numbers after the decimal points are codes for different aspects.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the question mentions 10.9 quality, I should look for rows with \"10.9\" in their keys. The only one provided is \"Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,10.\" which has values from 7 to 860 Nm.\n\nAssuming that this row corresponds to M10 bolts, but we need M18. So perhaps I'm missing the correct",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section about \"Anzugsmomente Stahl,\" which translates to something like \"Torque Values for Steel Bolts.\" Under this, there are several tables with different torque values corresponding to various screw sizes and qualities.\n\nLooking at the first table labeled \"Qualit\u00e4t.Reibung *.Gewinde\" (Quality.Friction.Tension), it lists M5 to M24 bolts. Each row corresponds to a specific bolt size. The numbers next to each size seem to be the maximum tension in Nm. For example, M6 has 1.7 Nm.\n\nNext, there's another table for \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10.\" which I think refers to a specific standard or category (4.6.0) with a tensile strength of 10. The values here are higher: M6 is 3 Nm, increasing up to M24 at 210 Nm.\n\nAnother table for \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,13.\" has even higher torque values, starting at 2 Nm for M6 and going up to 250 Nm for M24.\n\nThere's also a table for \"Anzugsmomente.8.8.0,10.\" with torques from 5 Nm (M6) to 600 Nm (M24), and another for \"Anzugsmomente.8.8.0,13.\" starting at 6 Nm.\n\nThe last table is \"Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,10.\" with torques from 7 Nm (M6) to 860 Nm (M24), and \"Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,13.\" starting at 8 Nm.\n\nSince the question specifies an M6 bolt with A2 quality and a friction coefficient of 0.2, I need to find which table applies here. The A2 quality likely corresponds to one of these tables, probably the ones under \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0\" or \"Anzugsmomente.8.8.0.\" \n\nLooking at the first table for \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10.\", M6 is 3 Nm. The second one for \"13.\" has M6 at 2 Nm. Since A2 might be a standard that falls under either of these, but without more context, it's tricky.\n\nHowever, the question mentions a friction coefficient of 0.2, which isn't directly listed in the tables. But looking at the first table, M6 is 1.7 Nm, and considering the friction, maybe we need to calculate using torque = tension / (friction + 1). If the tension is from the A2 standard, say 70 Nm, then torque would be 70 / (0.2 + 1) \u2248 35 Nm.\n\nWait, but in the tables, M6 for \"4.6.0,10.\" is 3 Nm and for \"13.\" it's 2 Nm. If A2 corresponds to a higher category like 13., then torque would be 2 Nm. But considering the friction, maybe we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tables already account for some factors, so if M6 is 3 Nm in one table and 2 in another, with A2 being a standard that might fall under 4.6.0,10., then torque would be 3 Nm.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure which category A2 falls into. Without more info, it's hard to pinpoint the exact value. However, based on the tables, M6 for \"4.6.0,10.\" is 3 Nm and for \"13.\" is 2 Nm. If A2 corresponds to a higher category like 13., then torque would be lower.\n\nBut since the question specifies A2 and 0.2 friction, maybe we need to calculate it as tension / (friction + 1). If the standard gives a certain tension, say 70 Nm, then torque would be 70 / 1.2 \u2248 58.3 Nm. But that's not matching any table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tables already include the necessary calculations, so if M6 is listed as 3 Nm in one table and 2 in another, considering A2 might require a higher torque, maybe it's 3 Nm.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. I think the best approach is to look for an exact match in the tables. Since the question specifies A2 and 0.2 friction",

Let me start by understanding what one-sided boundary spreading means in this context. From the context provided, it seems like boundary spreading involves using a tool that distributes fertilizer or chemicals along the edges of a field, ensuring even coverage without overlap.\n\nLooking at the context, there's mention of the GEOSPREAD function and how it can be used with a grenzstreublech (boundary spreader). The text says that by adjusting the position of the boundary spreader, you can optimize the distribution and reduce environmental impact. It also mentions that with a hydraulic boundary spreader, even left-side spreading is possible.\n\nNow, considering small gardens, I need to see if this method is applicable. The context doesn't explicitly mention one-sided boundary spreading but talks about optimizing the spread pattern. However, it does say that with the right adjustments, you can achieve full coverage and minimize environmental impact. This suggests that regardless of the size, as long as the equipment is set up correctly, boundary spreading can be effective.\n\nI don't see any information restricting this method to large areas or excluding small ones.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see there's a section about Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen, which translates to something like single-plate boundary spreading. It mentions using a hydraulic border spreading plate as an accessory. The function of this is explained in the context.\n\nThe key points are that during Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen, you drive along the field edge and use the hydraulic border spreading plate to direct the flow of fertilizer grains. You adjust the position of the plate to set the width at the field edge. There are two directions mentioned: one where less is applied at the edge (direction X) and another where more is applied (direction 9). The maximum allowed loss over the edge is 10% according to environmental norms.\n\nNow, the question is about seven-sided boundary spreading with a hydraulic border plate. I'm not sure if \"seven-sided\" refers to the number of sides on the plate or something else. Looking at the context, it doesn't mention seven sides but talks about adjusting the position for width. Maybe \"seven-sided\" is a term used elsewhere, but based on the given text, the focus is on using the hydraulic border plate to spread along the field edge.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer should explain that seven-sided boundary spreading involves using the hydraulic border plate to distribute fertilizer along the field's edge by adjusting its position. The key points are the method of application and the adjustment for width.\n</think>\n\nSeven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate involves using the accessory to distribute fertilizer along the field's edge by adjusting its position, allowing for precise control over the width of application.",

There's a section titled \"Einsatz auf dem Feld\" which translates to \"Use on the field,\" discussing how to use the ExactLine while driving.\n\nLooking further, under \"Beendigung der Arbeiten\" or \"End of work,\" there are several listed measures. These include shutting down the dosing units, turning off the hydraulic pump, switching off the electronic control system, disengaging the winch and removing the ignition key from the lock, engaging the parking brake, clearing the machine of crop residues, covering it with a tarp, and taking all necessary road transport measures.\n\nThe question specifically asks about measures for road transport when stopping work.

It starts with \"Einsatz auf dem Feld,\" which means \"Application on the field.\" Then there are several bullet points listing causes of blockages or issues with fertilizers.\n\nLooking at the list:\n- A hard object blocks the shovel.\n- A hard object or a large chunk of artificial fertilizer partially blocks the delivery to the shovel.\n- A hard object or a large chunk of artificial fertilizer blocks the flow through dosing openings or discharge pipes.\n- Ground-down and/or wet fertilizer forms a crust under the mixer and blocks the flow through dosing openings.\n- Wet fertilizer in the discharge pipe has formed a block and blocks the flow through the opening, especially if the feeder isn't cleaned thoroughly after use.\n\nThen there's another section about handling the machine carefully, avoiding injuries because parts might be hot or under tension. It also mentions not to leave fertilizer in the feeder for long because moisture in the air can cause blocks. Reiniging the feeder thoroughly is advised.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about why fertilizers attract water. From the context, it seems that wetness in the fertilizer leads to blockages. For example, \"vermahlener und/oder feuchter Kunstd\u00fcnger bilden eine verkrustete Schicht unter dem R\u00fchrer\" which translates to \"grounded and/or wet fertilizer forms a crust under the mixer.\" Also, \"feuchter Kunstd\u00fcnger im Auslaufrohr hat einen Brocken gebildet\" means \"wet fertilizer in the discharge pipe has formed a block.\"\n\nSo, it seems that when fertilizer is wet, it can form crusts or blocks which cause issues. Therefore, the reason fertilizers attract water is because moisture leads to these blockages.\n</think>\n\nMost types of fertilizer attract water because wetness can lead to the formation of crusts or blockages under certain conditions.",

Then, further down, I see a table with headers like \"6+0\", \"6+1\", etc., and corresponding values under \"kg/min\". The rows are labeled with letters C, D, E.\n\nWait, the question is about the specific type of slug pellets used for the spreading chart example. In the context, there's a section where it talks about the recommended settings for spreading. It mentions using the Feindosier-Set and that the dosage settings are based on that, so you don't need to recalculate.\n\nBut I'm looking for the specific type of Delicia Schnecken Linsen used in the example. The context shows a table with different combinations of 6+0 up to 12+3, each corresponding to kg/min and letters C, D, E. Each letter probably represents a different type or setting.\n\nSince the question is about the specific type used in the example, I need to identify which letter corresponds to the example given. The context mentions that at 12 meters width, 8 km/h speed, and 23 kg/ha dosage, the recommended settings are: D for the outlet opening, 13 for the dosage position, 3.7 kg/min discharge rate, and using the Feindosier-Set.\n\nLooking back at the table, under \"6+0\" to \"12+3\", each row has a letter (C, D, E) corresponding to different kg/min values. The example uses 12 meters width, so looking at the rows starting with 12: 12+0, 12+1, etc.\n\nIn the table, for 12+0, it's C; 12+1 is D; 12+2 is E.

One of them mentions that most types of artificial fertilizers absorb water and can form large blocks, which might cause issues with the spreader or the structure.\n\nLooking further down, under the section \"HINWEIS,\" which I think is a German term for advice or note, there are specific points listed as bullet points. The third point says: \u00b7 Lassen Sie Kunstd\u00fcnger nie lange im Streuer. Durch Feuchtigkeit in der Luft k\u00f6nnen ebenfalls Brocken entstehen. This translates to \"Never let artificial fertilizer stay in the spreader for a long time because moisture in the air can also form blocks.\"\n\nBut I'm specifically looking for the maximum chunk size.

It mentions choosing a gear setting so that the speed is similar to normal operation or reducing the dosage by 25%.\n\nThe next ListItems involve driving along the field edge, maintaining a 2-meter distance from the center of the Schlepper. Opening the Dosiereinheit (probably a fertilizer spreader) some meters before passing over the first container. Stopping the spreading until at least one width (24 meters example) has been covered. If the dosage is less than 250 kg/ha, another pass is needed to collect enough artificial manure.\n\nOther TextItems mention using the same distances when opening and closing the Dosiereinheit, keeping speed and RPM constant. A ListItem about cleaning the containers with a Trichter (probably a funnel) into measurement tubes. It mentions that both sides have a hydraulic border spreading plate available. Then there are several ListItems about lowering the border spreading plate, turning off a valve to prevent it from moving upwards, closing Dosierung on the non-streut side, coupling the plate's drive on the non-streut side.\n\nNow, the question is about the \"tap\" material used for the hydraulic border spreading plate.

It mentions that when applying fertilizer or other materials at the edges of a field (Grenzstreuen), the driver needs to be careful with dosing because the bedienungssystem doesn't automatically adjust during this process. \n\nLooking at the section about Grenzstreuen, it says that you should first spread the middle of the field and then the borders. The system can't automatically calibrate during border spreading, so the dosage might not be accurate. To compensate for this, the user is advised to first spread the main part of the field so the system can set the correct dosage. Then, when doing the borders, they have to manually adjust.\n\nThere's a mention of two types of border spreading: Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen and Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen.

The context talks about how during border spreading, the dosage might deviate from what was set. It suggests that by first spreading the main field, the system can adjust correctly, ensuring accurate dosing even when doing borders.

There's a list of items, including \"Wartungsintervalle,\" which translates to maintenance intervals. Under this, there are various control and maintenance tasks listed with numbers from 0 to 23.\n\nLooking at the table_data, I see entries like \"t\u00e4 gl ic h:\" followed by numbers. The first row under t\u00e4 gl ic h: has numbers 0 through 23, each corresponding to a specific task. For example, number 1 is \"Kontrolle von Schrauben und Muttern,\" which means control of screws and nuts.\n\nHowever, I'm specifically looking for information about the operational hours before replacement of vanes. The term \"vanes\" in this context might refer to something like rotor blades or similar components that might wear out over time. \n\nI don't see any direct mention of \"vanes\" in the provided text. The tasks listed are about controlling and maintaining various parts, such as hydraulics, oils, and greasing. There's a mention of Schmieren (greasing) at positions 9, 10, and 12, but that's about applying grease, not the lifespan.\n\nSince there's no specific information provided about the operational hours for vanes, I have to conclude that the context doesn't contain the necessary data. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the operational hours before replacement of vanes. \n\n**Answer:** Not found in context.",

However, since the Abdeckplane is used to cover the hopper and protect it, it's reasonable to infer that the material should have good UV properties to prevent fading or degradation from sunlight.\n\nPutting this together, the Abdeckplane is the sail material used for the hopper cover, and it has good UV resistance.\n</think>\n\nThe sail material used for the hopper cover is **Abdeckplane**, which offers good UV resistance. \n\nAnswer: The hopper cover uses an Abdeckplane, which has good UV resistance.",
