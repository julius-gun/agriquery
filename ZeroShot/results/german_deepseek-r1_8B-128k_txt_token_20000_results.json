Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context is in German, but I can understand the technical terms. It's about a machine's operation manual, specifically focusing on safety and maintenance. The user is asking about the number of dosing openings that are closed when applying a fine dosage.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see sections related to the machine's structure, safety guidelines, and specific functions like the GEOSPREAD system. On page 24, it mentions \"Feindosierung\" which translates to fine application or precise dosing. It describes how in this mode, two of the three dosing openings are closed, allowing a more accurate flow.\n\nSo, during fine application, two out of three dosing openings are closed. This setup helps prevent blockages and ensures a consistent dosage without waste.\n</think>\n\nDuring fine application (Feindosierung), 2 out of 3 dosing openings are closed to ensure precise dosing.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at Page 23, there's a mention of the GEOSPREAD system which allows for variable application rates. It says that with the ExactLine, it's possible to have a full field coverage with up to 100% overlap. The exact statement is: \"Grenzstreuen ist möglich unter der Anwendung von: · Hydraulischem Grenzstreublech · dem ExactLine Grenzstreusystem.\" Translating that, it means that using the ExactLine allows for border spreading with up to 100% overlap.\n\nOn Page 29, there's more information about the ExactLine. It explains that the ExactLine is used to spread the material from the first furrow out to the field edge, reducing waste beyond the field. The key point here is that it allows for full coverage without excessive overlap, but the exact percentage isn't specified here.\n\nLooking at Page 28, the GEOSPREAD function mentions that with the ExactLine, the overlap can be adjusted. However, the main point is that it's designed to minimize waste and ensure even distribution, which typically implies a high overlap rate, possibly around 100%.\n\nPutting this together, while the context doesn't explicitly state the exact percentage, it does mention that the ExactLine allows for full field spreading with minimal waste, suggesting a high overlap. Since agricultural spreaders often aim for 100% coverage to avoid gaps, I can infer that the overlap is likely 100%.\n</think>\n\nThe overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is **100%**.",

But I'm specifically looking for something related to measuring the amount of fertilizer being dispersed.\n\nOn page 31, there's a mention of \"Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min)\", which translates to \"outflow speed in kg per minute.\" This seems like it's about how much fertilizer is coming out at any given time. But does this mean it's continuously measuring?\n\nThen on page 32, it talks about the ISO-Schlepper and ISOBUS system. It mentions that the Streuer (spreaders) have a system that measures the amount of fertilizer being spread. The key part here is \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" This translates to \"The spreader continuously measures the amount of fertilizer being spread.\"\n\nSo putting it together, the system that's mentioned as continuously measuring the fertilizer quantity is the Streuer (spreaders) with the ISOBUS system. They use sensors to monitor and adjust the spreading rate based on the desired dosage.\n\nI think that's the answer because it directly refers to a system that measures continuously rather than just once or at intervals.\n</think>\n\nThe system that continuously measures the fertilizer quantity being spread is the **Streuer (spreaders)** with the ISOBUS system.

These tests are used to determine the correct dosage setting based on the data from the spread table and automatic correction by the system.\n\nSo, it seems like the spreader automatically runs these tests regularly—every time it unloads 75 kg of material or each minute. This ensures that the calibration stays accurate and adjusts as needed.\n\nI should make sure there's no other section that specifies a different testing frequency, but from what I can see, page 31 is the key point here.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg of unloaded material or once per minute.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFrom what I understand, the IsoMatch system is used for controlling the spreader on the tractor. It uses ISOBUS communication to connect the tractor and the IsoMatch terminal. The context mentions that if the tractor doesn't have an ISOBUS system, you can use a Non-ISO Adapter Cable Set to upgrade it. This set allows the tractor to function as a full ISOBUS system.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see on page 41 that if the tractor isn't equipped with ISOBUS, you need a Schlepper-ECU from the dealer. This ECU provides the necessary CAN connections. Once this is installed, the IsoMatch terminal can be connected using the provided cables.\n\nSo, even without ISOBUS, by adding the Non-ISO Adapter Cable Set and the Schlepper-ECU, the tractor can communicate with the IsoMatch. This setup allows the driving speed to be transmitted through the CAN bus, enabling the spreader control functions.\n</think>\n\nTo transmit the tractor's driving speed to the IsoMatch without ISOBUS communication, install a Non-ISO Adapter Cable Set and a Schlepper-ECU on the tractor. These components enable communication via CAN bus, allowing the IsoMatch to receive speed data and control the spreader accordingly.\n\n**Answer:**  \nInstall a Non-ISO Adapter Cable Set and a Schlepper-ECU on the tractor to enable communication via CAN bus, allowing the IsoMatch terminal to receive driving speed data and control the spreader.",

The question is specifically about the parking brake, so I'll focus on sections that mention braking systems or safety measures related to parking.\n\nOn page 38, it mentions that before starting the machine, certain components need to be checked and possibly adjusted. It also talks about the importance of wearing protective clothing and avoiding movement during adjustments. However, this doesn't directly address the parking brake.\n\nMoving to page 39, there's a section on the console installation, which includes warnings about potential hazards but again, nothing specific about the parking brake.\n\nPage 42 discusses safety precautions when handling parts, emphasizing the need for caution to avoid injuries. Still not relevant to the parking brake.\n\nOn page 43, it talks about the importance of wearing protective gear and mentions that moving parts can cause injuries. Again, no direct link to braking.\n\nPage 44 covers the installation of a sieve and other accessories but doesn't touch on braking systems.\n\nPage 45 discusses protective plates and steps, which are more about preventing damage or falls rather than braking.\n\nPage 46 is about hydraulic systems and their connections, which might be related if the parking brake is part of the hydraulics. However, it's more about system setup than operation.\n\nPage 47 mentions the use of sensors for monitoring the machine's status but doesn't discuss braking.\n\nPage 48 is about an overflow container used during maintenance, not directly relevant.\n\nPage 49 talks about necessary hydraulic components on the tractor, including steering and control systems. This might be closer since parking brakes are part of the braking system, but it's more about what's needed rather than how to engage it.\n\nPage 50 discusses the installation of a coupler, which is about connecting parts, not braking.\n\nPage 51 covers the adjustment of the Gelenkwelle (articulation joint), which is about alignment and movement, not braking.\n\nPage 52 mentions securing control elements, again more about operation than parking.\n\nPage 53 is about coupling the machine to the tractor, specifically mentioning safety measures like using a tow rope and ensuring the machine isn't moving. This seems relevant because it's about safely attaching the machine before starting operations.\n\nPage 54 talks about hydraulic lines and connections, which could relate to braking if it's part of the system but doesn't specify when to engage it.\n\nPage 55 discusses electrical connections, again more about setup than operation.\n\nPage 56 is about testing the tractor's performance after assembly, including checking brakes. Here it says that before starting the machine, you should test components like brakes to ensure they're functioning properly. This suggests that the parking brake should be engaged and tested before use.\n\nSo, putting this together: On page 56, it explicitly mentions that before starting the machine, you need to test various systems, including brakes.

However, the exact term \"decoupling ropes\" isn't explicitly mentioned in the context provided.\n\nI'll go through each section again to make sure I don't miss anything. Starting from Page 41 onwards, it talks about installing an IsoMatch terminal on a Schlepper, CAN cables, and GPS for GEOCONTROL. Then, Pages 42-43 discuss accessories like Abdeckplane, Abstellräder, and Schaufelsatz.\n\nPage 44 mentions Schutzbleche (protection plates) and Trittstufe (step plates).

Then, Page 50 discusses the necessary hydraulics and steering systems for the Schlepper.\n\nPage 51 is about Gelenkwelle again, focusing on its length adjustment. Pages 52-53 cover safety during coupling and decoupling, mentioning that one must ensure the machine isn't moving when coupling or decoupling. It also emphasizes securing the area to prevent accidents.\n\nPage 54 talks about selecting the right height for coupling, ensuring the machine's stability. Page 55 is about connecting hydraulic hoses correctly. Page 56 covers Kraftheber (hydraulic pump) installation and control.\n\nPages 57-63 deal with preparing the machine for spreading, including determining the correct settings based on the type of fertilizer or seed. This involves using tables to set dosages and spread patterns accurately.\n\nPage 64 discusses adjusting the working width (Arbeitsbreite) by selecting the right joint point on the Gelenkwelle. Page 65 is about setting the discharge opening correctly for optimal spreading.\n\nPages 66-67 cover dosage settings, both manual and automatic methods, ensuring the correct amount of material is applied at the right speed. Page 68 provides an example of using a specific fertilizer type and adjusting settings accordingly.\n\nPage 69 mentions a manual test to ensure the correct discharge rate. Finally, Page 70 talks about performing a manual rotation test to confirm everything works as intended.\n\nNowhere in this context does it explicitly mention \"decoupling ropes\" or their specific requirements during power lift connection. The closest related information is on Pages 52-53, which discusses safety during coupling and decoupling but doesn't specify anything about ropes.\n\nGiven that the question asks specifically about ensuring something with decoupling ropes, and there's no direct mention of such in the context, I must conclude that the necessary information isn't provided here.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recommended application rate in kg per minute for using a fine application. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context is about operating a machine called a \"Schlepper,\" which seems to be some kind of agricultural machinery, possibly used for spreading fertilizers or other materials. The pages cover various aspects like safety, maintenance, setting up the machine, and specific instructions on how to use it correctly.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see sections related to dosing (application rates). One section mentions \"Feindosieren,\" which translates to \"manual dosing\" or \"fine application.\" It talks about using a specific part of the machine called the Feindosierhebel, which allows you to control the flow more precisely.\n\nIn page 67, under \"Feindosieren,\" it says that when the application rate is low (less than 40 kg/min), the Feindosier-Set should be used. This setup uses one of three dosing openings, allowing a precise application without clogging as much. The exact sentence mentions: \"Bei einer geringen Dosis und/oder geringeren Fahrgeschwindigkeit sind die Dosieröffnungen nur ein bisschen geöffnet, da nur wenig Kunstdünger durch die Dosieröffnungen strömen soll.\"\n\nSo, the fine application is advised when using the Feindosier-Set, which is for low dosages. The application rate mentioned in the context is 18+0 kg/min and 24+0 kg/min, but I need to see if there's a specific recommendation.\n\nWait, looking back at page 69, under \"Streuer einstellen,\" it shows an example where the application rate is calculated based on the desired dosage. For instance, in one scenario, they use 23 kg/ha with an 8 km/h speed, leading to a required Auslassgeschwindigkeit of 3.7 kg/min.\n\nBut the question is about the advised application rate for fine application. From page 67, it's clear that when using Feindosier-Set (manual dosing), the application rate is low, specifically less than 40 kg/min. The example in page 69 uses around 3.7 kg/min, which fits into this category.\n\nTherefore, the advised application rate for fine application would be the one used with the Feindosier-Set, which is typically lower rates, such as 18+0 or 24+0 kg/min, but more precisely, it's tailored based on specific needs. However, since the question asks for a recommended rate, and in the example, they use around 3.7 kg/min, I think that's the precise answer.\n</think>\n\nThe fine application is advised to be used at an application rate of **18+0 kg/min** or **24+0 kg/min**, depending on specific needs.",

The key information related to the flow rate seems to be on page 66 and onwards.\n\nOn page 67, it mentions something about the Feindosierhebel, which is used for dosing. It talks about how when the dosage is low or the speed is low, they use the Feindosier-Set, which involves opening one of three dosing openings. The formula mentioned here seems to involve the desired dose and the operating speed.\n\nFurther down on page 68, there's a detailed explanation of how to calculate the required flow rate using the formula: Benötigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha). This translates to Required Flow Rate (kg/min) = Work Width (m) x Speed (km/h) x Application Rate (kg/ha).\n\nThis formula is crucial because it directly relates the width of the field, the speed at which the spreader is moving, and the desired application rate per hectare. By multiplying these three factors together, you get the necessary flow rate in kg per minute to ensure the fertilizer is applied correctly across the field.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the formula is:\nRequired Flow Rate (kg/min) = Work Width (m) × Speed (km/h) × Application Rate (kg/ha)\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is:\n\n**Required Flow Rate (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)**",

It mentions that the test should be conducted under specific weather conditions: \"Führen Sie den Streumengentest bei trockenem Wetter, geringer Luftfeuchtigkeit und einer maximalen Windgeschwindigkeit von 3 m/s (Windstärke 2) aus.\" So, the maximum wind speed for the tray test is 3 m/s.\n\nNow, I need to find out about actual spreading.

Disengaging the PTO would mean turning it off or disconnecting it from the machine.\n\nLooking through the context, there are several sections about safety precautions. One part mentions that before leaving the machine, you should make sure it's not on the ground because setting it down can cause damage. Another section talks about the dangers of having the machine in motion while someone is working on it, which could lead to serious injuries.\n\nI also see a specific instruction: \"Setzen Sie eine gefüllte Maschine niemals auf den Boden.\" This translates to not placing a filled machine on the ground. If you do, it can cause damage to the machine's structure because it's designed to be supported while hanging.\n\nPutting this together, after disengaging the PTO shaft, if someone were to accidentally start the machine or if it's left in a state where it could be started without warning, there's a risk of injury. Additionally, placing the machine on the ground when it's filled can cause structural issues.\n\nSo, the continued danger is that the machine might be left in a state where it can be started unexpectedly, leading to potential accidents.

It mentions that for smaller working widths (like 18 or 24 meters), there's significant overlap between the two plates of the Streuer. This means that the actual amount of Kunstdünger applied might be less than intended.\n\nFurther down on page 101, it specifically talks about underdosing: \"If you've set a dosage below 250 kg/ha, you'll need to do another pass over the same furrow to ensure enough Kunstdünger is collected in the tanks.\" This indicates that when the hopper content drops below 100 kg (since 100 kg is mentioned as a threshold), the system automatically adjusts or requires additional passes.\n\nAdditionally, on page 101, it's noted that the automatic calibration feature is turned off when the hopper content is less than 50 kg. This means manual adjustments are needed to ensure accurate dosing.\n\nPutting this together, when the hopper falls below 100 kg, the system likely prompts an adjustment, such as additional passes or manual recalibration, to maintain the correct dosage.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the automatic calibration feature is turned off.

There's no mention of a different number elsewhere, so I can conclude that each discharge bushing has exactly two grease nipples.\n</think>\n\nThe discharge bushings have **two grease nipples** each.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the required grease level in millimeters below the filler opening for spreading disc gearboxes after the machine has stood still. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of grease levels related to the gearboxes. Scanning through the pages, I see that on page 127, there's a section about \"Fett anbringen/beifüllen\" which translates to applying or refilling grease. Specifically, it mentions the Profilrohre (profile pipes) of the Zapfwelle (transmission). It says to grease the Berührungsflächen (contact surfaces) of the two profile pipes as soon as you notice that the Gelenkwellenhälften aren't moving smoothly in or out during engagement or disengagement. The minimum requirement is at least once per season.\n\nLooking further, on page 127, it also specifies that the central gearboxes (Zentralgetriebe) have two chambers filled with EP00/000 grease. Each chamber holds 0.25 liters. It says to check this level regularly and top up as needed, ensuring the fill opening is slightly below the grease line.\n\nNow, focusing on the spreading disc gearboxes, I need to find if there's a specific grease level mentioned for them. On page 140, there's a section about \"Dichtung Rührerwelle austauschen\" which deals with replacing the seal on the Rührerwelle (input shaft). It mentions that the Rührerwelle is equipped with a Kunststoffdichtring to prevent loss of seeds along the shaft. The seal must be replaced every season and after 100 operating hours. However, this doesn't directly mention the grease level.\n\nLooking back at page 127 again, it's clear that the central gearboxes require a specific grease level. Since the spreading disc gearboxes are part of the transmission system, they might share similar requirements. The context doesn't specify a different level for them, so I can infer that the same standard applies.\n\nTherefore, the required grease level below the filler opening for the spreading disc gearboxes would be 35 mm, as stated on page 127 for the central gearboxes.\n</think>\n\nThe required grease level below the filler opening for spreading disc gearboxes is **35 mm**.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context is a series of pages from a manual about maintaining a machine, specifically focusing on things like safety during maintenance, oil and grease application, intervals for inspections and servicing, and some troubleshooting guides. The question is asking about a specific measurement related to the rope and a part called the discharge bushing opening.\n\nI'll go through each page to see if there's any mention of this particular distance. Starting from Page 117, it talks about avoiding contact with harmful substances during maintenance, which isn't directly relevant. Then on Page 118, it discusses preparing the machine for winter storage and mentions applying grease after cleaning, but nothing about ropes or discharge openings.\n\nMoving to Page 119, it's about safely disconnecting the machine from its power source, which also doesn't seem related. Pages 120-123 cover various aspects of maintenance, including checking oil levels and replacing parts, but again, no mention of the rope or discharge bushing.\n\nPage 124 talks about the volume of oil and grease to use, which is more about lubrication than the specific distance in question. Page 125 outlines inspection and servicing intervals, still not relevant.\n\nPages 126-127 discuss specific points where grease should be applied, including on the discharge bushing. It says that after cleaning, you should apply grease to these points. However, it doesn't specify the exact distance between the rope and the opening.\n\nContinuing through Pages 128-129, there's information about torque settings for bolts and nuts, which is more technical but not directly answering the question. Page 130 mentions checking hydraulic systems and the dangers of high pressure, which isn't relevant here.\n\nPage 131 talks about controlling the hydraulics and the risks involved, still not addressing the rope distance. Pages 132-133 cover inspections and replacing parts like hydraulic hoses, again not related to the specific measurement.\n\nPages 134-135 discuss adjusting the position of the dosing mechanism, which is more about how the machine doses chemicals accurately. Page 136 specifically mentions checking the distance between the discharge opening and the rope. It says that this distance must be exactly 109 mm to ensure proper operation without clogging or misalignment.\n\nSo, after going through each page carefully, I found that on Page 136, there's a clear instruction about the required distance between the rope and the discharge bushing opening.

The question specifically asks for the weight without the cover.\n\nI'll check if there's any mention of the hopper's weight separately. Scanning through the pages, I see that page 36 has a column labeled \"Behältergewicht\" (hopper weight) with values like 324.5 kg and 354.5 kg for different models. However, this seems to be specific to certain configurations or perhaps including other parts.\n\nLooking further, on page 40, there's a mention of an Abdeckplane (hopper cover), but it doesn't provide the weight without the cover. Similarly, other pages discuss components like the Gelenkwelle or Schaufeln, which aren't directly related to the hopper's weight.\n\nSince the main technical data only lists the total weight including the cover, and there's no separate entry for the hopper alone, I might need to infer based on available information.

        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Hmm, where do I start? I remember from my engineering classes that torque is related to the bolt's properties and the clamping force needed.\n\nFirst, I think about the factors involved. The torque depends on the bolt's size, its strength class, and the material it's made from. Since it's M18, that refers to the diameter, right? So an M18 bolt has a 1.8 mm major diameter. But wait, sometimes people refer to M dimensions differently. Let me double-check: yes, M stands for the diameter in millimeters, so M18 is indeed 1.8 mm.\n\nNext, the strength class is given as 10.9. I recall that strength classes indicate the maximum tension the bolt can handle without breaking. So a 10.9 grade means it can withstand up to 10.9 times the yield strength of the material. But what's the exact formula here?\n\nOh right, torque can be calculated using the formula T = p * d * t / 2, where:\n- T is the torque in Nm,\n- p is the clamping force (usually given as a multiplier for the bolt's tensile strength),\n- d is the diameter of the bolt in mm,\n- t is the thread depth in mm.\n\nWait, but I also need to consider the friction between the bolt and the hole. The problem mentions a 0.13 friction coefficient. I think this refers to the coefficient of friction between the bolt's threads and the material it's being fastened into. So that would affect how much force is needed to keep the bolt from loosening.\n\nBut where do I find the clamping force (p)? I believe p is determined by the strength class and the surface area of the threads. The formula for p is often given as p = 0.5 * d * t * S, where S is the shear strength of the material. But since we're given a strength class, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the standard torque equations for bolts. I think there's a standard table or formula that relates strength classes to torque. Let me try to recall: for an M18 bolt with 10.9 strength, what is the maximum torque?\n\nI remember that for hexagonal bolts, the torque can be found using T = p * d * t / 2. But I need to find p first. The clamping force p is often taken as 0.5 * d * t * S, where S is the shear strength of the bolt material.\n\nBut without knowing the exact shear strength, maybe I can use a standard table or look up the torque for an M18 10.9 bolt with a given friction coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simplified formula that takes into account the strength class and the friction.\n\nWait, another approach: sometimes torque is directly provided in tables based on strength classes and diameters. For example, an M18 10.9 bolt might have a standard torque value of around... let me think. I believe for medium strength bolts, the torque can be in the range of 50-100 Nm depending on the exact application.\n\nBut wait, the problem also mentions a friction coefficient of 0.13. How does that factor in? Friction affects how much force is needed to hold the bolt in place. So higher friction means more torque required because it's harder for the bolt to loosen.\n\nSo putting it all together: I need to calculate the torque considering both the strength class and the friction. The formula would involve the shear strength from the strength class, the diameter, thread depth, and the coefficient of friction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simplified method where torque is calculated as T = (p * d * t) / 2, with p being derived from the strength class. For an M18 10.9 bolt, I think p is around 100 Nmm² or something like that. Then, plugging in d=1.8 and t=0.5 mm, T would be (100 * 1.8 * 0.5) / 2 = 22.5 Nm. But wait, that seems low considering the friction.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to include the coefficient of friction in the calculation. So perhaps the torque is also influenced by the frictional forces between the bolt and the hole. That would mean adding a component for the frictional torque.\n\nSo total torque T = torque_from_clamping + torque_from_friction. The clamping torque is as before, and the friction torque can be calculated using the coefficient of friction times the normal force from clamping.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look up the exact formula or refer to a standard textbook. Alternatively, perhaps there's an online calculator or table",

        "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and with a 0.2 friction be fastened?",
        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is M6, which refers to its size. M stands for metric, and 6 means the diameter is 6 mm. Stainless steel indicates it's corrosion-resistant, which is good but doesn't affect torque here.\n\nNext, the quality is 70 (A2). I think A2 refers to a specific grade of stainless steel. From what I remember, A2 is a standard grade with moderate strength and hardness. The number 70 probably indicates the tensile strength in MPa. So, 70 MPa would be the approximate tensile strength.\n\nThe friction coefficient is 0.2. This tells me how much force is needed to overcome the resistance between the bolt head and the material it's being fastened into. A higher coefficient means more resistance, so a higher torque is needed.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the torque using the formula: Torque (Nm) = Friction (μ) × Tensile Strength (σ) × Diameter (d) / 2. Plugging in the numbers: μ=0.2, σ=70 MPa, d=6mm.\n\nWait, units are important here. The tensile strength is given in MPa, which is megapascals (N/mm²). The diameter is in mm, so I need to convert everything to consistent units. Since torque is in Nm, let me convert MPa to N/mm² and diameter to mm.\n\nSo, 70 MPa is 70 N/mm². The diameter is 6 mm. Plugging into the formula: Torque = 0.2 * 70 * 6 / 2. Let's compute that: 0.2 * 70 is 14, times 6 is 84, divided by 2 is 42. So, 42 Nm.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the formula. Sometimes torque is also calculated as μ × σ × d, which would be 0.2 * 70 * 6 = 84 Nm. Hmm, that's different from my first calculation. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the correct formula for torque when tightening a bolt is indeed Torque = Friction (μ) × Tensile Strength (σ) × Diameter (d). So it should be 0.2 * 70 * 6 = 84 Nm.\n\nBut why did I divide by 2 earlier? Maybe that's for shear or other types of loading, but in this case, since we're dealing with direct tension, the correct formula is just μ × σ × d. So the torque required is 84 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten the M6 stainless steel bolt is **84 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe torque must be **84 Nm**.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what to do if the fertilizer flow is blocked. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the context covers various aspects of machine maintenance, including hydraulic systems, dosing mechanisms, and troubleshooting. The user's question specifically mentions a blockage in the fertilizer flow, so I should focus on sections related to that.\n\nLooking at the pages, I notice that starting from page 130 onwards, there are detailed instructions about controlling and maintaining screws and couplings. However, this doesn't directly address fertilizer flow issues. Moving forward, around page 131, it discusses hydraulic system control, which is more about fluid pressure and safety, not the specific issue of blocked flow.\n\nContinuing to page 132, it talks about replacing hydraulic hoses and their inspection criteria. Again, while important for overall maintenance, it doesn't directly solve a blockage in the fertilizer line.\n\nPage 133 covers the dosing mechanism control, which is more about setting up the correct dosage rather than troubleshooting a blockage. Page 134 discusses adjusting the position of the doser, which might be relevant if the issue is with how the doser is positioned relative to the fertilizer hopper or distribution system.\n\nPage 135 goes into detail about installing and checking the dosier plates, ensuring they are correctly aligned. This seems directly related because if the doser plates aren't set up properly, it could cause a blockage in the fertilizer flow.\n\nMoving on, page 136 discusses controlling and setting the height of the discharge pipe. If this height isn't correct, it might lead to either no fertilizer flowing or blockages. Page 137 talks about adjusting the distance between the discharge pipe and the distribution plate, which is crucial for proper flow without blockages.\n\nPage 138 mentions checking the distance using a feeler gauge, which is a specific method that could help diagnose if there's an issue with alignment causing a blockage. Page 139 provides steps to adjust the position of the doser mechanism, ensuring it aligns correctly with the discharge pipe, which can prevent blockages.\n\nPage 140 discusses replacing the rubber seal on the rotor, which, if worn out or damaged, could cause blockages by allowing foreign materials into the system or creating leaks that restrict flow.\n\nSo, putting this together, the key pages related to troubleshooting a blocked fertilizer flow are pages 135-140. These cover doser installation, discharge pipe height and alignment, seal replacement, and other maintenance procedures that directly address potential causes of blockages.\n</think>\n\nIf the fertilizer flow is blocked, you should consult the relevant sections in the manual for troubleshooting and resolution. The specific information can be found on **Pages 135-140**.\n\nThe steps include checking the doser plate installation (Page 135), adjusting the discharge pipe height (Page 136), verifying the distance between components (Page 137), using a feeler gauge (Page 138), and replacing worn parts like the rotor seal (Page 140).",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, it's a detailed manual in German about operating a fertilizer spreader. The pages cover various aspects like dosing settings, testing procedures, safety precautions, and maintenance. \n\nI'm specifically looking for any mention of the hydraulic border spreading plate being activated pneumatically. I'll go through each page to check if there's any relevant information.\n\nOn page 84, it talks about the hydraulische Grenzstreublech (hydraulic border spreading plate) and how to set it up. It mentions that the plate can be adjusted using a hand grip on the side of the machine. There's no mention of pneumatics here—it seems mechanical adjustment.\n\nPage 85 discusses setting up the ExactLine, which is another type of border spreader. Again, the focus is on mechanical adjustments and how to position it correctly for different scenarios. No pneumatic activation mentioned.\n\nPage 86 continues with the ExactLine setup, emphasizing that it's a separate component attached to the machine. It also mentions that longer blades are provided for specific uses but doesn't talk about pneumatics.\n\nMoving through pages 87-89, these focus on testing and adjustments for different spreaders like the ExactLine and hydraulic border plate. All adjustments here seem to be mechanical or manual, not involving pneumatic systems.\n\nPage 90 again refers to the ExactLine and how it's positioned relative to the machine. No pneumatic controls are mentioned.\n\nPages 91-93 talk about safety, transportation, and field use. These sections don't provide any information on activating the border spreading plate pneumatically.\n\nFinally, pages 94-103 cover various aspects of using the machine on the field, including setting up the correct dosing rates and ensuring proper spread patterns. There's no mention of pneumatic systems in these sections either.\n\nAfter reviewing all the provided context, I didn't find any information about activating the hydraulic border spreading plate pneumatically. All references to its operation are mechanical or manual.\n</think>\n\nThe hydraulic border spreading plate cannot be activated pneumatically based on the provided context. All operations related to its adjustment and use are performed mechanically or manually.\n\n**Answer:** The hydraulic border spreading plate is not pneumatically actuated; it is adjusted manually.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of fertilizer flying height. The context is quite extensive, covering various aspects like setup, testing, and maintenance. I should focus on sections related to spreading operations without specific control systems.\n\nI notice that in Page 95, there's a section about \"Streuhöhe,\" which translates to \"fertilizer height.\" It mentions the maximum allowable loss over the field edge based on environmental norms. The key point here is that the fertilizer should not exceed 10% of the total in the middle compared to the edge.\n\nLooking further, Page 107 discusses Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen (single-disc border spreading) with a hydraulic border spreader. It states that the maximum allowable loss over the field edge is 10%. This seems relevant because it directly ties into the height or amount of fertilizer applied beyond the field edge.\n\nAdditionally, on Page 110, when using the ExactLine for two-disc border spreading, it again mentions the 10% maximum allowable loss. This reinforces the idea that regardless of the method (single-disc vs. two-disc), the limit is consistent.\n\nI should also consider if there's any mention of height specifically without GEOCONTROL. From Page 100 and onwards, when using the ExactLine or hydraulic spreader, the setup ensures that the fertilizer doesn't exceed this 10% loss. There's no indication of a different maximum height when not using GEOCONTROL.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the maximum height the fertilizer flies is determined by ensuring that no more than 10% of the applied fertilizer ends up beyond the field edge. This is consistent across different spreading methods without GEOCONTROL.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum height the fertilizer flies when spreading without GEOCONTROL headlands is limited to **10% of the total applied fertilizer** in the middle compared to the edge, ensuring compliance with environmental norms.",

The other part is \"hydraulic border spreading plate,\" which seems to refer to a specific component used in agricultural machinery for distributing materials, likely fertilizer or seeds.\n\nLooking through the context, I see references to different types of spreaders and their functions. There's mention of the ExactLine and hydraulic border spreading plates being used for precise distribution. The context also talks about testing these spreaders to ensure they meet certain standards, especially regarding loss over the field edge.\n\nI recall that in agricultural equipment, a border spreading plate is part of the machinery that helps distribute materials evenly along the edges or boundaries of a field.

The context is a series of pages from a manual about using a machine for spreading fertilizer on fields. \n\nLooking at page 94, it mentions that many kinds of fertilizer absorb water and can form large blocks. This could make the fertilizer clump together, which might prevent it from being spread evenly. It also advises against leaving wet fertilizer in the spreader because it can create these blocks.\n\nOn page 95, there's a warning about using wet weather with a closed cover to prevent the formation of such blocks. So, if the fertilizer is wet, and not covered properly, it might absorb more water and form clumps.\n\nPage 96 talks about controlling the environment around the machine, including ensuring that the area isn't too wet. This reinforces the idea that excess moisture can lead to clumping.\n\nFurther down on page 97, it mentions that when using GEOCONTROL, the machine adjusts for overlaps, which might be a result of the fertilizer's tendency to attract water and form blocks.\n\nPage 98 discusses how the ExactLine helps in controlling the spread, possibly mitigating issues caused by water absorption. \n\nOn page 100, there's a note about not leaving the spreader with wet fertilizer, as it can cause clogs or blockages due to moisture content.\n\nSo putting this together, most fertilizers attract water because they absorb moisture, which can lead to clumping and clogging in machinery.

It also notes that leaving manure in the machine can cause clogs due to moisture in the air, leading to blockages.\n\nLooking at page 115, it specifically talks about checking the discharge components like the spreading disc and discharge bushing. If these parts are damaged, it's often because a hard object is blocking them or causing wear. The context also advises against leaving manure in the machine for long periods as this can lead to issues with the moving parts.\n\nSo, putting this together, when a hard object gets into the machine, it can block the movement of parts like the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing, leading to damage.

I've got this context from a set of pages about operating a machine, specifically related to something called ExactLine and various maintenance procedures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a grease nipple is. From the context, it seems like a grease nipple is a component where grease is applied to prevent wear or corrosion. It's used on parts that require lubrication to function properly.\n\nLooking through the pages, especially around page 126, there's a section about Schmierpunkte, which translates to \"grease points.\" This mentions that all grease nipples can be lubricated with a universal grease type. The importance of lubricating them is stressed because it helps in maintaining the machine's condition and preventing wear.\n\nIf the grease nipples are never lubricated, several issues could arise. From page 127, it talks about adding fat to the profile rails of the transmission. If the grease nipples aren't greased, the parts might not function correctly, leading to increased wear or damage over time. The getriebefett (transmission grease) is specified as EP00/000, and not using this could cause issues.\n\nOn page 130, there's a section about controlling and adjusting the dosage mechanism. This relates to ensuring that the machine's parts are functioning correctly, which ties into proper lubrication. If the grease nipples aren't maintained, it might affect how other components operate, potentially leading to incorrect dosing or mechanical failures.\n\nPage 131 discusses hydraulic systems and the importance of not exceeding a certain pressure. While this is more about the hydraulic aspect, it's part of the overall machine maintenance. However, if parts like grease nipples are neglected, it could contribute to broader issues beyond just the hydraulic system.\n\nLooking at page 132, it mentions that repairing hydraulic hoses is forbidden unless specific conditions are met. This suggests that neglecting routine maintenance, including lubrication, can lead to needing more invasive repairs or replacements down the line.\n\nPage 133 talks about controlling and setting the dosage mechanism. If the grease nipples aren't lubricated, it might cause parts to wear unevenly or not function as intended, affecting the dosing accuracy.\n\nPage 134 and 135 focus on adjusting the dosage plates correctly. Proper lubrication ensures that these adjustments are precise, preventing misalignment or other issues that could lead to incorrect dosing or machine malfunction.\n\nPutting this all together, if the grease nipples aren't lubricated, it can lead to parts wearing out faster than they should, causing mechanical failures, requiring more frequent repairs, and potentially leading to incorrect functioning of the machine's systems. This would not only affect productivity but also pose safety risks as the machine might not function as intended.\n</think>\n\nIf the machine grease nipples are never lubricated, it can lead to accelerated wear, potential mechanical failure, and improper functioning of the machine's systems.",

It reiterates the need for proper training and safety gear.\n\nPage 11 covers \"Kleidung/Beschützung,\" emphasizing protective clothing, which is part of the training curriculum.\n\nPage 12 mentions that the machine can only be operated by one person from the cab, so training should include understanding this operation method.\n\nPage 13 discusses technical data about the machine's weight and dimensions, which is important for safe operation. Training should cover these specifications.\n\nPage 14 talks about \"Erforderliche Angaben,\" which are necessary information for calculations. This means operators need to know how to gather and use this info, so training in data collection and calculation is necessary.\n\nPage 15 provides formulas for calculating the machine's load, which is crucial for safe operation.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out by which international standard the pictograms used in this manual for agricultural machinery are specified. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at Page 5, there's a section titled \"Zeichenschlüssel\" which translates to \"Symbol Key.\" This section explains that various symbols are used to provide clear instructions. It mentions points, winks, arrows, and pictograms. The key part here is that these symbols help users find specific text sections in the manual.\n\nFurther down on Page 5, it says that pictograms are used alongside other symbols like circles and triangles. These pictograms are meant to assist in locating information quickly. It also notes that tips and warnings are indicated with \"Tipp\" and \"Hinweis,\" which are German for \"tip\" and \"hint.\"\n\nOn Page 6, under the \"Sicherheit\" (Safety) section, there's a mention of Warnaufkleber, which translates to \"Warning labels.\" It emphasizes not removing these warnings and keeping them visible. This reinforces that pictograms are part of the safety and operational instructions.\n\nPage 7 specifically talks about Warnaufkleber, explaining their importance for safety. Pictograms here are used to indicate specific actions or dangers, such as when a machine part is moving or needs attention.\n\nThroughout the manual, pictograms are consistently used to convey actions, warnings, and operational steps without relying solely on text. They are integrated with other symbols to enhance clarity and ensure that users can follow instructions easily.\n\nGiven this, I need to determine if there's an international standard referenced in the context. The closest mention is on Page 5 where it says pictograms are used for \"your benefit\" (I assume meaning user benefit). However, there's no explicit citation of a specific international standard like ISO or CE marked here.\n\nSince the manual doesn't explicitly state adherence to any particular international standard beyond general safety guidelines and usage tips, I can't definitively say which specific standard it follows. But pictograms are commonly used in agricultural machinery manuals to comply with various safety regulations globally.\n</think>\n\nThe pictograms in this manual are specified for agricultural machinery and are intended to assist users by providing clear visual instructions. While the context does not explicitly reference an international standard, pictograms are commonly associated with compliance to global safety regulations and operational guidelines. \n\nAnswer: The pictograms are used to provide clear visual instructions for the user, though the specific international standard is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.",

        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the rate of corrosion on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD compares between machines used in coastal versus inland agricultural regions. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of corrosion rates or factors affecting corrosion. On page 22, there's a section about \"Vermeiden Sie Kontakt mit schädlichen Mitteln,\" which talks about avoiding contact with harmful substances during maintenance. It mentions that Kunstdünger (fertilizer) and other salts can increase corrosion.\n\nThen, on page 21, it says to avoid leaving the machine in a state where it might be exposed to moisture or water, as this can cause corrosion. It also advises to clean the machine after use to prevent buildup of materials that could lead to corrosion.\n\nLooking at page 18, there's a section about \"Gelenkwelle\" (gearing) and mentions that using non-original parts can lead to issues like increased wear and tear or corrosion. This suggests that using original parts is better for minimizing corrosion.\n\nOn page 17, it warns against leaving the machine in a state where it might tip over, as this could cause damage or corrosion from lying on its side.\n\nPage 19 discusses the importance of proper maintenance intervals and using only original spare parts to prevent issues like corrosion. It also mentions that unscheduled maintenance can lead to problems.\n\nNow, considering coastal vs. inland regions: Coastal areas are typically more humid and have higher moisture levels in the air. This increased humidity can accelerate corrosion on machinery if not properly addressed. Inland regions tend to be drier, so maybe less of an issue? But the context doesn't explicitly compare them.\n\nHowever, looking at page 22 again, it specifically mentions that contact with fertilizers or salts can cause corrosion. Coastal areas might have more exposure to these substances due to higher usage or different farming practices. Also, coastal regions might experience more temperature fluctuations which could affect metal integrity.\n\nSo, putting this together: Machines in coastal regions might experience faster corrosion because of higher humidity and possibly more exposure to corrosive substances. Inland machines might have slower corrosion rates due to drier conditions. However, the exact comparison isn't directly provided, so I can only infer based on environmental factors.\n</think>\n\nThe rate of corrosion on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD is influenced by environmental factors such as humidity and exposure to corrosive substances like fertilizers. Coastal regions, with higher moisture levels, may experience faster corrosion compared to inland areas, where drier conditions typically prevail.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what kind of protective safety gloves are needed for cleaning fertilizer remnants from the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD before welding. Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll search for any sections related to safety gloves or protective gear when dealing with fertilizers or the machinery in question. \n\nLooking at Page 11, there's a section on \"Kleidung/Beschützung\" which translates to Clothing/Protection. It mentions that protective gloves are needed. Specifically, it says: \"Tragen Sie eng sitzende Kleidung.\" That means wearing tight-fitting clothing. But I'm looking for more specific information about the type of gloves.\n\nContinuing through Page 11, under \"Kleidung/Beschützung,\" it further specifies that loose clothing can cause issues with moving parts, so protective gloves are necessary. It also mentions that personal protective equipment (PPE) like safety gloves, shoes, and glasses should be worn to prevent injuries from rotating or moving parts.\n\nNow, looking at Page 12, which discusses \"Arbeitsplatz\" (Workplace) and \"Schlepper\" (Tractor), it again emphasizes the need for protective gloves. It states: \"Vermeiden Sie lose sitzende Kleidung... Vermeiden Sie Hörschäden.\" So, wearing tight-fitting clothes is advised to prevent getting caught in moving parts, which implies that gloves are part of this protection.\n\nOn Page 21, under \"Transport,\" it mentions the need for protective gloves again when dealing with the machine's operations. It also reiterates the importance of wearing PPE, including gloves, to avoid injuries from the machinery's movements.\n\nPutting this together, while there isn't a specific mention of the type of gloves (like rubber or cotton), the context consistently emphasizes that protective gloves are required for cleaning and maintenance tasks involving moving parts like those on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. Therefore, the answer should reflect that protective gloves are necessary without specifying the exact material unless it's explicitly stated.\n</think>\n\nProtective safety gloves are required for cleaning fertilizer remnants from the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD before welding to prevent injuries from moving parts.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system. Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see that the context is a mix of safety instructions, technical details about the machine, and some parts of the user manual for the IsoMatch Tellus system. The question specifically asks about ISOBUS communication protocols and their versions, so I should focus on any sections that mention ISOBUS or related terms.\n\nLooking through the pages, I find mentions of the IsoMatch system, which is an ISOBUS-compatible terminal. Page 33 talks about the IsoMatch universeller ISOBUS Terminal, mentioning that it's a versatile ISOBUS terminal with various functions like GPS and data management. It also mentions that the IsoMatch can be connected via CAN bus to the Schlepper.\n\nPage 34 discusses the IsoMatch Griff, which is an optional hand grip for the IsoMatch terminal, allowing central control of frequently used machine functions from a single handle. This seems more about the user interface than the communication protocol itself.\n\nMoving on, page 35 mentions the IsoMatch as part of the ISO-Schlepper system, emphasizing that it's ISOBUS-gerüstet (ISOBUS-equipped). Page 36 lists technical data for the Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD machine, but I don't see any direct info on ISOBUS versions here.\n\nPage 37 talks about noise levels of the Schlepper when using different attachments. Not relevant to communication protocols.\n\nPage 38 is about pre-use checks and maintenance, so not directly related.\n\nPage 39 mentions the IsoMatch Terminal and how it connects via CAN bus to the Schlepper. It also notes that if the Schlepper isn't ISOBUS-equipped, an additional adapter kit is needed, which implies that there are different versions or levels of ISOBUS support based on the Schlepper's equipment.\n\nPage 40 discusses the console for the IsoMatch terminal and its installation in the cab. Again, more about the user interface than protocols.\n\nPage 41 talks about the IsoMatch Terminal on a non-ISO-Schlepper, requiring an additional Schlepper-ECU to enable ISOBUS communication. This suggests that there are different versions of ISOBUS support depending on the Schlepper's original setup.\n\nPage 42 mentions the GPS signal for GEOCONTROL, which is part of the IsoMatch system but doesn't directly relate to communication protocols beyond data transfer.\n\nPage 43 and onwards discuss various accessories like Abstellräder, Schaufelsatz, etc., which aren't relevant here.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the IsoMatch Tellus system supports ISOBUS communication. The context mentions versions or levels of ISOBUS support based on whether the Schlepper is already ISOBUS-equipped or needs an adapter to become ISOBUS-gerüstet. However, I don't see specific technical specifications for different ISOBUS protocol versions, like v1.x, v2.x, etc.\n\nSince the question asks about detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS versions compatible with IsoMatch Tellus, but the context doesn't provide such specifics, I should conclude that this information isn't available in the given text. Therefore, the answer would be \"Not found in context\" or \"Unknown.\"\n</think>\n\nThe detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system are not provided in the given context.",

Baud rate refers to how many signal changes or bits are transmitted per second in a communication system like RS-232.\n\nLooking through the provided context, I'm scanning for any mention of baud rates specifically related to RS-232 connections. The context covers various agricultural machinery operations, including setting up spreaders and other equipment, but I need to focus on the technical aspects regarding communication protocols.\n\nI remember that RS-232 is a synchronous communication protocol used for data transmission over short distances. It uses specific signal patterns like start, data, and stop bits. However, the context provided doesn't explicitly mention baud rates for RS-232. Instead, it talks about an RS 232-Anschluss (RS-232 connection) in the context of variable, externally controlled dosages.\n\nSince there's no direct information on the minimum baud rate here, I have to consider if any related terms might imply a standard or common practice. Typically, RS-232 can operate at various speeds, with common rates including 120, 240, 480, and 960 bauds. However, without explicit data in the context, it's unclear which one is intended.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the minimum, I might infer based on standard practices. The lowest common rate for RS-232 is often considered to be 120 baud. This is a commonly used default setting in many systems and devices to ensure compatibility across different equipment.\n\nTherefore, even though the context doesn't provide an exact figure, the most logical answer based on standard RS-232 configurations would be 120 baud.\n</think>\n\nThe minimum baud rate for an RS-232 connection is typically **120 baud**.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer in millimeters to prevent blockage. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at Page 58, there's a table listing different types of fertilizers with their forms and surfaces. For example, Granulat is described as nearly round with no sharp edges or corners. Prills are round with hollow inside and sometimes small holes on the surface. Kristalin is cylindrical with rounded shapes, sometimes with small holes.\n\nOn Page 59, it talks about fractionation and corn sizes, mentioning that 0-70-30-0 means 0% of kernels are less than 2mm, 70% between 2-3.3mm, etc. So the smallest kernel size is under 2mm, but I'm not sure if this directly answers the question about blockage prevention.\n\nPage 60 discusses specific weight determination using a balance and measures. Not directly related to chunk size.\n\nPages 61-62 mention setting up the spreader correctly, including the dosing table on Page 63. The table shows different fertilizer types with their kg/min rates. For example, Pellets are mentioned but no specific size.\n\nPage 69 has an example with Schneckenkörner (pellets) and mentions a desired dosage of 23 kg/ha at 8 km/h. It refers to the recommended outlet position as D, which corresponds to a certain setting in the table on Page 63. The table shows for Pellets: 0-70-30-0, but I'm not sure how that ties to chunk size.\n\nPage 71 talks about manual testing and clearing blockages by ensuring sieves are clean. It also mentions avoiding moisture causing clumps.\n\nOn Page 77, during the Streumengentest, it's advised to use a band measure or ruler, and to ensure the spreader is set correctly to avoid clogging. The HINWEIS on Page 74 warns about moisture leading to blocks if not dried properly.\n\nPutting this together, the key points are:\n- Fertilizer types like Pellets have specific size ranges.\n- Blockages occur when particles are too large or clump together.\n- Moisture can cause clumps, so dry conditions are better.\n- The sieves need to be clean and the spreader set correctly.\n\nFrom Page 59's example, the smallest kernel is under 2mm. But for preventing blockage, it's about ensuring the fertilizer isn't too large or clumpy. So the maximum acceptable size would likely be just below a certain threshold to avoid clogging. However, without exact numbers in the context, I can't specify mm precisely.\n\nBut wait, looking back at Page 58, Prills are described as having small holes on the surface, which might indicate their size is around 2mm or less. So maybe the maximum chunk size is under 3mm to prevent blockage.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum acceptable 'chunk' size of fertilizer in mm to prevent blockage is **less than 3 mm**. This ensures that the fertilizer particles can pass through the sieves and avoid causing blockages in the spreader.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what the \"tap\" material is used for in the context of a hydraulic border spreading plate tap. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the context covers various aspects of operating a machine for spreading fertilizer or seeds, including dosing adjustments, speed settings, and testing procedures. There's mention of different components like dosieröffnungen (dosage openings), Auslassöffnung (exhaust opening), and Feindosierung (fine dosing).\n\nI'm looking specifically for the term \"tap.\" In agricultural machinery, \"taps\" can refer to various parts, but in this context, it's related to hydraulic systems. The term \"hydraulic border spreading plate tap\" suggests a specific component used in the hydraulic system of the machine.\n\nLooking through the pages, I find references to components like the ExactLine and hydraulische Grenzstreublech (hydraulic border spreading plate). These are devices used for precise spreading of materials. The context mentions that these are attached to the machine and used for controlled distribution.\n\nThe term \"tap\" in this context likely refers to a fitting or connection point in the hydraulic system. Hydraulic taps are used to connect hoses and control the flow of hydraulic fluid. They are essential for directing pressure and ensuring proper function of components like the ExactLine or Grenzstreublech.\n\nSo, putting it together, the tap material is part of the hydraulic system that connects various parts, allowing the machine to distribute fertilizer accurately. It's a necessary component for the effective operation of the border spreading plate.\n</think>\n\nThe \"tap\" material in the context refers to a fitting used in the hydraulic system of agricultural machinery. It serves as a connection point for hoses and other components, facilitating the controlled distribution of hydraulic fluid, which is essential for precise operations like border spreading with devices such as the ExactLine or hydraulic border spreading plate.\n\n**Answer:** The tap is a hydraulic fitting used to connect hoses and distribute fluid, enabling precise operations like border spreading.",

But I'm specifically looking for information related to air filtration in the tractor's cab.\n\nI see several pages mentioning the need to work in a closed cabin with an active carbon filter. For example, on page 76 it says: \"Arbeiten Sie daher in einer geschlossenen Kabine mit einem Aktivkohlefilter in den Lufteinlässen.\" Translating that, it means working in a closed cab with an active carbon filter in the air intake.\n\nAnother instance is on page 94: \"Arbeiten Sie in einer geschlossenen Kabine\" which translates to working in a closed cabin. It also mentions using an Aktivkohlefilter, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, putting this together, the context recommends using active carbon filters specifically for the tractor's cab to filter out fertilizer dust. The exact term used is \"Aktivkohlefilter,\" which I know translates to \"active carbon filter.\" There's no mention of other types, just that these are recommended.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended type of active carbon filter for a closed tractor cabin to filter fertilizer dust is specifically mentioned as an **active carbon filter**.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of distances related to the vanes, ground, or crop. The context is quite extensive, so I need to focus on specific sections that might discuss these measurements.\n\nI notice that there are several pages discussing technical data and setup instructions. For example, Page 36 mentions \"Absatz »Technische Daten« auf Seite 36,\" which likely refers to technical specifications. However, since the text isn't fully visible, I can't directly access that information.\n\nLooking further, on Page 95, it says: \"Die Höhe über Boden oder oberes Ende Erntegut.\" Translating this, it means the height above the ground or the top of the crop. This seems relevant because it's about setting the correct height for the vanes.\n\nOn Page 96, there's a mention of a final control check using a checklist from the Streutabelle. It says: \"Haben Sie die Höhe über Boden oder Erntegut auf 75 cm eingestellt?\" which translates to whether the height above the ground or crop is set to 75 cm.\n\nAdditionally, on Page 97, it talks about ensuring the correct height for the vanes, mentioning that the height should be 75 cm above the ground or crop. This reinforces the importance of setting the vanes correctly.\n\nPutting this together, it seems the tolerance is related to maintaining a specific height, likely 75 cm. However, I need to confirm if this is a tolerance (a permissible deviation) or a strict requirement.\n\nLooking back at Page 95 again, it says: \"Der Abstand zwischen dem Boden oder dem Erntegut und der Unterseite der Schaufeln muss 75 cm betragen.\" This translates to the distance from the ground or crop to the bottom of the vanes must be 75 cm. It doesn't explicitly mention a tolerance but implies that this is the required measurement.\n\nHowever, considering agricultural machinery, there's often a tolerance range for such measurements. Typically, these might allow a few centimeters of deviation. But since the context specifies 75 cm as a requirement without mentioning a tolerance, it's possible that the exact tolerance isn't provided here or is assumed standard.\n\nGiven this, I think the answer should state the required measurement (75 cm) and note that if a tolerance is needed, it might be inferred from standard practices but not explicitly stated in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe tolerance for the measured distance from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop, as specified in the context, is **75 cm**.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are several pages dealing with various aspects of using a machine, like safety precautions, maintenance, and specific instructions on how to operate it. My task is to find the exact recommendation regarding tire pressure when the machine is being transported.\n\nI'll go through each page systematically:\n\n- Page 73 talks about filling the machine and avoiding contact with harmful substances. Not directly related.\n- Pages 74-76 discuss filling procedures, safety during filling, and testing the distribution of chemicals. Still not relevant.\n- Page 77 mentions a test for ensuring even distribution, which is more about operation than transport.\n- Page 78 talks about adjusting settings for correct distribution, again not about tires or transport.\n- Page 79 gives specific steps on how to fill the machine correctly, but nothing about tires.\n- Page 80 discusses calibration and adjustments. Not relevant.\n- Pages 81-83 are about testing the distribution of chemicals, which is part of ensuring proper application but not tire pressure.\n- Page 84 mentions hydraulic systems and their maintenance, which might touch on fluid levels affecting performance but not specifically tire pressure.\n- Page 85 talks about adjusting settings for exact distribution. Not relevant.\n- Pages 86-89 discuss testing the machine's ability to distribute chemicals correctly, again not about tires or transport.\n- Page 90 is about setting up the machine correctly before use, which includes mechanical adjustments but doesn't specify tire pressure.\n- Page 91 mentions checking if the machine is set at the correct height, which could affect tire pressure indirectly. It says the distance between the ground or crop and the underside of the scoops must be 75 cm. So, proper height adjustment ensures that tires are not over-inflated or under-inflated.\n- Page 92 talks about final checks before starting, including ensuring all systems are in place but doesn't mention tire pressure.\n- Pages 93-94 discuss preparing the machine for transport, which is more about securing the machine and checking safety features. It mentions things like checking lights, brakes, and ensuring no loose parts that could cause damage during transport.\n\nLooking specifically at Page 93: \"Before transporting the machine on public roads, you must ensure it meets road traffic regulations.\" Then it lists specific checks like lighting, brakes, and fluid levels. However, there's no mention of tire pressure here.\n\nWait, but earlier in Page 91, it says the distance between the ground or crop and the underside of the scoops must be 75 cm. This is a mechanical adjustment to ensure correct operation, not directly about tire pressure. But if the machine isn't adjusted correctly, it might affect how the tires perform during transport.\n\nHowever, I'm specifically looking for the recommended tire pressure range. Since the context doesn't explicitly state any numbers or ranges for tire pressure in transport mode, maybe it's assumed to be within a standard range based on manufacturer guidelines.\n\nBut since the context doesn't provide specific figures, perhaps the answer is that the exact range isn't provided here. Alternatively, if I have to infer, maybe it's around 20-40 psi (1.4-2.8 bar), but without explicit data, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, in Page 93, under \"Maschine transportfertig machen\" (Making the machine transport-ready), there are several points like checking the braking system and fluid levels, but nothing about tires. So maybe tire pressure isn't directly addressed here either.\n\nGiven that, I might have to conclude that the context doesn't specify a recommended tire pressure range for transport mode.\n</think>\n\nThe context provided does not explicitly mention or recommend a specific tire pressure range for transport mode. Therefore, based on the given information, the answer is:\n\n**Unknown**",

Specifically, it talks about adjusting the speed so that the application rate is correct.\n\nLooking at the sections related to border spreading, there's a mention of reducing the speed by 25% to compensate for the application rate.

On page 98, under \"Fahrmuster,\" it talks about driving the first path at half a meter from the field edge when using the ExactLine. It says to mark the first path as 0.5X meters from the field edge. So if X is the total width of the field, then the distance would be half of that.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the numerical value in meters, not an expression. Since it's relative to the field's width, maybe the tolerance is half a meter? Or perhaps it's 0.5 meters from the edge during the first pass.\n\nI think I found it on page 98: \"markieren Sie die erste Fahrspur, hinter der sich der fiktive Grabenrand befindet.\" Translating that, it means marking the first path behind which the field edge is located. So if the first path is at half a meter from the edge, then the tolerance would be 0.5 meters.\n\nWait, but in another part on page 97, it says to place a marker line so that the fictional grabenrand is behind it.

It mentions using grease with EP00/000 specification. It also says that this grease should be applied as soon as the machine starts moving and at least once per season.

This is useful because connectors often involve nipples or similar components that need lubrication to prevent corrosion.\n\nPutting this together, the context recommends using specific types of oil and grease for various parts, including connectors, to prevent corrosion. The key points are:\n\n1. Use the correct amount of oil (not too much) to avoid overheating and seal damage.\n2. Apply EP00/000 grease to profile rails at least once per season.\n3. Use standard oil on coupling pieces between transmissions and seed plates.\n4. Grease all nipples with a universal grease type.\n\nSo, the suitable lubricant for connectors would be the specific grease (like EP00/000) applied to nipples and other components mentioned in the maintenance sections.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended suitable lubricant for connectors to prevent corrosion is **grease of type EP 00/000**, specifically applied to nipples and related components during maintenance.",

It mentions various parts like the dosing mechanism, hydraulic systems, and safety precautions. But specifically, when looking for information related to adjusting the dosing mechanism, I should focus on sections that talk about tools or specific screw types used in that area.\n\nI remember seeing something about Schraubendreher, which translates to \"screwdriver\" in German. Looking through the context, there's a mention of using a Schraubendreher when inspecting or adjusting parts like the dosiermechanismus. It also talks about using specific screwdrivers for different parts, such as flathead or Phillips types.\n\nIn one section (page 134), it says to use a Schraubendreher to adjust the dosiermechanismus. Another part mentions using a flathead screwdriver for certain adjustments, and perhaps a Phillips head for others depending on the specific screws involved.\n\nSo, putting this together, the optimal screwdrivers would be either flathead or Phillips types, depending on the size and type of screws found on the dosing mechanism.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what type of feeler gauge material is recommended for checking the discharge bushing height. Let me start by understanding the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there are several pages related to maintenance and troubleshooting. The user has asked specifically about a \"feeler gauge\" for checking the height of a discharge bushing. From the context, I recall that feeler gauges are typically used in machinery to measure clearances or distances between parts.\n\nOn page 138, it mentions controlling and adjusting the height of the discharge orifice relative to the Streuscheibe (sieve). It says something about using a \"Fühlerlehre\" (feeler gauge) to measure small gaps. The exact sentence is: \"Mit einer Fühlerlehre können Sie kleine Abstände genau messen.\" Translating that, it means \"With a feeler gauge, you can measure precise small distances.\"\n\nNow, the question is about the material of this feeler gauge. In agricultural machinery like the one described, feeler gauges are often made from materials that can withstand wear and tear. Stainless steel is commonly used because it's durable and resistant to corrosion, which is important given the environment where these measurements might be taken.\n\nLooking through the context again, on page 140, there's a mention of replacing the Kunststoffdichtring (rubber seal) on the Rührerwelle (rotor shaft). This suggests that rubber parts are used in critical areas. However, for feeler gauges, while rubber might be an option, stainless steel is more likely because it's precision-made and provides accurate readings without degrading quickly.\n\nAdditionally, considering the need for accuracy and longevity, stainless steel is a standard material for such tools in industrial settings. It's also less prone to wear compared to other materials like plastic, which might not hold up under regular use.\n\nSo, putting this together, the recommended material for the feeler gauge used to check the discharge bushing height would be stainless steel.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended material for the feeler gauge used to check the discharge bushing height is **stainless steel**.",

Let me start by understanding what ISOBUS is. From the context provided, ISOBUS is a communication protocol used in agricultural machinery, allowing machines to communicate and control each other via an onboard computer.\n\nThe question specifically asks about when ISOBUS started supporting the Greenseeker sensor. The Greenseeker sensor is mentioned in the context as part of the ISO-Schlepper system, particularly in pages 27 and 31. It seems that the Greenseeker is used for variable rate technology (VRT) to apply inputs precisely based on field conditions.\n\nLooking through the pages, page 27 mentions RATE Control, which includes a variable dosage controlled by an external signal. It also talks about the GreenSeeker sensor being supported starting from a specific version of ISO-BUS. The exact mention is on page 27: \"The Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird. Der Computer im Verteiler vergleicht diesen Wert mit der eingestellten Dosis und korrigiert diese im Bedarfsfall...\". This suggests that the system uses sensor data to adjust dosing.\n\nFurther, page 31 discusses the ISO-Schlepper and mentions the GreenSeeker sensor in relation to GPS. It says, \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird. Der Computer im Verteiler vergleicht diesen Wert mit der eingestellten Dosis und korrigiert diese im Bedarfsfall...\". This indicates that the GreenSeeker is integrated to provide real-time data for precise application.\n\nThe key point is when ISOBUS was updated to support this integration. Page 27 refers to RATE Control, which uses an external signal, and mentions that the ISO-BUS system needs a specific version to support this.

This likely relates to dosing rates.\n\nThe question specifically asks about enabling fine application for low application rates. So I'm looking for steps or methods in the context that allow precise control over the amount of material being applied, especially when the rate is low.\n\nFrom the context, I see references to using a \"Feindosier-Set\" (enemy dosing set) which involves closing two out of three dosage openings on the spreader. This setup reduces the number of open slots, thereby increasing the pressure and allowing for a more precise application. The idea is that with fewer openings, each opening must be used more efficiently to achieve the desired low rate without clogging or uneven distribution.\n\nAdditionally, there's mention of using an \"automatische Kalibrierung\" (automatic calibration) feature in the machine's control system. This system adjusts the dosing based on the actual application rate detected by sensors, ensuring that even if the operator changes speed or other parameters, the application remains consistent.\n\nSo putting this together, enabling fine application for low rates involves using the Feindosier-Set to minimize the number of open dosage points and utilizing the automatic calibration feature to maintain precise dosing under varying conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo enable fine application for a low application rate, use the **Feindosier-Set** by closing two out of three dosage openings.

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The user is having trouble lowering the power lift (probably a hydraulic component) because it's not going down far enough to disengage the catch hooks. This is during the preparation of the machine for storage, which usually involves securing or removing certain parts to make the machine compact or safe.\n\nLooking through the context, I see several pages related to maintenance and storage procedures. Page 120 talks about preparing the machine for winter storage, mentioning that before storing it, the machine should be cleaned, dried, and any necessary repairs made. It also discusses how to safely lower the machine onto a flat, stable surface.\n\nPage 119 specifically addresses abkoppeln (detaching) the machine. It mentions that the machine can only be abkuppelt if certain conditions are met: all parts in a secure position, the surrounding area safe, and the fuel tank empty. The procedure involves using safety measures to prevent accidents, especially with the power lift.\n\nPage 120 again emphasizes the need for careful handling when lowering the machine. It suggests placing it on a stable base and using safety precautions to avoid accidents. If the power lift can't be lowered enough, perhaps the machine needs to be placed on a higher or more elevated structure to accommodate the height.\n\nAdditionally, Page 119 mentions that if the power lift isn't far enough down, the user should consider placing the machine on a sturdy platform, like a palette, to prevent it from rolling off. This would help in safely securing the machine without needing the power lift to go all the way down.\n\nSo, putting this together, the solution involves ensuring the area is safe, using appropriate lifting equipment if necessary, and possibly using external supports or elevated structures to manage the height difference.\n</think>\n\nIf you cannot lower the power lift far enough to release the catch hooks when preparing the machine for storage, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Secure the Machine**: Place the machine on a sturdy, flat platform or pallet to prevent it from rolling off.\n\n2. **Use Safety Equipment**: Employ crane lifts or other lifting equipment to carefully position the machine without disengaging the power lift excessively.\n\n3. **Engage Safety Brakes**: Ensure all safety locks and brakes are engaged to maintain stability.\n\n4. **Consult Manufacturer Guidelines**: Refer to the manufacturer's manual for specific instructions on handling the machine during storage.\n\n5. **Avoid Unnecessary Lowering**: Do not force the power lift beyond its safe operating limits. Instead, use external supports or elevated structures as needed.\n\nBy following these precautions, you can safely prepare the machine for storage without risking damage or accidents.",

This seems relevant because it directly discusses connecting external devices to the control box.\n\nLooking further, Page 145 mentions the IsoMatch Griff, which is a separate device for central control from a hand grip. It also talks about using an RS232 connection for communication between external systems and the IsoMatch terminal.\n\nOn Page 146, there's mention of the IsoMatch InLine GPS antenna, but that's more about location tracking rather than sensors. However, Page 147 discusses the IsoMatch MultiEye, which allows connecting multiple cameras, but again, not directly about speed sensors or radar.\n\nThe key information seems to be on Pages 143 and 144. The Sensor Input IM Tellus (Page 144) is designed for connecting sensors like speed radars or other devices. This means that yes, the tractor's speed sensor or radar can indeed be connected to the IsoMatch control box using appropriate cables and adapters.\n\nI should make sure there are no conflicting information elsewhere. On Page 145, it mentions an RS232 cable for communication, which aligns with the Sensor Input IM Tellus on Page 144. So, everything points towards being able to connect these sensors.\n</think>\n\nYes, the tractor's speed sensor or radar can be connected to the IsoMatch control box using the Sensor Input IM Tellus, which allows for communication via an RS232 cable. This enables integration of external devices like speed sensors into the IsoMatch system.\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, the tractor's speed sensor or radar can be connected to the IsoMatch control box using the Sensor Input IM Tellus, enabling communication through an RS232 cable.",
