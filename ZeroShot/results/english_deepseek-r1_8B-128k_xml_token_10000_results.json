Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 68, there's a section about \"Dosing setting\" which includes some calculations. It mentions using a formula to calculate the flowrate when the application rate isn't directly provided in the spreading chart. The formula is given as:\n\nflowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. It says to multiply working width by driving speed and application rate, then divide by 600. That makes sense because the units need to convert from hectares per hour to minutes.\n\nSo, if someone has a specific working width in meters, a driving speed in km/h, and an application rate in kg/ha, they can plug those numbers into this formula to get the flowrate in kg/min.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other formulas mentioned elsewhere. On page 69, there's an example with slug pellets where they use a specific table, but it seems like that's more of a lookup method rather than a general formula. Similarly, on page 70, another example uses the same approach as page 68.\n\nSo, the key formula is indeed:\n\nflowrate (kg/min) = (Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)) / 600\n\nThis seems consistent across different pages in the context.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question: \"After disengaging the PTO shaft, what poses a continued danger and why?\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the provided context to find any relevant information. The context is a series of pages from a manual, likely about operating agricultural machinery, specifically a spreader or something similar.\n\nI remember that the PTO shaft (Power Take-Off) is connected to the tractor's engine and powers various components like spreading discs. When you disengage it, the machine should stop running because the PTO isn't providing power anymore. But the question mentions a continued danger after disengaging, so maybe there's something else going on.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see that page 94 talks about friction between moving parts and warns about accidentally touching control levers, which could cause the machine to move. That seems related because if parts are still moving due to inertia, it could be dangerous.\n\nPage 95 discusses adjusting the machine's height but doesn't directly mention PTO shaft issues. Page 97 mentions that after switching off the PTO shaft, danger arises as the machine continues running because of inertia. This is a key point. So, even though the PTO is disconnected, moving parts might still cause the machine to move, posing a risk.\n\nPage 101 also mentions that after disengaging the PTO shaft, the machine could continue moving due to inertia, which can be dangerous if someone approaches while it's still moving.\n\nPutting this together, the main danger is that the machine continues to move because of inertia after the PTO shaft is disconnected. This can happen because some components might still have momentum, making the machine unsafe to approach until it fully stops.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, continued movement due to inertia poses a danger as the machine may still advance, risking injury or accidents if approached while moving.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several pages discussing various aspects of spreading operations, including adjustments, testing, and procedures. The question specifically asks about the hopper content dropping below 100 kg, so I should focus on any sections that mention this scenario.\n\nI see that in page 101, it talks about what happens if the hopper content is less than 100 kg. It mentions that the control system switches off the automatic calibration because the measurement accuracy would decline. This makes sense because with less than 100 kg, the system can't accurately determine the application rate.\n\nAdditionally, there's a note that at low doses (less than 50 kg/ha), it's possible to reduce the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration by 15 kg. This adjustment likely helps in scenarios where very small amounts are being applied, preventing unnecessary recalibration or potential over-application.\n\nSo, putting this together, when the hopper content is below 100 kg, the automatic calibration feature is turned off because it can't reliably measure the application rate accurately. This prevents incorrect dosing and ensures that the spreader operates as intended without wasting material.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration due to reduced measurement accuracy. At doses below 50 kg/ha, the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration can be adjusted down by 15 kg.

My focus is on finding information related to sound levels specifically for a Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with the rear window open.\n\nI'll start by scanning each page's content:\n\n- Page 24 talks about application rate and dosing settings, not relevant.\n- Page 25 discusses width distribution and actuators; no sound info.\n- Page 26 is about display screens; nothing on sound.\n- Page 27 mentions RATE control but doesn't discuss noise levels.\n- Page 28 covers spreading patterns; no sound mentioned.\n- Page 29 talks about boundary track spreading, not relevant.\n- Page 30 discusses ISO control system and weighing; no sound info.\n- Page 31 is about flowrate calculations; irrelevant.\n- Page 32 deals with ISOBUS tractor connection; nothing on noise.\n- Page 33 covers the control box features; no sound levels here either.\n- Page 34 mentions extra functions like calculator, not relevant.\n- Page 35 discusses IsoMatch Grip; no sound info.\n- Page 36 has technical specifications, including weight and dimensions but no sound levels.\n- Page 37 is about sound levels! It says: \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with ExactLine (dB): 73.0\" and \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB): 87.2\". Wait, but the question specifically mentions the rear window is open.\n\nLooking closer at page 37's table:\n\n- Line 4: Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with ExactLine (dB): 73.8\n- Line 5: Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB): 84.6\n\nWait, that doesn't match what I thought earlier. Let me check again.\n\nIn the context provided, page 37 has a table:\n\n| 0 | Sound level | Closed cabin | Rear window opened |\n|---|------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| 2 | Tractor + operating, empty spreader (dB) | 71.9 | 76.2 |\n| 3 | Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) (dB) | 73.8 | 84.6 |\n| 4 | Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB) | 73.0 | 87.2 |\n\nSo, the sound levels for Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with rear window opened is 84.6 dB.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 73.8 and 84.6. Now, according to this table, when ExactLine is added, the sound level increases by a few dB. But without ExactLine, it's 73.8 for closed cabin and 76.2 with rear window open? That doesn't make sense because adding ExactLine should affect the sound.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me clarify:\n\n- Tractor + operating, empty spreader: 71.9 dB (closed cabin), 76.2 dB (rear window opened)\n- Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60): 73.8 dB (closed cabin), 84.6 dB (rear window opened)\n- Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + ExactLine: 73.0 dB (closed cabin), 87.2 dB (rear window opened)\n\nSo, the exact answer is 84.6 dB for Kali 60 with rear window open.\n\nI think that's the correct figure from the table.\n</think>\n\nThe sound level of a Tractor plus spreading spreader (Kali 60) with its rear window opened is **73.8 dB** when closed and **84.6 dB** when the rear window is opened. However, since the question specifically asks for the sound level with the rear window open, the precise answer is:\n\n**84.6 dB**\n\nAnswer: 84.6 dB",

It mentions that if you suspect damage to the vanes or spreading disc, you should check them. Specifically, it says: \"Examine the spreading discs and the discharge opening to see what the cause of the failure/stoppage is.\" So, this indicates that the vanes are part of the examination process when there's a problem.\n\nMoving on to page 125, which lists maintenance intervals. There's a table here that outlines various checks and their intervals. I'm looking for any mention of vanes or related components. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- Condition of the vanes is listed under \"Condition of the vanes\" with an interval of \"\u00b7\" which usually denotes an annual check.\n- Checking and setting the dosing mechanism is every 10 hours, then weekly, etc., but that's about the dosing, not the vanes.\n\nWait, on page 115 again, it says: \"If you still cannot see the cause, carefully remove the vanes to see better into the discharge opening of the discharge bushing.\" So, this suggests that vanes are something that can be inspected when there's a problem, but I need to find the specific interval for routine inspection.\n\nLooking back at page 125, under \"Maintenance intervals,\" the table shows:\n\n- Condition of the vanes: \u00b7 (probably annual)\n- Checking and setting the dosing mechanism: after first 10 hours, weekly, etc.\n- Other checks like bolts and nuts are more frequent.\n\nSo, it seems that the condition of the vanes is checked at least once a year.

It also says that if the distance isn't equal, the dosing plate can be adjusted accordingly. This seems related to ensuring proper alignment, which would affect both the bushing height and the discharge setting.\n\nThen, looking at page 136, it specifically discusses checking and setting the discharge point mechanism. It mentions that if there's a difference in the application rate between the left and right spreading discs (more than 3%), it could be due to a misalignment of the discharge point relative to the spreading discs. The exact measurement required is given as 109 mm between the inside of the rope and the opening of the discharge bushing.\n\nNow, regarding how often this should be done: On page 133, it says that the dosing mechanism settings should be checked after the first 10 running hours, for each season, and every 100 operational hours. Additionally, if there's a significant difference in the spreading pattern between the left and right discs (more than 3%), the discharge point needs adjustment.\n\nSo, putting this together, the bushing height and discharge setting should be checked at least once after the first 10 hours, then regularly every 100 hours or seasonally.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part of this means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is M6, which refers to its size. In metric bolts, M6 means the bolt has a nominal diameter of 6 mm. Next, it's a hexagon bolt, so it has six sides on the head, which is standard for hexagonal screw heads.\n\nThe material is stainless steel, which is good because it's durable and resistant to corrosion. The quality is 70 (A2). I think this refers to the strength grade of the bolt. A2 probably stands for a specific level of tensile strength. I'm not entirely sure about the exact meaning here, but I can look it up or make an educated guess.\n\nThe friction coefficient is given as 0.2. This tells me that when I'm tightening the bolt, the friction between the bolt and the nut will be 0.2 times the applied torque. So, if I apply a certain amount of torque, the actual clamping force on the bolt will be higher due to this friction.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided in the context, it's labeled \"Steel tightening torques\" and lists different qualities like M5, M6, etc., with corresponding torques for different friction coefficients. The table seems to provide maximum torques that should be applied when fastening bolts of certain qualities and materials.\n\nI need to find the row for M6 and 0.2 friction. Scanning through the table:\n\n- For M6 and 0.20 friction, the torque is listed as 9.4 Nm.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The table has columns for different qualities and rows for specific materials. So, under \"M6\" and with a friction coefficient of 0.20, the torque value is indeed 9.4 Nm.\n\nBut I should make sure that this is the correct interpretation. Sometimes, tables can be structured differently, but in this case, it seems straightforward: each row corresponds to a specific material (like M6), and each column has different friction coefficients (0.10 or 0.20). So, for M6 with 0.20 friction, it's 9.4 Nm.\n\nI also recall that when tightening bolts, especially self-locking ones like Tensilock or Whizlock, the torque can be higher due to their design preventing loosening. However, in this table, the values are based on standard torques without additional considerations for specific lock types. But since the question doesn't mention anything about self-locking nuts, I think it's safe to stick with the given value.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the torque required is 9.4 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient is **9.4 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:** 9.4 Nm",

The problem number 6 mentions \"Incorrect application rates (kg per hectare)\" but that seems more about dosage than blockage.\n\nContinuing to page 153, another troubleshooting section.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether fine application is more expensive than normal dosing. Let me start by looking through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are mentions of \"Fine application\" and \"Normal dosing.\" The context talks about how these settings affect the spreader's operation. \n\nLooking at page 24, it says that the spreader has two actuators to set the application rate independently. Fine application setting allows for precise control, especially at low flow rates, which helps prevent blockages. It also mentions that with fine application, only one dosing opening is open wider, allowing a reliable flow even at low rates.\n\nOn page 25, it discusses the GEOSPREAD function and how it adjusts the discharge point to ensure proper spreading patterns. There's no direct mention of cost here, but it does talk about optimizing fertilizer use.\n\nPage 27 mentions RATE control with something called MULTIRATE, which automatically adjusts application rates based on external signals. It also notes that this doesn't require an additional license key and works with the spreader software to correct dosing settings.\n\nLooking at page 31, it explains how the flowrate is calculated using working width, driving speed, and application rate. Automatic calibration tests help determine the right dosing setting for each fertilizer type. It also mentions that if the hopper has less than 100 kg, the system switches off automatic calibration, affecting measurement accuracy.\n\nPage 32 talks about the ISO control system using ISOBUS communication to measure fertilizer quantity and correct application rates. This seems more about functionality than cost.\n\nOn page 33, it's about the IsoMatch control box with extra functions like a calculator and camera, but nothing on cost.\n\nPage 34 discusses the IsoMatch Grip accessory for controlling machine functions, again not touching on cost.\n\nFinally, page 36 lists technical specifications of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD model, including weight, hopper capacity, etc. There's no mention here of pricing or cost differences between settings.\n\nPutting this together, while there are details about how fine application works and its benefits, I don't see any direct information on whether it's more expensive than normal dosing. The context focuses on functionality rather than cost.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

From the context provided, it seems like this method involves spreading fertilizer right up to the edge of a field or garden using something called ExactLine. The idea is that it reduces loss over the border and provides as full a spreading pattern as possible.\n\nNow, the question is about small gardens. I should look for information in the context that mentions how suitable one-sided boundary spreading is for smaller areas. Looking through the pages, especially page 29, it says that ExactLine can be used to spread right up to the border of the garden. It also mentions that environmental standards allow minimal loss over the edge, which is good for small gardens where you don't want too much fertilizer going beyond the intended area.\n\nAdditionally, the spreading pattern with ExactLine is designed to minimize loss, making it efficient even in smaller spaces. There's no information suggesting that one-sided boundary spreading isn't suitable for small gardens, so I can infer that it is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nOne-sided boundary spreading with ExactLine is suitable for small gardens as it allows precise application close to the edge and minimizes fertilizer loss beyond the garden border.\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens.",

It also mentions that if the tractor doesn't have an ISOBUS connection, you can add the IsoMatch power cable set to make it ISOBUS ready.\n\nLooking further, on page 39, there's a mention of using the IM Tellus Input cable for connections beyond just the CAN plug. It says that if you use the IsoMatch control box with a tractor that isn't equipped with ISOBUS, you need an extra cable set, which includes the IM Tellus Input cable. This cable is used to connect the control box to the tractor's electronics.\n\nAdditionally, on page 41, it explains that the IM Tellus Input cable can be connected to the tractor's CAN connection when using the IsoMatch control box with a standard tractor that doesn't have ISOBUS communication. This allows the control box to communicate with the tractor and other systems.\n\nSo, putting this together, the IM Tellus Input cable is used for connecting the IsoMatch control box to the tractor's CAN connection.

Scanning through the pages, on page 33 it says: \"The divided colour screen has a flexible division to: \u00b7 Operate 2 programmes or functions simultaneously on screen, e.g. the main screen of your machine and a separate operating program. This can be done without having to switch.\" It also mentions that the IsoMatch terminal can be used with a touch screen.\n\nThen, looking at page 34, it talks about additional features like a calculator, internet browser, camera screen (optional), status bar, etc. It specifically mentions that the main switch is on the upper left in the red extension and how to use it.\n\nOn page 35, IsoMatch Grip is discussed as an accessory with control buttons, but that's separate from the terminal itself.\n\nNow, looking for any mention of connecting external devices like a mouse. On page 33 again, it says: \"The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM. The extra sensor is available for this purpose.\" But that's about sensors, not a mouse.\n\nWait, on page 34, under \"Extra functions,\" it lists things like a calculator, internet browser, camera screen (optional), and status bar. It also mentions saving and reading documents, tractor data, field data, etc. So the terminal can display these on its screen, but I don't see anything about connecting an external mouse.\n\nHowever, page 34 does mention: \"Compact and complete IsoMatch Go... absence of Wlan/Wifi.\" But that's about connectivity options, not specifically a mouse connection.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Page 33 says the terminal can operate two programs simultaneously on screen without switching. It also mentions that all keys are directly on the touch screen. So it seems like the terminal doesn't have USB ports or other connections for external devices like a mouse.\n\nBut wait, page 34 does mention: \"Quick menu navigation with the scroll wheel and additional keys.\" So it uses a scroll wheel on the upper right of the box for navigation. That suggests that the interface is touch-based or uses a physical scroll wheel rather than supporting external input like a mouse.\n\nSo putting this together, IsoMatch Tellus likely doesn't have a connection for an external mouse. It's designed to be operated via its own screen and controls, possibly with a touch interface or physical buttons, but not necessarily supporting external devices like mice.\n</think>\n\nThe IsoMatch Tellus terminal does not support connecting an external mouse. It is designed to operate using its integrated touch screen and physical controls rather than providing connections for external input devices.\n\nAnswer: No, IsoMatch Tellus cannot be connected to an external mouse.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context covers several pages, mostly about setting up and calibrating a spreader, including details about dosing settings, flowrates, and specific instructions for operations like filling, calibration tests, and spreading pattern checks.\n\nLooking specifically for mentions of the tray test, I find it on page 76. It says that a tray test checks the distribution of fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results indicate if adjustments are needed. It also mentions that this test can be performed by specialized companies or even done manually with some materials.\n\nNow, regarding the conditions for performing the tray test, I see on page 77 that weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as during the test. The tray test should be performed under dry weather, low humidity, and maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2). It also notes that the test should be done with dry weather.\n\nSo, if the temperature is 40 degrees Celsius, which is quite warm, I need to check if this falls under \"dry weather\" or not. Typically, high temperatures can lead to higher humidity or other factors affecting the test's accuracy. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention temperature restrictions beyond the general condition of dry weather.\n\nSince the context specifies that the tray test should be done with dry weather and low humidity but doesn't restrict it based on a specific temperature like 40\u00b0C, I can infer that as long as the conditions are dry, the test can proceed. Therefore, performing the tray test at 40 degrees Celsius is possible if other conditions (like low humidity and wind speed) are met.\n</think>\n\nThe tray test can be performed at 40 degrees Celsius provided the weather conditions are dry and meet the specified requirements for humidity and wind speed.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the tray test can be conducted at 40\u00b0C under appropriate weather conditions.",

The operation involves placing troughs next to a fictive ditch and adjusting the plate's position to control the spreading pattern. However, there's no direct mention of how the plate is actuated\u2014whether it uses hydraulics, pneumatics, or another method.\n\nFurther down, on page 87, there's a table that shows possible issues with the border spreading plate and adjustments needed. It refers to setting the plate more in direction 9 (towards the ditch) or 1 (away from the ditch). This suggests that the plate can be adjusted mechanically, possibly via levers or other mechanical means, but again, there's no explicit mention of pneumatics.\n\nOn page 89, when testing the ExactLine, it talks about setting the hydraulic valve to run and bringing the ExactLine to working condition. However, this is about the ExactLine, not the hydraulic border spreading plate. \n\nI don't see any specific references in the context that indicate the use of pneumatic actuators for the hydraulic border spreading plate.

It mentions that the spreader should be set at 75 cm above the ground or crops. This seems relevant because it directly relates to the height of the fertilizer when being dispersed.\n\nAnother point is on page 100, where it talks about starting spreading. It says to drive to the first tramline and then switch on the control box, setting the correct PTO shaft RPM as per the chart. However, this doesn't specify the height without GEOCONTROL.\n\nLooking further, on page 97, there's a section about using the ExactLine with tramlines. It mentions that during boundary track spreading, the working width can be adjusted by changing the ExactLine position. But again, this is more about the width than the height.\n\nOn page 105, it discusses over and underdosing, but that's not directly related to height either.\n\nThen on page 100 again, when starting spreading without GEOCONTROL, it just mentions driving to the tramline and setting the PTO shaft RPM.

This seems to be a general setting requirement, regardless of whether GEOCONTROL is used or not. So even without GEOCONTROL, the spreader's height should still be set at 75 cm.\n\nI don't see any specific information about the maximum height when not using GEOCONTROL. The context doesn't provide different heights for with and without GEOCONTROL. It just mentions that the ideal height is 75 cm to ensure proper spreading and avoid issues like chunks forming from moist fertilizer.\n\nTherefore, the maximum height the fertilizer flies would be determined by this setting, which is 75 cm above the ground or crops.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum height the fertilizer flies when spreading without GEOCONTROL headland is **75 cm** above the ground or crops.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate is. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see mentions of different spreading methods like ExactLine and hydraulic border spreading plate. The question specifically asks about seven-sided boundary spreading using the hydraulic border spreading plate. \n\nLooking through the pages, on page 107, there's a section titled \"One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate.\" It explains that when using this method, you drive along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. The hydraulic border spreading plate allows adjusting the width on the side of the field edge.\n\nWait, but the question mentions seven-sided. Hmm, I don't recall seeing \"seven-sided\" mentioned in the context provided. It talks about one-sided or two-sided methods, like ExactLine and others, but not seven-sided. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of seven-sided spreading. Scanning through the pages again, I don't find anything related to seven sides. The closest is page 107 talking about one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic plate.\n\nPerhaps the user meant \"one-sided\" instead of \"seven-sided.\" If that's the case, then based on page 107, it involves driving along the field edge and using the hydraulic plate to spread from the border inwards. \n\nBut since the question specifically says seven-sided, I'm not sure. Without more information about seven-sided spreading in the context, I can't provide an accurate answer. Maybe it's a term not covered here or a mistake.\n\nI should also consider that maybe \"seven-sided\" refers to a specific feature of the hydraulic plate, but from what's provided, it doesn't mention seven sides. It mainly discusses adjusting the spread width on the field edge.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the context given, there's no information about seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate. The closest related info is one-sided boundary spreading.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide information about \"seven-sided boundary spreading\" using the hydraulic border spreading plate. It discusses one-sided and other methods but not seven-sided.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the appropriate measures for road transport are when stopping work. Let me look through the context provided.\n\nI see several pages, from 112 to 117, which talk about stopping work and preparing the machine for transport. Page 112 specifically mentions \"Stopping work\" and lists steps like closing dosing units, switching off the PTO shaft, switching off the electronic control system, switching the tractor off, removing keys, engaging the parking brake, cleaning remains from the crop, fixing the hopper cover, and taking measures for road transport.\n\nPage 113 talks about failure and stoppage but doesn't add much to the stopping work measures. Page 114 discusses working methods when there's a failure but again, not directly related to transport measures. Pages 115-117 focus more on storage and maintenance rather than transport specifically.\n\nSo, from page 112, the key steps are:\n1. Close dosing units.\n2. Switch off PTO shaft.\n3. Switch off electronic control system.\n4. Switch tractor off, remove keys.\n5. Engage parking brake.\n6. Remove remains from crop, dirt, stones.\n7. Fix hopper cover.\n8. Take appropriate measures for road transport.\n\nI should make sure to list these steps clearly and concisely without adding any extra information not directly related to stopping work for transport.\n</think>\n\nWhen stopping work for road transport, the following measures should be taken:\n\n1. Close all dosing units.\n2. Switch off the PTO shaft.\n3. Switch off the electronic control system.\n4. Switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition.\n5. Engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n6. Remove any remains from the crop, dirt, or stones.\n7. Fix the hopper cover.\n8. Take all appropriate measures for road transport.\n\nThese steps ensure the machine is prepared safely for transportation.",

But when there's damage involved, especially from a hard object, it points towards issues with the spreading discs or discharge bushing.\n\nOn page 115, it says that if damage is present, such as to the vanes or spreading disc, it's most likely caused by a hard object blocking the flow. This makes sense because if something hard gets stuck in the machine, it can cause wear and tear over time.\n\nPage 114 also talks about how hard objects can block the supply to the agitator or the dosing openings, leading to damage. So, when there's visible damage, a hard object is the primary suspect.\n\nPutting this together, the most likely reason for such damage is the presence of a hard object interfering with the machine's operation.\n</think>\n\nDamage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing is most likely caused by a hard object blocking the flow through these components.",

But when I look for information related to someone who fell into fertilizer, I don't see any direct mention of what to do in that situation.\n\nI'll go through each page one by one. Page 105 talks about over- and underdosing and how the spreader works. Pages 106-111 discuss different spreading methods like boundary spreading and using ExactLine. These pages focus on how to apply fertilizer correctly but don't touch on what to do if someone is covered in it.\n\nPages 112-120 cover operating procedures, stopping work, failure handling, storing the machine, and preparing for winter storage. Again, no mention of first aid or what to do after falling into fertilizer.\n\nPage 121 mentions maintenance intervals, Page 122 talks about repair safety, and Pages 123-128 discuss lubrication points and applying grease. None of these pages provide any information on handling a person who's fallen into fertilizer.\n\nPage 129 gives torque specifications for bolts and nuts, which is unrelated. So, after going through all the context, I don't find any specific advice on what to do if someone falls into fertilizer without a physician available.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there's no information that directly addresses this situation.

Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll search for any mention of grease nipples in the context. Scanning through the pages, I see that page 126 talks about lubricating points, specifically mentioning grease nipples. It says, \"All lubricating nipples of the machine can be filled with a universal grease type.\" Then, on page 124, there's a section about oil and grease content which warns, \"Never use more oil or grease than prescribed. A too high oil level may result in an overheated machine and damaged seals.\"\n\nSo, if the grease nipples aren't lubricated, it could lead to an overheated machine and damaged seals. This makes sense because without proper lubrication, parts might wear out faster or cause other mechanical issues.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other relevant information. Looking further, page 127 discusses applying or adding grease, specifically mentioning the coupling shaft profiled tubes and central gearboxes. It says that if the halves of the coupling shaft aren't sliding smoothly, you should grease them. This reinforces the idea that lack of lubrication can cause problems.\n\nAlso, on page 125, there's a maintenance interval table which includes greasing the coupling shaft, actuators, discharge bushings, and central gearboxes. Not greasing these could lead to wear or failure.\n\nPutting it all together, not lubricating the grease nipples can indeed cause overheating and damage to seals, leading to potential machine breakdowns.\n</think>\n\nIf the machine's grease nipples are never lubricated, it can result in an overheated machine and damaged seals. This is because proper lubrication prevents friction and ensures smooth operation of mechanical components.",

However, it does talk about protecting against corrosion with a preserving liquid, which is different from regular paint. Since there's no specific paint brand or type mentioned, maybe the answer is that no specific paint is detailed beyond general maintenance practices.\n\nWait, but on page 117, it says to patch breaks in the paint and then apply a preserving liquid. So perhaps the paint used is just standard automotive paint for touching up damaged areas, but the context doesn't specify the exact brand or type.

On page 2, it mentions that the machine is an Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD GS3, and it's used for spreading fertilizers. \n\nLooking at page 4, there's a section called \"Target group of this manual\" which states that the manual is intended for agrarians and others trained in agriculture. It also emphasizes that these individuals must be competent to operate the machine as required by national legislation and have knowledge of assembly activities.\n\nOn page 11, under \"Authorisation,\" it specifies that only authorized persons can use the machine. An authorized person is someone who has received training as required by national authorities and has taken responsibility as described in paragraph \"Person\" on page 10. This suggests that training is a prerequisite for authorization.\n\nPage 19 reiterates that the machine may only be operated after proper training, emphasizing the importance of understanding all systems and control elements before use. It also mentions that maintenance and repairs must be performed by experts, further indicating that specialized knowledge is necessary.\n\nPutting this together, the curriculum likely includes both theoretical training on how the machine operates, safety protocols, and practical skills in assembling and maintaining the equipment.

Page 22 mentions avoiding contact with materials when cleaning the machine and wearing protective clothing like safety gloves, shoes, and goggles. It also notes that contact with materials could lead to injury and advises consulting a physician if injured.\n\nPage 21 talks about maintenance and repairs, emphasizing that only authorised experts should perform them.

It advises removing remnants before welding, cutting, or grinding on the machine. This implies that cleaning is necessary but with precautions.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about safety gloves for cleaning before welding. Page 22 doesn't specify the type of gloves needed, only that protective clothing should be worn. However, in other parts of the context, like page 19, it's mentioned that the machine should not be modified or cleaned without proper protection, and that maintenance should be done by experts.\n\nSince the question is about cleaning before welding, which involves handling potentially hazardous materials (like nitrate fertilisers), the safest approach would be to use gloves that provide adequate protection against chemicals and sharp objects. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the type of gloves, only that protective clothing in general should be worn.\n\nGiven this, I can infer that any gloves used for cleaning would need to be sturdy enough to protect against cuts or chemical exposure.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system. Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see that the context covers various pages from 20 to 44, but most of it is about safety, maintenance, and how to use the machine for spreading fertilizer. However, starting from page 33 onwards, there's information related to the IsoMatch control box and ISOBUS communication.\n\nPage 33 mentions that the IsoMatch control box has many functions and is described as a universal ISOBUS terminal. It also talks about the IsoMatch Tellus GO, which is a compact version with complete ISO control. The key here is that it supports ISOBUS communication between the tractor and implement.\n\nLooking at page 34, it discusses additional features of the IsoMatch control box, including its ability to handle various functions through ISOBUS. It also mentions that the IsoMatch Tellus GO connects via an IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable for tractors with full ISOBUS connections.\n\nPage 35 introduces the IsoMatch Grip accessory, which allows central operation of implement functions using a single handle. This is part of the ISOBUS system.\n\nMoving to page 36, there's a table listing technical specifications, but it doesn't directly mention communication protocols or bandwidths. However, pages 37 and 38 talk about assembly and safety before use, not technical specs.\n\nPage 39 discusses control box assembly, mentioning that IsoMatch can be used with tractors equipped with ISOBUS. Page 40 talks about mounting the console on the control box, again focusing on setup rather than technical details.\n\nPage 41 provides information on using IsoMatch terminals on ISO tractors and non-ISO tractors. It mentions that for non-ISO tractors, an extra cable set is needed, which includes a CAN plug connection to the control box.\n\nPage 42 discusses hopper extensions and covers, not relevant here.\n\nPage 43 and 44 talk about vanes and accessories, again unrelated to communication protocols.\n\nSo, from the context, I gather that IsoMatch systems support ISOBUS communication. The specific versions mentioned are IsoMatch Tellus and IsoMatch Grip, which are part of the ISOBUS protocol. However, there's no detailed information on bandwidth capabilities or different protocol versions beyond their compatibility with tractors equipped with ISOBUS.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide specifics like maximum bandwidth or supported protocols beyond stating that they use ISOBUS, I can only conclude based on what's given. There's no mention of different ISOBUS versions (like v1.x, v2.x) or their technical specs.\n</think>\n\nThe IsoMatch system supports ISOBUS communication for tractors equipped with the protocol. Specific details about bandwidth capabilities or different ISOBUS versions are not provided in the context.\n\nAnswer: The IsoMatch system is compatible with ISOBUS communication protocols but does not specify detailed technical specifications or bandwidth capabilities beyond supporting ISOBUS-equipped tractors.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many hours the IsoMatch Tellus can operate before flattening a typical tractor battery if left switched on with the engine off. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 34, there's a section about the IsoMatch Tellus control box. It mentions that if the box is engaged but not properly turned off, it could cause unintended functions to be activated while in the danger area. Moreover, it uses power, which can flatten the tractor battery. The text also says to always switch off the control box when leaving the tractor because otherwise, the battery might get drained.\n\nOn page 39, there's a section about the control box assembly. It warns that if the IsoMatch or another loose-standing ISO-control box is used without being properly switched off, it can cause issues like draining the battery. The instructions emphasize turning it off and removing the key to prevent unintended operation.\n\nPage 41 discusses the IsoMatch terminal on an ISO tractor. It mentions connecting the control box via CAN cable but doesn't directly address battery life. However, earlier pages stress the importance of switching off the control box to avoid battery drain.\n\nSince there's no specific information about battery capacity or consumption rates in the context, I can't calculate exact hours. But based on standard batteries and typical usage, I know that modern tractor batteries can last several hours before being drained significantly. However, without specifics, it's safer to note that the control box should be turned off to prevent flattening the battery.\n</think>\n\nThe IsoMatch Tellus control box should be switched off when not in use to avoid draining the tractor's battery. There is no specific information provided about how long it can operate before flattening the battery, but it is clear that leaving it on with the engine off can drain the battery over time.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

The baud rate refers to how many signal changes (bits) occur per second, which determines the speed of data transfer.\n\nLooking through the context provided, I see that on page 72, there's a mention of \"RS 232 connection\" and that it's located at the back of the control box.

These are common because they're widely supported by many devices and systems. Since the context doesn't specify a particular baud rate, I can infer based on typical RS-232 configurations.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum baud rate. Among the standard rates, 1200 bps is the lowest commonly used. It's sufficient for most applications and ensures compatibility across different hardware setups. There's no indication in the context that a lower rate would be necessary or supported, so 1200 bps seems like the logical answer.\n</think>\n\nThe minimum baud rate for an RS-232 connection is typically **1200 bits per second (bps)**.

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of wind speed in the context. Scanning through each page, I see that on page 96, there's a section about \"Use in the field\" which includes a checklist. One of the points is about wind speed: \"Wind speed too high?\" It seems like this is a consideration when assessing spreading quality.\n\nNow, I need to find out what specific limit is mentioned regarding wind speed affecting the spreading process. Continuing through the context, on page 105, there's a section titled \"Over and underdosing\" which mentions that with small working widths using a triangular spreading pattern, the first and second passes overlap completely. This can affect application rates.\n\nLooking further, on page 97, it talks about setting tramlines and the importance of good distribution to prevent drive errors, especially in large working widths. It also mentions the use of GEOCONTROL to adjust overlaps.\n\nOn page 98, discussing \"Tramline patterns\" with ExactLine, it says that driving half the working width from the field edge is done when using boundary track spreading. This might relate to wind speed affecting how the spreader operates.\n\nPage 99 discusses using the hydraulic border spreading plate and mentions testing the spreading pattern as per page 84. It doesn't directly mention wind speed here.\n\nPage 100 talks about starting spreading, including connecting headlands with GEOCONTROL. There's no direct reference to wind speed here either.\n\nPage 101 covers \"Use in the field\" and some operational aspects, but again, nothing specific about wind speed limits.\n\nPage 102 discusses working on the headland, which might be affected by wind, but it doesn't specify a limit.\n\nPage 103 is about using the hydraulic border spreading plate without GEOCONTROL. No mention of wind here.\n\nPage 104 covers GEOCONTROL headland function, again no direct reference to wind speed limits.\n\nPage 105 discusses over and underdosing based on soil or crop conditions. It mentions that with small working widths, overlapping can cause issues, but not specifically about wind.\n\nPage 106 is about border spreading methods, both one-sided and boundary track. No mention of wind here.\n\nPage 107 details one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic plate, focusing on application rates and loss limits, not wind.\n\nPage 108 discusses procedures with the hydraulic plate, again nothing about wind speed.\n\nPage 109 talks about driving patterns, mentioning two situations: working from sprayer tramlines or without them. It includes adjusting PTO shaft RPM but doesn't tie it to wind speed.\n\nFinally, on page 96, under \"Use in the field,\" there's a checklist item: \"Wind speed too high?\" This seems like a consideration, but I need to see if any specific limit is given elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps earlier in the context, when discussing testing the spreading pattern, there might be something about wind affecting tests. Let me check page 84 again. It says to perform a calibration test first and determine dosing settings before checking the spreading pattern. Changes to dosing affect spreading. But no specific wind speed limit here.\n\nSimilarly, on page 87, it's about testing the hydraulic border spreading plate, mentioning maximum loss in the ditch as 10%. No mention of wind.\n\nSo, after reviewing all pages, the only direct mention related to wind is on page 96: \"Wind speed too high?\" without a specific limit.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context covers a lot of pages, each with specific instructions about using a machine in the field. It mentions things like adjusting the spreader settings, ensuring safety, and details about different spreading methods such as boundary track spreading and one-sided boundary spreading.\n\nI'm looking for information related to driving speed during border spreading. I remember seeing something about PTO shaft RPM adjustments. Let me scan through the pages again.\n\nPage 100 talks about starting spreading and mentions that the rpm of the tractor engine must remain constant while spreading to distribute fertilizer along the width. It also says that the driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed, which implies that during border spreading, the speed might need to be controlled differently.\n\nLooking further, page 109 discusses driving patterns when using sprayer tramlines. It mentions decreasing the PTO shaft rpm to 75% and then increasing it again after a certain point. This seems relevant because adjusting the PTO speed affects how much fertilizer is applied over the width.\n\nPage 100 specifically states that during border spreading, the application rate can deviate from the required setting if not managed properly. It mentions that the control system does automatic calibration but notes that this doesn't work well if the hopper is being filled while spreading.\n\nWait, I'm looking for the optimal driving speed reduction percentage to compensate for the application rate. Page 100 says that the PTO shaft rpm must remain constant while spreading. However, page 109 talks about decreasing the PTO shaft rpm to 75% during the first pass and then increasing it back to 100%. This suggests a 25% reduction (from 100% to 75%) during part of the process.\n\nBut does this directly relate to compensating for application rate? The context mentions that without proper settings, the application rate can deviate. So, by reducing the PTO speed, the machine's operation is adjusted to ensure even distribution.\n\nPutting it together, the optimal driving speed reduction percentage mentioned in the context is 25%, as seen on page 109 where the PTO shaft rpm is decreased to 75% from 100%.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for the application rate is **25%**.

It says to drive along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. But again, it's more about the method than the specific distance.\n\nLooking at page 109, when using the ExactLine, it specifies driving in the first sprayer tramline or half the working width (1/2 X meters) from the field edge. This seems to confirm that the first path is at 0.5X meters.\n\nPage 110 also mentions driving half the working width from the field edge for boundary track spreading with ExactLine, which aligns with what I found earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the distance tolerance when driving the first path for border spreading is half the working width, which is (1/2 X) meters. Since the question asks for the numerical value in meters, and assuming X is the total working width, the answer would be 0.5X meters.\n</think>\n\nThe distance tolerance from the field edge when driving the first path for border spreading is **0.5X meters**, where X represents the total working width of the field.\n\n**Answer:** 0.5X meters",

        "question": "Can the parking support withstand storage on a slope of 10 degrees?",
        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the parking support can handle storing the machine on a 10-degree slope. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, I'm looking for any mention of slopes or inclines in relation to storage. The context has several pages discussing various aspects like maintenance, storage tips, and specific instructions for storing the machine. \n\nOn page 119, there's a section about disconnecting the machine safely. It mentions placing the machine on a stable, level base. That suggests that the parking support should be on a flat surface.\n\nPage 120 talks about preparing the machine for transport by placing it on a firm, stable ramp if needed. This indicates that when moving the machine, especially over slopes, additional supports might be necessary to ensure stability.\n\nLooking at page 121, which is about preparation for winter storage, it again emphasizes storing the machine on a stable base and mentions cleaning and lubrication before storage. There's no direct mention of slopes here, but the focus is on ensuring the machine is secure and in good condition.\n\nPage 117 discusses storing the machine and mentions avoiding contact with materials and wearing protective clothing. It also talks about placing the machine on a stable base, which aligns with the need for level ground.\n\nNow, considering the question specifically about a 10-degree slope, I'm trying to find if there's any information that addresses the machine's ability to be stored on such a slope without causing issues. The context doesn't explicitly mention slopes, but it does stress the importance of a stable base and avoiding tilting or uneven surfaces.\n\nSince the parking support is designed for stability, it's reasonable to infer that it can handle a 10-degree slope as long as the machine is placed correctly and supported properly. However, without explicit instructions on maximum slope angles, I can't be certain if 10 degrees is within acceptable limits.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, the safest answer based on the provided context would be \"Unknown\" because there's no direct information about the parking support's capacity to handle slopes.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the parking support's ability to withstand storage on a slope of 10 degrees. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**Unknown**",

        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what should be done at the start of the spring season to prepare the machine for work beyond just cleaning and lubrication. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at page 121, it talks about preparation for winter storage, which includes cleaning and lubrication. But the question is about the spring season, so I need to find something related to that.\n\nOn page 122, there's a section on maintenance that mentions repairing damage safely and without delay. It includes things like placing the machine on a firm surface, switching off systems, wearing protective clothing, etc. This seems relevant because it's about preparing the machine for use after winter storage.\n\nPage 123 discusses not modifying the machine and using only original parts. It also talks about tightening bolts and nuts regularly, which is important for maintenance but might be more about ongoing care than preparation at the start of the season.\n\nPage 124 deals with oil and grease content, specifying types and quantities. This is about routine maintenance but doesn't directly answer what to do specifically at the start of spring.\n\nPage 125 lists maintenance intervals, including checks like bolts and nuts, hydraulic system inspection, etc. These are regular checks that might be part of preparation but aren't specific to the start of the season.\n\nPage 126 explains lubricating points, focusing on grease nipples and specific parts. Again, this is about routine maintenance.\n\nPage 127 covers applying or adding grease, detailing how to do it for various components like coupling shafts and gearboxes. This seems like a part of preparation but isn't specifically tied to the start of spring.\n\nPage 128 talks about adding oil to connectors, which is another maintenance task but not season-specific.\n\nPage 129 provides steel tightening torques, which is more about assembly and less about preparation.\n\nPage 130 discusses checking hydraulic systems, emphasizing safety and proper procedures. This is important for any maintenance but again, not specifically about spring preparation beyond regular checks.\n\nPage 131 covers replacing hydraulic hoses, stressing the importance of using original parts and proper mounting. This is a critical part of machine care but not directly tied to seasonal preparation.\n\nPage 132 mentions inspection criteria for hydraulic hoses, reiterating the need for replacement if damaged. This is about ongoing maintenance.\n\nNow, considering all these pages, the key points related to preparation at the start of spring would likely involve more than just cleaning and lubrication. It might include checking for wear, ensuring safety systems are functioning, and possibly specific tasks like testing hydraulic functions or ensuring all moving parts are in good condition after winter storage.\n\nLooking back, page 121 specifically mentions preparing the machine for winter storage, which includes cleaning and lubrication. But since we're talking about spring, perhaps the opposite\u2014ensuring everything is ready after winter. This might involve similar steps but in reverse, like checking for damage from winter conditions, ensuring all fluids are at the correct levels, and testing systems.\n\nHowever, the context provided doesn't explicitly mention spring preparation beyond what's related to maintenance. So, based on the given information, the most precise answer would be about performing routine checks and maintenance tasks typically done at the start of the season, such as checking hydraulic systems, tightening bolts, ensuring proper lubrication, and possibly replacing any worn parts identified during inspection.\n</think>\n\nTo prepare the machine for work at the start of the spring season beyond cleaning and lubrication, perform a comprehensive check of all systems, including hydraulic functions, bolt tensions, and fluid levels. Ensure safety systems are operational and replace any worn or damaged components identified during inspection.\n\n**Answer:** Perform routine checks such as hydraulic system inspection, tightening of bolts and nuts, ensuring proper lubrication, and replacing any worn parts to prepare the machine for spring operations.",

        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many operational hours the \"vanes\" of this spreader can typically last before needing replacement. Let me start by going through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of vanes in the context. Scanning through each page, on page 115, there's a section about damage and maintenance. It says that if you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing, the failure is likely caused by a hard object. So, vanes are part of the machine that can get damaged.\n\nMoving on, page 116 talks about stoppages due to encrusted fertilizer layers. It mentions trying to reduce lumps with tools but also says if you can't reach them, you might have to empty the hopper and clean. However, this doesn't directly mention operational hours for vanes.\n\nPage 117 is about storing the machine, which isn't relevant here. Page 118 discusses storage tips and cleaning, again not directly related to vanes' lifespan.\n\nLooking at page 119, it's about disconnecting the machine safely. No info on vanes there. Page 120 talks about preparing for winter storage, but still nothing about vanes' lifespan.\n\nPage 121 is about preparation for winter storage, similar to page 118. Page 122 discusses repair safety and maintenance intervals. It mentions checking the condition of the vanes as part of maintenance, but doesn't specify how often they need replacing based on hours.\n\nPage 123 warns against modifications and contact with materials, not relevant. Page 124 talks about oil and grease content, which is more about lubrication than replacement time.\n\nPage 125 lists maintenance intervals, including checking the condition of vanes every 43 operational hours. Wait, that's a specific number: \"Condition of the vanes\" is checked every 43 hours. So, this suggests that vanes should be inspected regularly, but does it mean they need to be replaced after 43 hours? Or is 43 the interval for checking, not replacement?\n\nLooking back at page 115 again, when damage occurs, repair is needed before continuing. But there's no mention of how often they wear out or require replacement based on hours.\n\nWait, in page 125's maintenance intervals table, under \"Condition of the vanes\" it says every 43 operational hours. So, perhaps this means that vanes should be checked every 43 hours, but does that mean they need to be replaced after that time? Or is it just a check interval?\n\nI'm not entirely sure if 43 hours is the replacement interval or just a check interval. The context doesn't explicitly state that vanes need replacing after 43 hours, only that their condition should be checked every 43 hours.\n\nSo, based on this, I can't confirm an exact operational hour for replacement. The closest is that they're checked every 43 hours, but without more info, I can't say how long they last before needing replacement.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information about the typical operational hours before vanes require replacement. However, it mentions that vanes should be checked every 43 operational hours as part of maintenance.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the pages, I see that maintenance is a big topic. On page 128, it mentions something about connectors and how they should be lubricated to prevent corrosion and difficulty in use. It specifically says: \"The following parts only function well if they are provided with sufficient oil. Check this regularly.\" Then, under the section for adding oil on page 128, it states: \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding and becoming difficult to use.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that connectors need a suitable lubricant to prevent corrosion. The lubricant mentioned is oil, specifically a suitable one. It's not just any oil; it has to be appropriate for the job at hand.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything else. Let me check other pages related to lubricants. On page 124, there's a table listing grease types and quantities, but that's about grease nipples, not connectors. Page 127 talks about greasing profiled tubes on the coupling shaft, which is different from connectors.\n\nPage 128 seems to be the only one directly addressing connectors and the need for lubrication. It specifies using oil as the suitable lubricant to prevent corrosion. There's no mention of other types like grease in this context, so I can focus solely on oil.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that a suitable oil is recommended for lubricating connectors to prevent corrosion.\n</think>\n\nThe suitable lubricant recommended for connectors to prevent corrosion is **oil**.",

The text talks about setting the position of the dosing mechanism and says to loosen the nuts on the fastening bolts. It specifically uses terms like \"fastening bolt,\" which suggests that these are likely hexagonal bolts or something similar.\n\nMoving to page 135, it again refers to \"Fixing knobs\" and mentions loosening the nuts on the 4 fastening bolts. This reinforces that the mechanism involves securing components with bolts that might require a specific screwdriver type.\n\nPage 134 also mentions \"fastening bolt nuts,\" which are typically hexagonal in design, commonly requiring a Phillips screwdriver. However, some agricultural machinery might use flathead screws for certain applications, but given the context of adjusting the dosing mechanism, it's more likely to be Phillips.\n\nI don't see any explicit mention of whether these bolts are flathead or Phillips, but based on standard practices and common tools used in such machinery, a Phillips screwdriver is probably needed.

It says to remove the agitator and support the fertiliser bearing ring so it doesn't drop. Then, remove the three fastening bolts from the seal rings and replace them if necessary. This suggests that the seal rings are part of the machine's structure around the agitator.\n\nHowever, page 140 specifically mentions replacing the agitator axle seal every season and after 100 hours.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the specific extension cable length in meters that's optimal for an ISO 11786 in-cab tractor connection. Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll scan each page to see if there's any mention of extension cables related to ISO 11786. \n\nLooking at page 144: It talks about an \"Extended ISO cable\" which replaces a short cable already fitted. The exact length isn't specified here, but it mentions that the extended ISO cable is available for a tractor-trailed spreader.\n\nMoving on to page 145: This page discusses the IsoMatch control box and its accessories. There's a mention of an \"extended ISO cable\" again, but no specific length provided.\n\nPage 146 also refers to an \"Extended ISO cable\" without giving measurements.\n\nPage 147 doesn't add any new information about cables.\n\nPage 148 mentions a \"hydraulic border spreading plate,\" which isn't relevant here.\n\nPage 149 talks about a calibration container and drain kit, not cables.\n\nPage 150 discusses hopper extensions and covers, again no cable info.\n\nPage 151 is about parking wheels and mud guards.\n\nPage 152 starts the troubleshooting section, but nothing about cables.\n\nPage 153 continues with more troubleshooting, still no relevant info.\n\nPage 154 discusses issues with the control box and external systems, but no cable length.\n\nFinally, page 155 is about disposal of machine parts, not related to cables.\n\nI don't see any specific measurements given in the context. The only mention is that an extended ISO cable replaces a short one, but without a specified length. Therefore, I can't extract an exact number from the provided text.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the duration of the free test period for the GEOCONTROL software user licence. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 145, there's a mention of the GEOCONTROL software being an advanced application for precise fertilizer spreading. It says that a user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop after the expiry of a free test period. The exact wording is: \"A user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop which, after the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with...\"\n\nNow, I need to find out how long this test period lasts. Scanning through the pages, I don't see any other mentions of the GEOCONTROL software's test period duration on subsequent pages. The context provided doesn't specify the length of the test period beyond mentioning that it's free and leads to purchasing a licence after expiry.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the duration in the given context, I should respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe duration of the free 'test period' for the 'GEOCONTROL software' user licence is not specified in the provided context. \n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll search for keywords related to the question: \"valve set\" and \"hopper empty sensor.\" \n\nLooking at page 148, there's a mention of the hopper empty sensor being equipped with an alarm that goes off when the hopper is almost empty. It also says that the sensor usually comes with the valve set. So, the valve set is part of the hopper empty sensor.\n\nNow, I need to find out what type of valves are used in this setup. On page 140, there's a section about replacing the agitator axle seal, but nothing directly about the valve type. \n\nMoving on, page 141 discusses replacing the agitator axle seal and mentions that the machine is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent granule loss. However, this doesn't specify the valves.\n\nLooking at pages 142-160, which cover accessories, I see references to various parts like IsoMatch control boxes, cables, and other components, but nothing about valves specifically.\n\nSince there's no direct mention of valve types or manufacturers in the context provided, I can't extract specific information. Therefore, based on the instructions, if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information about the type and manufacturer of the valve used in the 'valve set' that comes with the hopper empty sensor.\n\n**Answer:** Unknown",

Let me start by carefully reading through the context to find any relevant information.\n\nLooking at the pages, I see that page 149 mentions a \"Calibration container\" and a \"Drain kit\". The drain kit is described as being available for quickly emptying the hopper. However, there's no specific mention of the drain rate or how much it can drain per minute.\n\nI'll check other pages related to maintenance and accessories. Page 150 talks about 'Hopper extensions' and 'Hopper cover', but nothing about draining rates. Similarly, page 151 mentions 'Parking wheels set' and 'Mud guards', which aren't relevant here.\n\nLooking through the troubleshooting section on page 152 and onwards, I don't see any information about drain rates or how the drain kit functions in terms of flow rate. The same applies to pages discussing accessories beyond the drain kit.\n\nSince there's no specific data provided about the drain rate, I can't extract an exact number from the context. Therefore, based on the given information, the drain rate isn't specified.\n</think>\n\nThe drain rate for the 'drain kit' is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. \n\nAnswer: Unknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what sail material is used for the hopper cover and its UV resistance based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 150, there's a section about hopper covers. It mentions that the hopper cover protects the fertilizer against humidity and dirt. Then it says, \"The sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening.\" Hmm, so it refers to a 'sail' material, which is used for the hopper cover.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's any information about UV resistance. Scanning through the pages, on page 150 again, it says, \"The electric hopper cover protects the fertilizer in the hopper against humidity and dirt.\" Wait, that's about the electric version. But earlier, it mentioned the sail material being used for the hopper cover.\n\nI don't see any specific mention of UV resistance directly. The context talks about protection against humidity and dirt but doesn't explicitly state how well it handles UV exposure. So, I might not have enough information to confirm the UV resistance properties.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should include that the sail material is used for the hopper cover, as mentioned on page 150. However, since there's no explicit info about UV resistance, I can't provide details on that aspect.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper cover uses a sail material, though specific UV resistance properties are not detailed in the provided context.\n\n**Answer:** The hopper cover is made of a sail material, but its UV resistance details are not specified.",
