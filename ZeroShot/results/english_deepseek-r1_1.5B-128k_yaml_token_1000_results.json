Scanning through each page, I see several sections about the machine and its functions. \n\nOn page 29, there's a section about getting familiar with the machine. It mentions \"ExactLine\" which is used to spread the border. The text says ExactLine bends the fertiliser granules to limit loss over the edge and provides a full spreading pattern. It also talks about 'environment' and 'yield' settings.\n\nOn page 30, there's another section about ISO control system with ISOBUS communication. This part discusses how the spreader uses weighcells for continuous measurement of fertilizer quantity. The computer compares these values to the set application rate and adjusts dosing units based on driving speed and localization data from sensors.\n\nPage 31 has a section about flowrate, which is kg/min, but it doesn't mention any system measuring quantity. It also talks about an automatic calibration test with a test tube.\n\nSo, focusing on what's relevant to the question: The ISO control system uses weighcells to continuously measure fertilizer quantity. That seems to be the key point here. \n\nI should make sure there are no other mentions of similar systems elsewhere in the context. From pages 29 and 30, ExactLine is mentioned for spreading but not for measurement. The ISO system specifically measures weight, which fits the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"ISO control system\" as it's the one that continuously measures fertilizer quantity.\n</think>\n\nThe ISO control system continuously measures fertilizer quantity using weighcells.\n\n[ISO control system]",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the context is about a machine equipped with a reference sensor and a tractor with an ISO control box. There are several sections discussing different aspects like getting familiar with the machine, conversion to ISO tractor, and so on.\n\nLooking for information related to transmission of driving speed. I notice there's a section titled \"Directly to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection in the tractor cabin\" which mentions page 144. That seems relevant because it talks about connecting the tractor directly to the ISO control box, but wait, that section is about the connection within the tractor cabin, not necessarily transmission from the tractor to IsoMatch.\n\nThen there's a part where it says \"The same applies for the PTO shaft RPM.\" This might be referring to how the PTO sensor can be used without ISOBUS communication. It mentions an extra sensor and refers to the manual that comes with the control box. So, if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, they can use the PTO shaft sensor instead.\n\nAnother point is about using the GPS signal via RS 232 on the control box for GEOCONTROL functionality. But that's more about data transfer rather than speed transmission.\n\nWait, I also see a section where it says \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set.\" This part might be relevant because if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, they can use the Power Cable Set from IsoMatch. It mentions that the driving speed is transmitted via the ISOBUS to IsoMatch, but since the tractor lacks ISOBUS, they need another method.\n\nLooking back at the specific question: How can the tractor's driving speed be transmitted to the IsoMatch if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication? The section about adapting non-ISO tractors with the IsoMatch power cable set seems relevant. It says that even without ISOBUS, you can add the IsoMatch power cable set and connect it appropriately.\n\nSo, putting this together: If the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, they can use the Power Cable Set from IsoMatch to transmit driving speed via the PTO shaft sensor instead of the ISOBUS. This is mentioned in the section where it says \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set.\"\n\nI should make sure there's no other information that might contradict this. The part about using GPS on RS 232 doesn't directly address speed transmission, so I think the main answer is about the PTO shaft sensor and the Power Cable Set.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch by using the PTO shaft sensor with an extra cable set from IsoMatch. This method allows communication without ISOBUS communication.\n\nAnswer: The tractor's driving speed can be transmitted via the PTO shaft sensor, which is part of the Power Cable Set from IsoMatch, even if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication.",

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each section header item to find any mention of a switch. The text starts with \"\u00b7 Check the following by camera in the cabin while working:\" and then lists various items like 'a specific point on the machine', 'the crop', etc. There's also a section about getting familiar with the machine, which includes sections for extra functions and save and read.\n\nLooking at the extra functions section, I see several items: Calculator, Internet browser, Camera screen (Camera is optional), Status bar for time, GPS signal strength and driving direction. Then there are save and read sections with documents, tractor data, field data, etc.\n\nIn the save and read section, there's a paragraph that says \"Always switch off the control box when you leave the tractor.\" That seems important because it mentions switching off the control box, which is part of turning it on or off. The text also includes a button labeled \uf034 (which I assume stands for \"Always\") before the sentence about leaving the tractor.\n\nSo putting that together, the main switch button is probably the one labeled \uf034 in the save and read section. It's mentioned right after the instruction to press it at least once, which suggests it's a toggle switch. The text also says to always turn off when leaving the tractor, indicating it's an on/off switch.\n\nI don't see any other mention of a switch button elsewhere in the context that would be more specific or relevant.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how long the machine should be operated after initial setup or maintenance before checking all the nuts and bolts. Let me go through the context step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided, there are several sections discussing assembly instructions, parts handling, hoisting, and mounting. The question is about operating time before checking nuts and bolts.\n\nI see a section where it mentions \"Before the machine can be used, various parts and supplied accessories must be unpacked and assembled.\" That's under SectionHeaderItem Mounting instructions. It says that before mounting, you clean the surface and place the machine on pieces of packaging or parts to prevent damage during transport.\n\nThen there's another part about using sturdy hoisting equipment and hoisting chains. It mentions hooking up approved slings or chains correctly. If done incorrectly, it could cause the machine to fall, leading to material damage and injury.\n\nAnother section talks about working on a clean surface before mounting. This suggests that after placing the machine, you should clean the area around it. But I don't see anything directly related to operating time here.\n\nLooking further down, there's a part where it says \"Accessories and parts must be correctly mounted.\" It mentions assembling them according to specifications and ensuring they're locked securely. Also, tightening all bolts and nuts after one hour of use is mentioned, but that seems more about maintenance than operational time.\n\nThere's also a section about checking nuts and bolts every hour, which is under SectionHeaderItem Check after use or maintenance. But the question is about how long to operate before re-checking. So maybe it's not about the operating time itself but about when to check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point from the context is that after initial setup and any repairs, you should never check holes by inserting fingers because movement might cause injury. Instead, using a pin is better. But that doesn't directly answer the question about operating time before checking nuts and bolts.\n\nLooking again at the section where it says \"Before the machine can be used, various parts and supplied accessories must be unpacked and assembled.\" It mentions cleaning the surface around the machine to prevent damage during transport. So maybe the correct answer is that you should operate the machine for a certain period after initial setup before checking nuts and bolts.\n\nWait, but in the context provided, I don't see any specific time mentioned. The only mention of operating time is about using sturdy hoisting equipment and ensuring proper hoisting points are used to prevent the machine from falling. That's under SectionHeaderItem Use sturdy hoisting equipment and use hoisting points on the machine.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that you should operate the machine for a certain period, but since it's not specified in the context, maybe the answer is unknown or not found in context. But looking back at the instructions, I think the user expects an answer based on the given context.\n\nWait, actually, in the context, under \"Before first use,\" there are two instances where \"Before first use\" appears as a section header with text before first use. That might be related to initial setup or maintenance. But that's about not using it immediately, so maybe that's not relevant.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try again. The question is: After initial setup and after any maintenance or repairs, how long should the machine be operated before re-checking all nuts and bolts?\n\nLooking through the context, I don't see a specific time mentioned for operating the machine. The closest thing is about hoisting equipment and ensuring proper hoisting points are used to prevent damage. That's under \"Use sturdy hoisting equipment\" and \"Use hoisting points on the machine.\"\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that you should operate the machine for a certain period, but since it's not specified in the context, maybe the answer is unknown or not found in context.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think there's a section about using sturdy hoisting equipment. It says \"Use the hoisting points on the machine to hook up your approved slings or hoisting chains.\" If the machine isn't properly hoisted, it could fall, causing damage and injury. So maybe the answer is that you should operate the machine for a certain period after initial setup before checking nuts and bolts.\n\nBut again, I don't see any specific time mentioned in the context. The only mention of operating time is about using hoisting equipment correctly to prevent falling, which might indirectly relate to preventing damage during operation.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that you should operate the machine for a certain period after initial setup before checking nuts and bolts. But since it's not specified, maybe I need to infer from other parts.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the section where \"Accessories and parts must be correctly mounted\" is mentioned, it says that they must be locked securely. So perhaps you should operate the machine for a certain period after initial setup before checking nuts and bolts.\n\nBut again, no specific time given. Maybe the answer is unknown because there",

So, I can ignore that part unless it's relevant elsewhere, which it doesn't seem to be in this context.\n\nPutting it all together, the key point is on page 47: \"Connect the position sensor in the electronic box on the spreader.\" This tells me exactly where the sensor needs to be connected. The text also mentions the optional extras for calibration, but that's probably extra information and not necessary for answering the question.\n\nSo, the answer should clearly state where the sensor is connected based on page 47.\n</think>\n\nThe position sensor for the hydraulic border spreading plate should be connected in the electronic box of the spreader.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see a section header with \"Dosing setting\" and then some text items. The key points here are about how to set the dosing opening using the fine application kit. It mentions that two dosing openings are closed, so the flow rate should be three times higher for the remaining one. That seems important.\n\nThen there's a paragraph titled \"Calculation.\" It says that as long as the selected application rate or driving speed is on the spreading chart, you can calculate the flowrate using the formula: working width (in meters) multiplied by driving speed (km/h) and then by the application rate (kg per hectare). So it's working width x speed x rate.\n\nWait, but I also see a part that says \"As 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed...\" which implies that if two are closed, you multiply the flowrate by three. But in the calculation formula, it doesn't mention multiplying by three; instead, it uses the application rate directly. Hmm, maybe that's because when two dosing openings are closed, the flow rate is adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo putting this together, the general formula seems to be: Flowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) \u00d7 Driving speed (km/h) \u00d7 Application rate (kg/ha). That makes sense because it's a standard formula for calculating fertilizer application rates based on spreading conditions. The mention of closing dosing openings might affect how you set the application rate, but the actual calculation formula remains as above.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other details that could change this formula. There are no additional factors mentioned beyond width, speed, and rate in the context provided. So I think that's the correct general formula.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer is:\n\nFlowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) \u00d7 Driving speed (km/h) \u00d7 Application rate (kg/ha)\n\nAnswer: [Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

The question is asking about the maximum distance between the hopper rim and the ground when loading manually before needing a platform. \n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a section header item labeled \"Loading method\" with several text items. One of them specifically mentions that if a fixed loading platform is used, the machine must be lifted to a minimum height of 10 cm above the soil. It also states that while filling manually or using large bags, if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground exceeds 1250 mm, a manual platform might not be necessary.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to check again. The text says: \"If the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in paragraph \u00bbTechnical specifications\u00ab on page 36.\" Hmm, that doesn't directly answer the question about the maximum distance before a platform is needed.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, I see another part: \"If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.\" So that's about the distance from the machine to the platform being at most 200 mm.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum distance before needing a platform when loading manually. From the text, it says that if the hopper rim is more than 1250 mm away, you might not need a platform. Wait, no, actually, the text doesn't mention 1250 mm; it's 10 cm or 125 mm? Let me check again.\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. The text says: \"If the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags.\" So that would mean if it's over 1250 mm, you might not need a platform. But the question is about when loading manually, what's the maximum before needing a platform.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read again: \"If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.\" So that's about when using a fixed platform, how close you can get without exceeding 200 mm.\n\nBut the question is asking for the maximum distance before needing a platform when loading manually. From the text, it says if the hopper rim is more than 1250 mm away, you might not need a platform. Wait, but that's about the hopper rim being too far, so maybe the answer is 1250 mm? Or is it 10 cm?\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for the maximum distance before needing a platform when loading manually. From the text, it says that if the hopper rim is more than 1250 mm away, you might not need a platform. So maybe the answer is 1250 mm? Or perhaps 10 cm?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the section header item \"Loading method,\" there's a paragraph about filling manually or with large bags: \"If the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in paragraph \u00bbTechnical specifications\u00ab on page 36.\" So that means if it's over 1250 mm, you might not need a platform.\n\nBut the question is about when loading manually, what's the maximum distance before needing a platform? It seems like the answer would be 1250 mm because beyond that, you don't need a platform. But I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly 1250 mm or just over that.\n\nWait, but in the text, it says \"more than 1250 mm,\" so maybe the maximum distance is 1250 mm? Or perhaps it's 10 cm? Hmm, this is a bit confusing. I think the answer should be 1250 mm because that's the threshold where you might not need a platform.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the text again: \"If the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. The filling height is given in paragraph \u00bbTechnical specifications\u00ab on page 36.\" So that means if it's over 1250 mm, you might not need a platform.

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the tray test section, there's a note that says \"weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test.\" It mentions that the tray test should be performed with dry weather, low humidity, and a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2). So for the tray test itself, the maximum wind speed is 3 m/s.\n\nNow, looking at the actual spreading part, I don't see any specific mention of wind speed limits. The context focuses more on the tray test's conditions and material requirements. There are other sections about testing frequency, spreader placement, etc., but nothing directly related to wind speed for spreading itself.\n\nTherefore, since the question is specifically about the maximum wind speed permissible for both the tray test and actual spreading, I only have information from the tray test section. The actual spreading doesn't provide any details on wind speeds, so it's not applicable here.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3 m/s based solely on the tray test instructions.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum wind speed permissible for the tray test is 3 m/s (wind force of 2).

The text mentions that depending on soil or crop composition, you should spread more or less fertilizer locally. It also talks about the control system allowing over- or underdosis to the left, right, or both sides during spreading and shows all keys on the main screen.\n\nNext, page 106 is about border spreading.

But wait, the question is about two actions. From what I can see, there are multiple steps involved, but maybe the two most critical actions are stopping the spreader immediately and disconnecting the PTO shaft.\n\nWait, no, actually, on page 108, it says \"Stop spreading immediately!\" which is one action.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the grease level required below the filler opening in the spreading disc gearboxes after the machine has stood still. Let me go through the context step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the context, there's a section about applying or adding grease. It mentions that the grease must be added regularly under the coupling shaft profiled tubes. Then, it says that when the machine is standing still for a short time, the level of grease under the filler opening should be 35 mm.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about spreading disc gearboxes. I don't see any mention of spreading discs in the context provided. The context only talks about actuator grease and coupling shaft profiled tubes. So maybe the answer isn't directly there.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user meant spreading discs as part of the actuator system? Or maybe it's a different section. Since the question is about spreading disc gearboxes, I should check if there's any information related to that in the context.\n\nLooking again, under \"Maintenance,\" there's a section about applying or adding grease for coupling shaft profiled tubes. But that doesn't mention spreading discs. So perhaps the answer isn't provided because it's not covered in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to something else. If I have to provide an answer based on what's given, I might say that after standing still, 35 mm is needed for coupling shafts, but since the question is about spreading discs, there's no specific information provided here.\n\nWait, perhaps in another part of the context, under \"Spreading Disc Gearboxes,\" it mentions something. Let me check again. Oh, I see a section where it says: \"There is grease in the gearbox below the spreading discs. The level must be 35 mm when the machine has been standing still for a short time.\" So that's relevant.\n\nSo maybe the answer should mention that after standing still, the grease level is 35 mm below the filler opening. But since the question is about spreading disc gearboxes, perhaps it's better to include both: \"After standing still, the grease level must be 35 mm below the filler opening for coupling shaft profiled tubes and also for spreading disc gearboxes.\"\n\nBut wait, in the context provided, under \"Maintenance,\" there's a section about coupling shafts. So maybe the answer is that after standing still, the grease should be at 35 mm for coupling shafts, but not specifically for spreading discs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to spreading disc gearboxes as part of the actuator system and expects the same level. But without explicit mention in the context, it's a bit unclear.\n\nI think the best approach is to provide the information from the section about coupling shaft profiled tubes, which mentions 35 mm when standing still. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe grease level required below the filler opening for spreading disc gearboxes after the machine has stood still should be 35 mm.\n\nAnswer: The grease level must be 35 mm below the filler opening for coupling shaft profiled tubes and spreading disc gearboxes when the machine is standing still.",

The question is specifically asking for the hopper weight without cover in kg for the model Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225.\n\nLooking at the table under each page number (1875, 2550, 3225), I can see that each has a section labeled 'Without hopper cover' and the weight is listed.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question: \"What is the weight in kg of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900?\" Let me start by looking at the context provided. \n\nThe context has a table with several sections and data points. Each section seems to be about different specifications related to the machine, including things like hopper content, filling level, weight, etc. The question is specifically asking for the weight of a particular model: Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that each row has numbers from 1875 onwards. Each number corresponds to different specifications. For example, in '1875', there's a section labeled \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" with a value of 4895 kg. Similarly, in '2550' and '3225', I see similar numbers like 4895 kg under different sections.\n\nWait, but the question is about Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900. Let me check if there's a row where the section number is 3900. Scanning through the table, I don't see any rows with 3900 as the section number. The closest are 1875, 2550, and 3225.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the weight isn't directly listed in those sections but is inferred from another part of the table or elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe there's a specific entry for Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 that I haven't noticed yet.\n\nLooking again at the table, each section seems to be about different aspects like hopper content, filling level, weight, etc., but not specifically model names. So perhaps the weight is listed under another section or maybe it's a separate entry not covered in this context.\n\nWait, let me check if there are any entries for Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900. Scanning through each row:\n\n- '1875' has \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" as 4895 kg.\n- '2550' also has \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" as 4895 kg.\n- '3225' again lists \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" at 4895 kg.\n\nSo, all these sections have the same value for that particular section. That suggests that regardless of the section number, the content is 4895 kg. But wait, the question is about weight in kg, not content. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nLooking further down, each row has a \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" and another section labeled with numbers like '1', '2', etc., which might correspond to different parts or sections within the machine. But again, these don't seem to be related to weight but rather to other specifications.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each row is a table item with multiple columns. The first column is the section header, and then each subsequent column has data for that section. So, for example, in '1875', there are 20 entries from 0 to 19, each representing different aspects.\n\nBut none of these seem to be about weight but rather about other parameters like hopper content or filling level. Therefore, it's possible that the weight isn't directly listed here and might require information from another part of the context or perhaps an external source not provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to infer the weight based on a different section. But given the data presented, all the entries under \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" are 4895 kg for each section number. So if the question is about Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900, perhaps it's referring to this value.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks for the weight in kg, and all these entries have \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" as 4895 kg. That doesn't seem to be the weight. Maybe I'm missing a section that directly lists the weight.\n\nLooking again at the table, perhaps there's another column or entry that specifies the weight. Scanning through each row:\n\n- '1875' has \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" as 4895 kg.\n- '2550' also has \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" as 4895 kg.\n- '3225' again lists \"Content (grease) of the central gearbox\" at 4895 kg.\n\nSo, all these have the same value.

But looking at other rows, like row 13: Applying or adding grease, it's mentioned as \"4 grease nipples on the PTO shaft\" and \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\". So maybe the frequency is based on the number of grease nipples.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't directly answer the question. The question is about checking and setting the discharge bushing height. From row 7, it's written as \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle\", which might not specify a frequency. So perhaps the frequency isn't provided in this context.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table data, I see that for each row, there are entries like \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle\" with nothing else. So maybe the frequency is implied by the number of grease nipples or something else. But I don't have enough information to determine a specific frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again. The question is about how often the bushing height must be checked and the discharge set. From the context, under row 7, it's \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle\", which might relate to the discharge mechanism. But without a frequency specified in this section, I can't determine the exact interval.\n\nWait, but looking at other rows, like row 13: Applying or adding grease, it mentions 4 grease nipples on the PTO shaft and 2 on both discharge bushings. Maybe that's related to the frequency of checking? But again, not directly about the bushing height.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm stuck here because the frequency isn't provided in this context. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that it's not specified in the given text, so I should respond with \"Unknown\"",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how often the agitator seal should be replaced based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the section about \"Maintenance intervals,\" I see a table that lists various maintenance tasks for the agitator. The columns are labeled from 0 to 23, and each row corresponds to different aspects like inspection, checking bolts, hydraulic system, etc. \n\nThe key column is number 15, which is titled \"Central gearbox.\" Under this, there's a section that says \"spreading discs gearboxes\" with several entries. The numbers in the table under this section are mostly empty except for some where specific grease nipples were mentioned.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I think I might have misread. The central gearbox is part of the spreading discs gearboxes. Each row has a number indicating the type of action. For example, rows 10 and 11 mention \"4 grease nipples on the PTO shaft\" and \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings.\" But none of these entries have an explicit mention of replacing the agitator seal.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check other sections. The table also includes a section titled \"we ekly,\" which is about hourly maintenance tasks, but again, no mention of the agitator seal replacement.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me look at the rows more carefully. There's a row with number 17: \"Add oil.\" That doesn't seem related to the agitator seal. Another row with number 23 mentions \"Replace,\" but that's in the later part of the table. Wait, no, actually, looking back, I think the \"spreading discs gearboxes\" section has a row where it says \"Replace\" under the central gearbox column.\n\nYes, here it is: \n\nUnder \"spreading discs gearboxes,\" there's a row with number 17 that says \"Add oil.\" Wait, no, actually, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me check the exact text:\n\nLooking at the table data, under \"spreading discs gearboxes\" (column 15), rows 10 and 11 are about grease nipples on PTO shaft and discharge bushings. Then row 17 is labeled as \"Add oil,\" but that's not related to the agitator seal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check if any of the other sections mention replacing the agitator seal. The section titled \"we ekly\" has hourly maintenance tasks, and none mention replacing the seal. Similarly, the later part of the table under \"spreading discs gearboxes\" doesn't have a row with \"Replace.\"\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Let me check again. In the \"spreading discs gearboxes\" section, rows 10 to 23 are about grease nipples and other actions. The only mention of replacing is in another part of the table under \"Central gearbox,\" but that's not a separate row.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for any row where \"Replace\" is listed under the central gearbox column. Scanning through, I don't see any row with \"Replace.\" The closest is row 17: \"Add oil,\" which doesn't relate to the agitator seal.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm missing something in the context provided. Let me re-examine the entire table:\n\nLooking at all rows under \"spreading discs gearboxes\" (column 15), none of them mention replacing the agitator seal. The only row that mentions replacing is under another section, but it's not a separate row.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check if any of the other sections have a row with \"Replace.\" For example, in the \"Maintenance intervals\" section, there are rows for various tasks like \"Coupling shafts profiled tubes,\" which is about profiled tubes, but not related to the agitator seal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any of the other sections have a row with \"Replace.\" For example, in the \"spreading discs gearboxes\" section, rows 10 and 11 are about grease nipples on PTO shaft and discharge bushings.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question about the torque required for a M18 hexagon steel bolt with specific quality and friction values. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context is a table that lists various torque specifications for different thread sizes (M5, M6, etc.) under different quality levels (.4.6.0, .8.8.0, .10.9.0) with specific friction values. Each section seems to correspond to a different combination of thread size and quality.\n\nThe question is asking about a M18 hexagon bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction value. Looking at the table, I see that under the \"Torques\" column for each quality level, there are entries like '4', '6', etc., which correspond to different thread sizes. \n\nWait, actually, in the context provided, the table starts with M5 and goes up to M20. Each row is a specific combination of thread size (Mx) and quality (.y.z). The columns under \"Torques\" seem to be for different friction values: 4.6.0, 4.6.0, etc., but I think the main point is that each row has multiple torque numbers corresponding to different friction levels.\n\nBut in the question, it's asking specifically about a M18 hexagon bolt with quality .4.6.0 and friction value 0.13. Looking at the table, under \"M5\" for quality .4.6.0, the torques are listed as 1,7; 2,'3'; etc., up to 10, which is '210'. So M18 isn't in that row. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question mentions a M18 hexagon bolt with quality .4.6.0 and friction 0.13. But looking at the table, under \"M5\" for quality .4.6.0, the torques are listed as 1,7; 2,'3'; etc., but not for M18. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to a specific row where the thread size is M18 and the quality is .4.6.0 with friction 0.13. But in the table provided, under \"M5\" for quality .4.6.0, there are entries like 1:7, which might correspond to different values. Maybe I need to look at all rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about a specific row where the thread size is M18 and the quality is .4.6.0 with friction 0.13. But in the table, under \"M5\" for quality .4.6.0, there are entries like 2: '8', which might be for M8.

The question is asking specifically about a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with A2 quality and 0.2 friction.\n\nLooking at the text, I see that each section has a \"Type\" header. For the M6 section, there's a table titled \"Torques.\"4.6.0,10.\" which lists various torques for different friction values. The question mentions 0.2 friction, so I should look for the row where the friction is set to 0.2.\n\nIn the M6 section, under \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\", there are entries like 0:1,7; 1:3,'8'; and so on up to 10:210. These numbers represent the torque in Nm for each friction value. Since the question specifies 0.2 friction, I need to find where that's listed.\n\nLooking at the data, under \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\", there are entries from 0 to 10 with corresponding torques. The first entry is 0:1,7; which might be a typo because it should probably be 0:1.7 Nm for 0.2 friction.

There's also mention of an external signal triggering this application.\n\nLooking at the sections under \"Getting familiar with the machine,\" there are two main parts: Spreading pattern and Full field spreading pattern. The full field spreading pattern is mentioned to overlap 100%, which suggests that it can cover the entire field effectively, including small ones.\n\nThe question asks if one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens. From the context, I don't see any direct mention of one-sided boundary spreading or trapezium-shaped patterns. However, the full field spreading pattern being 100% overlapping might imply that it can handle small areas well, especially when combined with tools and settings.\n\nI also notice that there's a section about influence of the GEOSPREAD function, which includes one-sided boundary spreading. But this is more detailed than what's needed for the question. The key point is that the full field pattern covers 100%, which suggests it can manage small gardens effectively without issues related to environmental pollution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since the full field pattern works well and doesn't mention any limitations specific to small gardens beyond what's implied by covering the entire area, I think one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens.\n</think>\n\nThe full field spreading pattern covers 100%, suggesting it can manage small gardens effectively.\n\n[Carefully extracted information: The full field spreading pattern overlaps 100%, indicating suitability for small gardens.]",

The first part mentions that the troughs should be positioned horizontally with a spirit level. Then, in another section, it talks about setting the hydraulic border spreading plate and provides some instructions on how to use it.\n\nIn one of the text items under SectionHeaderItem, it says: \"Select a gear that would ensure that you drive at the same speed as with the normal PTO shaft, or reduce the application rate by 25%.\" This part seems to be about controlling the spreader's speed and application rate using either the PTO shaft or a custom gear.\n\nAnother text item under SectionHeaderItem mentions: \"Lower the border spreading plate.\" So it looks like there are options for adjusting the plate, including lowering it. The question is whether this can be done without an external source, which would imply a pneumatically actuated method.\n\nSince the context doesn't explicitly state that the plate can be actuated pneumatically, but mentions using PTO shaft or custom gears, I think the answer might be no. However, sometimes in agricultural equipment, there are pneumonic controls for certain parts to adjust spread rates without external inputs. But based on the given information, it seems more likely that the plate is controlled via a PTO shaft rather than being actuated by a manual source.\n\nSo, putting this together, I believe the answer is no because the instructions don't mention a pneumonic actuation method for the plate.\n</think>\n\nThe hydraulic border spreading plate cannot be actuated pneumatically based on the provided context.",

The text mentions that when one-sided boundary spreading is done, you drive along the field edge and spread from the border inward. It also talks about using different functions and accessories like the hydraulic border spreading plate or ExactLine. \n\nWait, so on page 106, it specifically says \"one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate.\" That's a key point. So that part is clear: one side of the field edge is spread using the hydraulic border spreading plate.\n\nNow, looking at page 107, which is about one-sided boundary spreading without the plate. It explains how to use it by driving along the edge and sending granules with the plate. The working width can be adjusted by changing the plate. There are directions for less or more spread, affecting cover quality and loss over the edge.\n\nBut the question is about seven-sided boundary spreading specifically using the hydraulic border spreading plate. So I need to focus on that part of page 106.

But since the question asks for \"specific paint,\" maybe it's referring to a particular brand or standard.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other parts of the context, I see a section header with \"TIP When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers.\" It mentions that you shouldn't use high-pressure cleaning on certain parts. But again, no paint details here.\n\nWait, maybe in the text there's an indication about the type of paint used for protection against corrosion or to prevent damage. The paragraph says \"lubricate and oil all items once again for conservation,\" which might imply that any type of protective coating is used, but perhaps specifically a type like silicone-based or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer refers to using a specific brand's paint as per maintenance instructions. But without explicit information on colors, I can't be certain. However, since the question asks for \"specific paint,\" and given that the context doesn't specify any particular color, perhaps the answer is that no specific paint is required beyond what's mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nWait, but looking back at the text, it says to grease and oil everything once again for conservation. So maybe the answer is that any type of protective coating used during cleaning should be applied, which might include a specific brand or color. But without explicit information on colors, I can't pinpoint it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer refers to using a specific type of paint as per maintenance guidelines, but since the context doesn't provide that detail, I'm unsure. Maybe the answer is that no specific paint is needed beyond what's mentioned in the paragraph, or that any protective coating used during cleaning should be applied.\n\nWait, but looking at the text again, it says \"lubricate and oil all items once again for conservation.\" That might suggest using a type of paint as part of the maintenance process. However, without specific instructions on what kind of paint to use, I can't give an exact color or brand name.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that any type of protective coating used during cleaning should be applied, but since the question asks for \"specific paint,\" maybe it's implied that a particular brand is recommended. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that no specific paint is needed beyond what's mentioned in the paragraph, as the instructions don't specify colors.\n\nWait, but looking at the context again, I see a section with \"120\" which might be related to numbers or codes, not directly relevant here. So, putting it all together, since the question asks for specific paint and the context doesn't provide any color details beyond what's mentioned in the paragraph, perhaps the answer is that no specific paint is required beyond the protective measures mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer refers to using a specific brand of paint as per maintenance instructions. But without explicit information on colors or brands, I can't be precise. Therefore, the best approach is to state that any type of protective coating used during cleaning should be applied, but since the question asks for \"specific paint,\" perhaps it's implied that no specific color is needed beyond what's mentioned.\n\nWait, but looking back at the context, under \"Preparation for winter storage,\" there's a paragraph that says: \"It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.\" So, the key here is that after cleaning, they use grease to prevent damage.\n\nBut the question is about specific paint. Since there's no mention of colors in this context, perhaps the answer is that any type of",

It seems like there's a section that lists what the manual is intended for. The manual is meant for agrarians who are trained in working with agricultural machinery and have the necessary skills from national legislation. There's also mention of knowledge of assembly activities.\n\nLooking at the structure, each item under \"SectionHeaderItem\" seems to be either a section or an item that provides information about the manual. For example, there's a section titled \"For your safety,\" which includes a paragraph on ensuring safety before using or assembling the implement. There are also sections like \"Make sure this manual is available to all workers who will work with this machine\" and others related to employer training.\n\nThe key part here is that the manual is designed for agrarians who are trained in working in agriculture, competent to operate machines required by national legislation, and have knowledge of assembly activities. The section titled \"Target group of this manual\" mentions these points clearly: \"agricarians and others trained in working in the field of agriculture, people that are competent to operate these machine, as required by national legislation, and who have knowledge of assembly activities.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, the curriculum needed is specifically for agrarians who meet those training criteria. The answer should be concise and directly address the question without adding extra information from other sections.\n\nI think I've got it. The main points are about the target group, which includes agrarians trained in agriculture, operating machinery as per national laws, and having knowledge of assembly activities.\n</think>\n\nThe curriculum for competence to operate the machine is designed for agrarians trained in agricultural work, operating machinery as required by national legislation, and having knowledge of assembly activities.",

One of those symbols is an arrow pointing to a part of the text. The description says, \"An arrow refers to a different place in the text.\" So, it's referring to an arrow symbol in the pictogram.\n\nLooking further down, there are warnings about operating malfunctions caused by not complying with safety instructions. These are labeled as 'Warning triangle' and mention serious issues like malfunctioning machines or damage. Then, under 'Spanner', they provide tips for assembly or adjustment work.\n\nNow, I need to find where the pictograms specify an international standard. The section header is \"For the employer\" which lists several points about training personnel and responsible for safe operation. Under that, there's a paragraph starting with \"5.\" It says, \"5. All directional rotations are to be interpreted when facing in direction of travel.\"\n\nWait, but I'm looking for an international standard. The context doesn't mention any specific standards here. Maybe the pictograms themselves don't specify a standard, so perhaps the answer is that no standard is specified by the pictograms.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The user's question is about which international standard the pictograms are specified for. In the provided context, I don't see any mention of an international standard being used in the pictograms. They just describe symbols and their meanings without referencing any standards.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that no specific international standard is mentioned by the pictograms in this manual. Or maybe it's implied that agricultural machinery training follows certain standards, but the context doesn't specify which ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each part again. The 'Meaning of symbols' section mentions an arrow symbol and a warning triangle. There's no mention of any standard here. So, perhaps the pictograms don't specify an international standard in this manual.\n\nWait, but the user is asking about which international standard the pictograms are specified for agricultural machinery.

The advice is to spread the field first before spreading the borders because the control system can then determine the correct dosing setting.\n\nLooking at page 107, there are section headers about one-sided boundary spreading with different tools like the hydraulic border spreading plate and ExactLine.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what screwdriver type\u2014flathead or Phillips\u2014is better for adjusting the dosing mechanism. Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context to find any mentions of screwdrivers related to adjusting mechanisms. Scrolling down, I see several sections about maintenance and safety, but nothing directly about screwdrivers. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the context includes specific instructions or procedures. Let me look for keywords like \"screwdriver,\" \"adjusting,\" \"dosing mechanism.\" Oh, I don't see any mention of a screwdriver here. That makes it tricky because the question is about a tool used in adjusting the dosing mechanism.\n\nI remember that flathead screwdrivers are commonly used for making precise cuts or adjustments, especially when dealing with materials like screws and bolts. They're sharp enough to make accurate measurements without causing damage. On the other hand, Phillips screwdrivers are known for their precision and are often used in tight spaces because of their pointed tips.\n\nSince the question is about adjusting a dosing mechanism, which likely involves making precise adjustments, both types could be suitable. However, I'm not sure if there's any specific information in the context that indicates one type over the other. The context doesn't mention either tool being used for this purpose, so it's hard to determine which one is more optimal.\n\nI might need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge. Flathead screwdrivers are often preferred for their versatility and precision, especially when dealing with materials like screws that require tight fitting. Phillips screwdrivers, while precise, can sometimes be used in situations where flathead isn't the best fit due to space constraints or material type.\n\nBut without specific information from the context, I can't definitively say which one is optimal. Maybe the answer should state that both types are suitable but recommend considering factors like material and space when choosing.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks about a screwdriver for adjusting the dosing mechanism. The context doesn't provide direct information on using either flathead or Phillips screwdrivers, so it's unclear which is more appropriate. Both tools can be used, but their suitability depends on factors like material and space.\n\nAnswer: Both flathead and Phillips screwdrivers are suitable for this purpose, but their choice may depend on the specific application due to differences in material type and available space.",

They provided a context about a tractor's dosing system and a specific question about the 'small crack of light' dimension in millimeters between 'dosing baffles'. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the context carefully. The section talks about setting the dosing baffles, mentioning that if they're not in the correct positions, it causes issues with fertilizer application. It also describes a scenario where the actuator attachment point is moved to create a small crack between the dosing plates.\n\nLooking at the text, there's a paragraph explaining that when the dosing openings don't close well, you lose fertilizer and have higher application rates. Then, it says if the baffles slide far apart, the rate is lower. There's an image mentioned with a small light crack between the plates.\n\nThe question is about the dimension of this crack in millimeters. The context doesn't provide specific measurements, but it does mention that moving the attachment point creates a crack.

The question is specifically about a valve set that includes a hopper empty sensor. \n\nLooking at page 147, there's a section header for Accessories with a paragraph titled \"Intermediate frame.\" Inside that, it mentions the set of vanes for large working widths. But I'm not sure if that's related to the valve set.\n\nMoving on to page 148, another section about Accessories has an exactLine item. The text there says ExactLine is an accurate border spreading tool for boundary track spreading from the last sprayer tramline. It also mentions a calibration test and provides details about the hopper empty sensor. \n\nThe question asks about a valve set that comes with a hopper empty sensor. From page 148, I see that ExactLine includes a hopper empty sensor. The text says it's equipped with an alarm when the hopper is almost empty. So, the valve set in question must be related to ExactLine.\n\nNow, looking at the description of ExactLine: It provides a very good border spreading pattern with optimal balance between profit and environment. However, I don't see any mention of valves or their types here. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something earlier. On page 147, under \"Intermediate frame,\" it mentions the set of vanes for large working widths. But that's about vane placement, not a valve set.\n\nSo, perhaps ExactLine is the valve set they're referring to.
