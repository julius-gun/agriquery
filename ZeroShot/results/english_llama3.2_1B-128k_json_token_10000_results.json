In contrast, inland areas with limited access to water may have higher levels of corrosion.\n\nThis can be attributed to the difference in humidity and temperature conditions between the two environments. Coastal regions tend to have more frequent rainfall and high temperatures, which contribute to moisture accumulation on surfaces, while inland areas have less precipitation and lower temperatures, resulting in reduced exposure to moisture.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended to take extra precautions when working with tractors in coastal regions due to increased risk of corrosion.",
