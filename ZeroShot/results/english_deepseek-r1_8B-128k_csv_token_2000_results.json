Under this, it mentions that when using the fine application setting, two of the three dosing openings are closed. This is to allow for precise dosing and to prevent blockages. \n\nSo, the key point here is that during fine application, two dosing openings are closed out of the total three available. That makes sense because closing two allows for a wider opening in one, which helps maintain a consistent flow even at lower application rates without clogging.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the context. The other sections talk about the number of actuators and how they control the dosing plates, but that's more about the mechanism rather than the specific number closed during fine application.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be two dosing openings are closed.\n</think>\n\nTwo dosing openings are closed during fine application.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg per minute based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 68, there's a section about \"Calculation\" and some specific instructions. One of the TextItems says: \"flowrate required (kg/min) =\", which seems like it's part of a formula. Then another TextItem explains that the flowrate can be calculated using the formula: Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha). \n\nWait, but in the context, there's also mention of adjusting for the number of dosing openings. On page 67, it says that if two out of three dosing openings are closed, the flowrate needs to be three times as much to maintain an even application. So, does this affect the formula?\n\nHmm, so maybe the formula is adjusted by considering the number of open dosing holes. If there are 3 open holes, the flowrate would be as calculated. But if fewer are open, like 1 or 2, then the flowrate needs to be scaled accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together, the basic formula seems to be: flowrate (kg/min) = working width (m) x driving speed (km/h) x application rate (kg/ha). However, if the number of dosing openings is less than three, you might need to multiply by a factor based on how many are open. For example, with 1 open hole, it would be multiplied by 3, as mentioned in page 67.\n\nBut wait, in page 68, it specifically mentions that when using the fine application kit at lower rates, the flowrate is calculated differently. It says to use 3 open holes for standard dosing and 1 open hole plus 2 thick holes for fine application. So maybe the formula already accounts for this by adjusting the number of dosing openings.\n\nI think the key part is that the formula provided in page 68 is: flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha). That seems to be the direct formula given. The mention of adjusting for dosing openings might be a separate consideration, but the question is about the general formula, so I should focus on that.\n\nSo, the exact formula from the context is: flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha). That's what needs to be extracted.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is:\n\nflowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) \u00d7 Driving speed (km/h) \u00d7 Application rate (kg/ha)\n\n**Answer:**  \nflowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) \u00d7 Driving speed (km/h) \u00d7 Application rate (kg/ha)",

It says that the control system switches off the automatic calibration. This makes sense because with less than 100 kg, the measurement accuracy would drop, and new automatic calibration wouldn't improve the discharge curve.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other details related to this specific situation. The context mentions that at low doses (less than 50 kg/ha), it's possible to reduce the minimum hopper capacity for automatic calibration by 15 kg. However, this is more about adjusting settings rather than what happens when it falls below 100 kg.\n\nSo, focusing on the exact question: when hopper content is below 100 kg, the control system turns off the automatic calibration. The measurement accuracy decreases, and new calibration can't improve the discharge curve. This leads to potential issues with crop damage because the application might not be accurate.\n\nI need to provide a precise answer without adding extra information. So, the key point is that automatic calibration is switched off when hopper content drops below 100 kg.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration.

So, for the 3900 model, I need to find its weight.\n\nI see that row 5 is \"Fertiliser application rate (kg/min)\" and row 6 is \"PTO shaft (rpm)\". Then there's row 18 which mentions \"Grease for gear boxes\" as EP 00/000. But I'm looking for the weight, so I need to find the right column.\n\nWait, maybe the first set of numbers after \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" are the weights. So, the first number is 1875 kg, then 2550, 3225, and finally 3900 kg. That must be the weight for the 3900 model.\n\nSo, the weight is 3900 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 is **3900 kg**.",

The relevant one here is line 5: \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + Ex- a...\" but it seems incomplete. Wait, maybe I misread it.

But then I see line 4: \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) (dB)\" with values 73.8 and 84.6.\n\nWait, the question is about Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with rear window opened. So looking at page 37's table, line 4 corresponds to that exact scenario. The dB value there is 73.8 for one model and 84.6 for another. Since the context doesn't specify which model exactly, but the question refers to Kali 60, I think it's safe to take the first number, 73.8, as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe sound level of a Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with its rear window opened is **73.8 dB**.\n\nAnswer:  \n73.8 dB",

        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque (Nm) = Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Thread Class \u00d7 Diameter or Size of the Bolt. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Maybe it's better to look at the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, on page 129 and 130, there are tables that list torques for different materials and thread sizes. The question mentions an M18 bolt, which is a standard SAE classification for bolts. The quality is 10.9, which I think refers to the strength class of the bolt.\n\nThe friction coefficient given is 0.13. From the context, it seems that this higher value applies when the threads are dry. So, if the bolt is oiled, the coefficient would be 0.10, but since it's specified as 0.13, I should use that.\n\nNow, looking at the tables on pages 129 and 130, they have different materials like M5, M6, up to M24. Since we're dealing with an M18 bolt, I need to find the row in the table that corresponds to M18. \n\nOn page 129, under \"Steel tightening torques,\" there's a table where each row represents a material grade. The columns are for different torque values. For example, M5 has 3.6, 5.7, etc. I need to find the M18 row.\n\nLooking at page 130, which is about stainless steel, but the question is about steel bolts, so maybe I should focus on page 129. Wait, no, both pages have similar tables but for different materials. The first table on page 129 seems to be for regular steel, while page 130 is for stainless steel.\n\nWait, in the context provided, on page 129, there's a table with M5 to M24, and each has multiple torque values. The question specifies an M18 bolt, so I need to find the M18 row in that table.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table: it starts with \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques...\" and then lists materials from M5 to M24. Each material has two sets of numbers, probably for different torque levels or under different conditions.\n\nIn the context, on page 129, the table is structured as:\n\n0                         M5               1,7                 2                 5                 6                  7                  8                  9                 10\n1                         M6                 3                 4                 9                10                 13                 15                 15                 18\n...\n10                       M24               210               250               600               710                860               1020               1000               1180\n\nEach row corresponds to a material grade, and the numbers after are likely torque values. The first number seems to be for a lower torque, and the second for higher.\n\nFor M18, looking at page 129's table, I see:\n\n7                        M18                90               110               250               290                350                420                410                490\n\nSo, M18 has values: 90, 110, 250, 290, 350, 420, 410, 490.\n\nBut wait, the question is about a 10.9 quality bolt. I'm not entirely sure how that fits in. Maybe \"10.9\" refers to the strength class, which would affect the torque required. However, in the tables provided, it seems like they are listing torques based on materials and friction coefficients, not necessarily the strength class.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 10.9 refers to the grade of the bolt, indicating a higher strength, so a higher torque is needed. But looking at the table, M18 has maximum torques up to 490 Nm. However, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nWait, in the context on page 129, there's a note: \"* The friction coefficient of 0.10 applies to oiled sheets, cast iron, hardened surfaces, greased threads, etc. The higher value of 0.13 applies to dry sheets.\" So, since the question specifies 0.13 friction, it's for dry conditions.\n\nLooking back at the table on page 129, M18 has two numbers: 90 and 110. But I'm not sure which corresponds to which condition. Maybe the first number is for lower torque and the second for higher? Or perhaps they are for different types of connections.\n\nWait, in the context, there's a line that says \"Torques for bolts and nuts with serrated lower edges 10% extra, such as",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque = Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Force \u00d7 Diameter. But wait, in this context, it's probably referring to the standard torque values provided in tables, which might already account for some factors like material and friction.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are two tables on pages 129 and 130. The first table (page 129) seems to be for general materials like M5 to M24 bolts with different qualities. The second table (page 130) specifically mentions \"70 (A2)\" which likely refers to a specific grade or quality level.\n\nOn page 130, the table starts with columns for M5 to M24 and rows for different qualities: 70 (A2), 80 (A4). The numbers under each combination are probably the torque values in Nm. Since the question is about an M6 bolt with a 0.2 friction coefficient, I need to find the corresponding row for 70 (A2) quality and then locate the M6 column.\n\nLooking at the table on page 130:\n- The first data point under 70 (A2) is 5.7 Nm.\n- Then it goes up by 0.10 increments: 5.7, 9.4, etc., but I think each row represents a specific torque value for that quality.\n\nWait, no, the table seems to have multiple columns for different torque values under each material and quality combination. For example, under M6 and 70 (A2), the first number is 5.7 Nm, then 9.4, etc. But I'm not entirely sure if these are incremental steps or separate torque values.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a different torque value for that material and quality. So for M6 and 70 (A2), the first torque is 5.7 Nm, then 9.4 Nm, up to 16.3 Nm. But I'm not sure if these are all applicable or if there's a specific one.\n\nWait, maybe each row represents a different grade within that quality. For example, 70 (A2) might have multiple grades like A1, A2, etc., but in this case, it's specifically 70 (A2). So the first number under M6 and 70 (A2) is 5.7 Nm.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the context mentions that the friction coefficient of 0.10 applies to oiled sheets, cast iron, etc., but in this case, it's specified as 0.2. So maybe the torque value already accounts for that coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table provides standard torques without considering the friction coefficient, and I need to apply the 0.2 factor myself. But since the question mentions a 0.2 friction, I should consider if that affects the torque.\n\nWait, in the context, it says: \"* The friction coefficient of 0.10 applies to oiled sheets, cast iron, hardened surfaces, greased threads, etc. The higher value of 0.30 applies to dry sheets.\" But the question specifies a 0.2 friction, which isn't mentioned here. Maybe it's an error or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table on page 130 is for stainless steel, and the 70 (A2) refers to a specific grade where the torque is 5.7 Nm for M6. So despite the 0.2 friction, the standard torque is 5.7 Nm.\n\nI think I need to go with the table data provided. On page 130, under M6 and 70 (A2), the first value is 5.7 Nm. Therefore, the required torque is 5.7 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque for fastening an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient is **5.7 Nm**.\n\nAnswer: 5.7",

The text also says that you can drive along the field edge with a half spreading pattern filled to 100% using the border spreading plate and one closed dosing unit.\n\nNow, considering small gardens, I think about the size constraints. If the garden is small, maybe the spreader's capacity or the application rate could be an issue. However, the context doesn't mention any limitations based on garden size specifically. It focuses more on how the ExactLine system allows for boundary spreading without excessive loss.\n\nI also notice that there's a mention of optimizing the spreading pattern to reduce environmental impact, which is important for all sizes, including small gardens. The context doesn't provide information against using one-sided boundary spreading in smaller areas, so I can infer it's possible as long as the equipment supports it.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, one-sided boundary spreading seems suitable for small gardens because the system allows for controlled spreading up to the borders without significant loss.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens.

The question is specifically about spreading without the GEOCONTROL headland, so I should focus on that part.\n\nOn page 103, under \"Spreading without GEOCONTROL headland,\" there's a list of steps. The third step says to let the spreading discs turn and not switch off the PTO shaft. This implies that the discs are still operating even after stopping the spread, which would mean they're moving but not applying any fertilizer.\n\nSince the discs are turning, it suggests that the fertilizer is being circulated within the system but isn't being released onto the field. Therefore, without the headland control, the machine stops spreading before the end of the field, and the discs continue to turn, indicating that the fertilizer might be recirculating or moving through the system.\n\nHowever, the context doesn't explicitly mention the height at which the fertilizer flies in this scenario. It only describes the actions taken when not using the headland, such as stopping the dosing units and keeping the discs turning without shutting off the PTO shaft.\n\nSince there's no direct information about the flight height of the fertilizer when spreading without GEOCONTROL, I can't extract a specific number from the context.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at page 105, there's a section about over and underdosing. It mentions that when using one-sided over- or underdosing, the spreading patterns overlap, especially in narrow working widths. This affects the actual application rate because the overlapping areas might not be covered correctly. It also says that to distribute an adjusted application rate, you must over- or underdose on both the first and second passes.\n\nMoving to page 106, which is about border spreading, it explains that when one-sided boundary spreading, you drive along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. The control system doesn't automatically adjust during this process, so the application rate might deviate. It's advised to spread the main field first before the borders to ensure accurate dosing settings.\n\nOn page 107, under \"One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate,\" it discusses how the working width can be adjusted using the hydraulic plate. The text mentions that during border spreading, you can either spread less or more to the edge. Spreading less reduces loss but affects cover, while spreading more improves cover but increases loss. It also states that the maximum acceptable loss is up to 10% of the total distribution.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage to compensate for application rate during border spreading. The context doesn't explicitly mention speed adjustments. Instead, it talks about adjusting the amount spread (more or less) and using a hydraulic plate to manage working width. There's no direct information on reducing speed as a method to compensate.\n\nSince there's no specific data on speed reduction percentages in the context provided, I should respond that this information isn't found.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. \n\nAnswer: Unknown",

It mentions that before storing, you should lubricate, clean, and then lubricate again. This helps prevent dirt and moisture from getting into bearings and other parts. After cleaning, they grease and oil everything again to conserve.\n\nThen, looking at page 122, it talks about maintenance and repair. It says to place the tractor on a firm surface, switch off the PTO shaft, release hydraulic pressure, and engage the parking brake. Also, it advises checking for any damage or wear from winter storage.\n\nWait, but the question is about preparing for work in the spring, not just storing for winter. So maybe some of these steps are related. The context mentions that after cleaning and lubrication, you should also check the machine right after work to ensure everything's functioning properly. That makes sense because you want to make sure there are no issues before starting again.\n\nSo putting it together, beyond cleaning and lubrication, you should inspect for any damage or wear, check fluid levels, maybe test operations, and ensure all systems are ready. The context doesn't specify exactly what tests or checks, but it does mention additional checks right after work, which implies some form of inspection or testing.\n\nI think the key points are: checking for damage, ensuring proper lubrication, inspecting fluid levels, and possibly testing operations to make sure everything works as expected after winter storage.\n</think>\n\nAt the start of the spring season, to prepare the machine for work beyond cleaning and lubrication, you should conduct a thorough inspection for any damage or wear from winter conditions.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 140, there's a section about replacing the agitator axle seal. The text mentions that the agitator axle is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent fertilizer granule loss. It also says the seal must be replaced every season or after 100 operational hours. Additionally, it specifies that only a clean machine with an empty hopper should be worked on.\n\nNow, the question specifically asks for the material specification of the plastic seal. The context doesn't provide any details about the type of plastic used, such as UHMW or PTFE. It only mentions that it's a plastic seal without giving further specifics. Therefore, I don't have enough information to determine the exact material.\n\nI should check if there are any other parts of the context that might mention the material. Scanning through the other pages and sections, I see references to adjusting the dosing mechanism and safety precautions but nothing about the material properties of the seal.\n\nSince the question asks for the specification, which would typically include details like grade or type, and those aren't provided here, I can only conclude that this information isn't available in the given context. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe plastic seal's material specification isn't detailed in the provided context.\n\n**Answer:** Not found in context",

One of them mentions \"Metal seal ring\" with an image and additional info. The next item is \"\\uf034 Remove the metal seal rings.\" So, it seems like these are parts that need to be taken off.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the material of these metal seal rings. I don't see any direct mention of the material itself in the context provided. There's a mention of \"metal seal ring\" as an item to remove, but no information on whether it's made of a specific type of metal like stainless steel or another material.\n\nI should check if there's any other part that might specify the material. On page 140, there's a section about replacing the agitator axle seal and mentions a plastic seal. But that's for the plastic part, not the metal one. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide details on the specific material of the metal seal rings beyond referring to them as \"metal,\" I can't extract any more precise information. Therefore, based on the given data, the answer should be \"Not found in context\" because there's no explicit mention of the material beyond it being metal.\n</think>\n\nThe material of the 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal is not explicitly stated in the provided context.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 144, there's a section about \"Extended ISO cable\". The text says that an extended ISO cable is available for a tractor-trailed spreader. It mentions replacing the short cable already fitted and to exchange the whole cable. \n\nI'm trying to find the length of this extension cable. The context doesn't specify the exact measurement, but it does mention that it's an extended version. Since it's meant to replace the existing short cable, I can infer that it's longer than the standard one. However, without a specific number, I can't provide an exact length.\n\nI should check if there's any other part of the context that might have this information. The section about \"IM Tellus sensor input\" talks about optional extension cables but doesn't give lengths. Similarly, the RS232 cable section also doesn't specify lengths beyond mentioning it's available.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide a numerical value for the extension cable length, I can't extract an exact number.
