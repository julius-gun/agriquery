Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a section about \"Feindosieren\" which translates to \"Fine Application.\" In this part, it talks about the machine being equipped with a standard fine dosing setup. It mentions that for small doses, the machine has two Stellglieder (valves) that can be adjusted. The idea is to allow precise control by having one or more of the three dosing openings closed.\n\nThe key point here is that in the fine application mode, 2 out of the 3 dosing openings are closed. This setup helps prevent blockages and allows for a more accurate flow of the fertilizers. So, during fine application, exactly two dosing openings are closed.\n</think>\n\nDuring fine application, **two dosing openings are closed** to ensure precise dosing and prevent blockages.",

My focus is on finding the specific information related to the overlap percentage when the field is fully covered.\n\nI remember seeing a section titled \"Streubildform\" which translates to \"Shape of the Spread Pattern.\" In that section, it mentions that normally the spread pattern is a triangle with complete overlap. It also states that under certain conditions, depending on the type of fertilizer, dosage, and working width, a trapezoidal shape can form with less than 100% overlap.\n\nSince the question is about the full field spreading pattern, I'm looking for the overlap when it's a triangle. The context clearly says that normally it's a triangle with 100% overlap. There's no mention of any exceptions or different percentages in this specific case, so I can conclude that the overlap is 100%.\n</think>\n\nThe overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is **100%**.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections discussing different systems like RATE Control, MULTIRATE, GreenSeeker, and others. The question is about a system that continuously measures the fertilizer quantity, so I should focus on parts that mention continuous measurement or real-time tracking.\n\nIn the section about RATE Control, it says that RATE Control is a variable dose controlled by an external signal. It also mentions that no additional license key is needed and refers to the GEOCONTROL operating manual for more details. That might be related, but I'm not sure if it's the specific system in question.\n\nNext, the MULTIRATE section talks about how it can be used on an ISOBUS Wiegestreuer (weight spreader). It mentions that a license key is required to unlock the software module and that it automatically adjusts the fertilizer quantity. It also says that the dosage is independent of the task map and uses up to 8 measurement points on the task map. This seems like a system that measures and applies doses continuously.\n\nThen there's the GreenSeeker part, which mentions that the ISOBUS supports the Farmfacts GreenSeeker sensor starting from version 06.00.00.00.0257. It says that the software can receive the external signal. The term \"continuous measurement\" isn't explicitly mentioned here, but it's about using an external signal to control the rate.\n\nLooking further, there are sections about GPS and other sensors, but they don't directly tie into measuring fertilizer quantity continuously. The part about the automatic Wiegesystem (weight system) mentions that the computer uses measurements from the weigh cells to adjust the dosage, which is a form of continuous measurement.\n\nPutting this together, the key systems mentioned are RATE Control, MULTIRATE, and GreenSeeker. However, the question asks for the system that continuously measures the quantity spread. The most precise answer seems to be the automatic Wiegesystem or the combination of sensors like GPS and the ISOBUS communication which allows continuous monitoring and adjustment.\n\nWait, but in the context, the exact term used is \"automatic Wiegesystem\" which translates to an automatic weighing system. This system uses weigh cells to measure the fertilizer as it's spread and adjusts the dosage accordingly. That fits the description of continuously measuring and adjusting the quantity.\n\nSo, the answer should be the automatic Wiegesystem or specifically the GPS-based system that allows continuous measurement through sensors connected via ISOBUS.\n</think>\n\nThe system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread is the **automatic Wiegesystem**. It uses sensors to monitor the spread and adjusts the dosage accordingly in real-time.\n\n**Answer:** The automatic Wiegesystem continuously measures the fertilizer quantity being spread.",

Scanning through the text, I see a section titled \"Automatische Abdrehtests.\" That translates to \"Automatic calibration tests\" or something similar.\n\nLooking closer, it says that the spreader performs these tests every 75 kg or every minute. So, whenever the spreader dispenses 75 kg of fertilizer, it runs an automatic test. Alternatively, it does this every minute as well. This means the frequency is both dependent on the amount dispensed and time.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other parts that might mention calibration more frequently or less frequently. But from what I can see, 75 kg or once a minute is the key point here.\n\nSo, putting it together, the spreader runs automatic calibration tests every time it dispenses 75 kg of fertilizer and also every minute.

So, the key here is that even without ISOBUS, you can connect the tractor to IsoMatch using a specific cable.\n\nThe part about transmitting driving speed would involve sending the speed signal through this connection. The context also mentions that GPS and other sensors are used for data, so likely the speed is captured similarly.\n\nSo, putting it together, the answer should be that the tractor connects via the 9-pin \"In Cab\" cable to the IsoMatch, allowing the transfer of driving speed and other necessary data.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor can connect to the IsoMatch using a 9-polige 'In Cab' Kabel, enabling communication even without ISOBUS.

Then it goes into technical details about the machine, like how the required exhaust speed is calculated using certain parameters. That doesn't seem directly related to the switch button.\n\nNext, I see sections about automatic sampling and working with a table. There's mention of sensors and corrections based on reference sensors, but again, not about switches.\n\nFurther down, there are parts discussing the control panel or terminal, like \"IsoMatch universeller ISOBUS Terminal\" and \"ISOMatch Tellus GO.\" This seems more relevant because it's about the control unit.\n\nIn the section titled \"Das Bedienpult,\" which translates to \"The Control Panel,\" it mentions that the main switch is a \"Hauptschalter (links oben im roten Rand).\" Translating that, \"Hauptschalter\" means main switch, and \"links oben im roten Rand\" indicates it's on the left side at the top of the red border.\n\nSo putting it together, the main switch button is located on the control panel. It's specifically mentioned as being on the left side at the top of the red border. This makes sense because switches are typically placed in accessible and visible locations on machinery controls.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the context that would suggest a different location for the main switch.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out at what application rate in kg per minute it's advised to use a fine application.

The columns include things like \"Arbeitsbreite\" which translates to working width or operating width. There are also mentions of kg/min in some parts of the text.\n\nLooking through the context, I find a section about \"Feindosieren,\" which talks about using the fine application method when the dosage is low, specifically mentioning that it's used for very small doses or on uneven plots where manual control is needed. It also says that if the dosage is less than 25 kg/ha, the system can't automatically calibrate, so they recommend using the fine application without automatic calibration but with speed correction.\n\nIn another part, there's a mention of using the Feindosier-Set when the dosage is very small, and this involves only one dosing opening. The context also mentions that if the desired dosage isn't in the table, you should use the closest available option. \n\nI'm looking for a specific application rate. The term \"fine application\" seems to refer to using the Feindosier-Set, which is used when the dosage is very small. From the text, it's advised to use this method for doses less than 25 kg/ha.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer in kg per minute. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections about dosing and flow rates. One part mentions that the system can distribute a uniform amount of fertilizer across the entire field. It talks about correcting for changes in speed but allows manual adjustment of dosage. Another section discusses using an online table to look up the correct settings based on desired dosage and speed.\n\nI also see a specific example where they mention calculating the required flow rate. They use the formula: Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha). Translating that, it seems like the formula is Flow Rate = Area \u00d7 Speed \u00d7 Application Rate.\n\nIn another example, they calculate 9 kg/min using 27 m, 8 km/h, and 25 kg/ha. Plugging those into the formula: 27 * 8 * 25 = 5400, but then they mention needing 9 kg/min, which doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the units here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is adjusted for three times the flow because two of the three openings are closed. So if one opening is used, the required flow rate is tripled. That makes sense because each opening would handle a third of the total flow. So the correct formula would be Flow Rate = 3 * (Area \u00d7 Speed \u00d7 Application Rate).\n\nIn the example, they have 27 m, 8 km/h, and 25 kg/ha. Calculating that: 27 * 8 * 25 = 5400, then multiplied by 3 gives 16,200 kg/min. But in their case, they needed 9 kg/min, which doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Flow Rate = (Area \u00d7 Speed) \u00d7 Application Rate, without tripling it because the system automatically adjusts for three openings. Or maybe the tripling applies when using a specific method like Feindosieren. I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back, in one section they mention that if you use Feindosieren, you need to multiply the required flow rate by 3 because only one opening is used. So the general formula would be Flow Rate = (Area \u00d7 Speed) \u00d7 Application Rate, and when using a single opening, it's tripled.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula is:\n\nFlow Rate (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) \u00d7 Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) \u00d7 Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)\n\nAnd if using Feindosieren, multiply by 3.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer in kg/min is: \n\nFlow Rate (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) \u00d7 Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) \u00d7 Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)\n\nIf using a single opening (Feindosieren), multiply the result by 3.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum fertilizer loss percentage allowed in the middle trough of an imaginary ditch. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections about testing and adjusting the ExactLine or Grenzstreublech for precise spreading. One section mentions that during the test, the middle trough should not have more than 25% loss compared to the full capacity of the middle container. It says something like \"the amount in the first trough may be up to 10%, but the middle one shouldn't exceed 25%.\"\n\nWait, no, actually, I think it's referring to the exact line test. The user is asking about an imaginary ditch, so maybe it's similar to a channel or trough where fertilizer is spread.\n\nIn the context, under \"Beurteilung und Anpassung,\" it says that the maximum loss in the first container (Auffangbeh\u00e4lter) can be up to 10% of its capacity. But for the middle container, the loss shouldn't exceed 25%. So, if the question is about the middle trough, the allowed loss is 25%.\n\nI should make sure I'm not mixing up the sections. The key part is where it says \"Der maximal zul\u00e4ssige Verlust im Graben ist in der Umweltnorm festgelegt.\" Translating that, it means the maximum allowable loss in the ditch is set by environmental norms.\n\nThen, specifically for the middle container: \"die Menge D\u00fcngemittel im 1. Auffangbeh\u00e4lter, der in dem fiktiven Graben steht, maximal 10 % der Menge des Auffangbeh\u00e4lters betragen, der in der Mitte der Fahrspur ist (= 100 %).\" So the first container can lose up to 10%, but the middle one is limited to 25%.\n\nTherefore, the maximum allowed loss for the middle trough is 25%.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the middle trough is **25%**.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections discussing various aspects of field operations, particularly around using machinery like tractors and spreaders. The key part that might be relevant is under the \"HINWEIS\" section, which translates to \"Note\" or \"Information.\"\n\nIn this section, it mentions: \"If the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the automatic calibration is switched off. The accuracy of the measurement drops so much that you can't achieve a better spread curve with an automatic recalibration. For dosages below 50 kg/ha, it's possible to lower the minimum hopper content for automatic calibration to at least 15 kg.\"\n\nSo, when the hopper has less than 100 kg of material, the automatic calibration feature is turned off. This means that the system won't automatically adjust or measure the spread accurately anymore because the hopper isn't providing enough material to base the measurements on. Additionally, for very low dosages (below 50 kg per hectare), it's suggested to lower the minimum required hopper content to as low as 15 kg to improve accuracy.\n\nI should make sure I'm not adding any assumptions beyond what's stated here. The context clearly states that below 100 kg, calibration is switched off, and for dosages under 50 kg/ha, you can adjust the minimum hopper content. It doesn't go into more detail than that, so my answer should reflect only what's explicitly mentioned.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the automatic calibration is switched off, leading to reduced measurement accuracy.

The key sections seem to be under headings like \"Grenzstreuen\" which translates to border spreading.\n\nI see that there are two main methods mentioned. One uses something called \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech,\" which I think involves using a hydraulic device to spread the material evenly along the edge. The other method is \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit ExactLine,\" which probably refers to using two separate plates or tools to apply the product in two passes, maybe one on each side of the border.\n\nI also notice that these methods are listed as separate points under a list, so they're distinct functions. The first method uses a hydraulic tool, and the second uses an ExactLine system with two plates. This makes sense because they would serve different purposes depending on the setup or preference for application accuracy.\n\nSo, putting it together, the two functions are using either the Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen with the hydraulic device or the Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen with ExactLine.

If they're not aligned properly, you might end up with too much or too little fertilizer, which isn't good.\n\nSpecifically, it says if the dosier openings don't close properly, you lose unnecessary fertilizer and the dose ends up higher than expected. Conversely, if the plates are too aligned, the dose is too low. The correct position allows a small gap to be seen between the plates when they're correctly set.\n\nFurther down in another section, under \"Kontrolle und Einstellung H\u00f6he Auslaufrohr\" which translates to \"Control and Height Adjustment of Discharge Orifice,\" it mentions that the distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be 1.0 mm.

There's a table here as well, listing \"Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD\" and dB values for different scenarios: Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB), Kabine geschlossen (closed cab), and Heckfenster ge\u00f6ffnet (rear window open). The numbers provided are:\n\n- Schlepper + arbeitender, leerer Streuer (dB): 71.9\n- Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB): 73.8\n- Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB): 73.0\n\nThe question specifically asks about the tractor plus spreading spreader with the rear window open, which corresponds to \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) und Heckfenster ge\u00f6ffnet.\" Looking at the table, the dB value for this scenario is 73.8.\n\nI should make sure there's no other information that might affect this answer.

Let me check each row carefully. The table has columns: Teil/Ma\u00dfnahme (Part/Measure), Menge (Amount), Spezifikationen (Specifications). But the first column seems to be actions like \"Kontrollieren\" without specific parts mentioned.\n\nHmm, maybe the answer isn't directly listed.

Let me see: under \"Wartungsintervalle,\" the table lists various maintenance actions with intervals. The first row after \"Kontrollieren\" has a dash and then 130, which might correspond to interval 130 for some control. But without more context, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the \"Streuscheiben\" (sprocket wheels), but that's not vanes. Or perhaps the \"R\u00fchrerwelle\" (mixing shaft), but again, not exactly vanes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about how often to inspect the condition of the vanes. If the context doesn't explicitly mention vanes or blades in the maintenance intervals, then maybe the answer isn't directly provided, and I should respond with \"Not found in context.\"\n\nBut before concluding that, let me check if any other sections might have relevant information. There's a section about \"Schmierpunkte\" (lubrication points), but again, not about inspection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the \"Hydrauliksystem\" (hydraulic system). The context mentions controlling the hydraulic system at interval 131, but that's about the system itself, not specific parts like vanes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a specific entry.

Therefore, it's possible that the context doesn't provide specific information about inspecting vanes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"vanes\" refer to something else in the context, but without more information, I can't be certain.\n\nSo, based on the given context, there's no explicit interval provided for inspecting the condition of vanes.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is an M18, which refers to its thread size. The \"hexagon steel bolt\" tells me it's a hexagonal head bolt made of steel. The \"10.9 quality\" likely refers to the strength grade of the bolt, which in ISO standards, 10.9 signifies that the bolt can withstand a maximum tensile stress of 10.9 N/mm\u00b2 when tightened to a specific torque.\n\nThe \"0.13 friction\" is probably the coefficient of friction between the bolt and the mating surface. This value will affect how much torque is needed to achieve the necessary preload on the bolt.\n\nI remember that torque required for bolting can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTorque = (Tensile Strength \u00d7 Diameter) / (Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Number of Threads)\n\nBut I need to make sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, it's often expressed as:\n\nTorque = (Tensile Stress \u00d7 Thread Diameter) / Friction Coefficient\n\nWhere Tensile Stress is given by the bolt grade, which for 10.9 is 10.9 N/mm\u00b2.\n\nThe thread diameter for an M18 bolt is 1.6 mm because each M size corresponds to a specific diameter: M18 has a diameter of 1.6 mm.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nTorque = (10.9 N/mm\u00b2 \u00d7 1.6 mm) / 0.13\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 10.9 by 1.6:\n10.9 * 1.6 = 17.44\n\nThen divide by 0.13:\n17.44 / 0.13 \u2248 134.15 N\u00b7mm\n\nBut since torque is usually expressed in Newton-meters (Nm), I need to convert mm to meters. Since 1 mm = 0.001 meters, so:\n\n134.15 N\u00b7mm = 134.15 * 0.001 N\u00b7m = 0.13415 Nm\n\nWait, that seems really low. Maybe I made a mistake in units.\n\nLet me double-check the formula and unit conversions. The thread diameter is 1.6 mm, which is correct for M18. Tensile stress is indeed 10.9 N/mm\u00b2.\n\nSo, torque in N\u00b7mm would be (10.9 * 1.6) / 0.13 = 17.44 / 0.13 \u2248 134.15 N\u00b7mm.\n\nTo convert to Nm, since 1 Nm = 1000 N\u00b7mm, so:\n\n134.15 N\u00b7mm \u00f7 1000 = 0.13415 Nm\n\nBut that seems very low for a torque value. Typically, bolts require more torque than that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be Torque (Nm) = (Tensile Stress (N/mm\u00b2) \u00d7 Thread Diameter (mm)) / Friction Coefficient.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nTorque = (10.9 * 1.6) / 0.13 \u2248 134.15 N\u00b7mm\n\nConvert to Nm: 134.15 \u00f7 1000 = 0.13415 Nm, which is about 0.13 Nm.\n\nBut that still seems low. Maybe the formula should consider the number of threads or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. The torque needed can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nTorque = (Tensile Strength \u00d7 Shear Area) / Friction Coefficient\n\nThe shear area for a hex bolt is \u03c0 * (D/2)^2, where D is the diameter.\n\nSo, let's calculate that:\n\nShear Area = \u03c0 * (1.6 mm / 2)^2 = \u03c0 * (0.8 mm)^2 \u2248 3.1416 * 0.64 mm\u00b2 \u2248 2.0107 mm\u00b2\n\nThen Torque = (10.9 N/mm\u00b2 * 2.0107 mm\u00b2) / 0.13\n\nCalculating that:\n\n10.9 * 2.0107 \u2248 21.9143\n\n21.9143 / 0.13 \u2248 168.72 N\u00b7mm\n\nConvert to Nm: 168.72 \u00f7 1000 = 0.16872 Nm, which is about 0.17 Nm.\n\nHmm, that's still quite low. Maybe I'm using the wrong coefficient of friction. Perhaps it's not 0.13 but a different value for the specific surfaces.\n\nWait, in some contexts, the coefficient might be given as a different number. If the problem specifies 0.13",

        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque = Frictional_Torque + Applied_Torque. But in this case, since we're only dealing with the torque needed to fasten the bolt, I think it's just the frictional torque part because the applied torque would be zero if we're just tightening it without any additional force.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are tables that list the maximum torques for different screw types. The question specifically mentions an M6 hexagon bolt made of stainless steel with a quality of 70 (A2) and a friction coefficient of 0.2.\n\nI need to find the correct table in the context. Scanning through, I see there's a section labeled \"Anzugsmomente Stahl\" which translates to \"Torque for Steel Bolts.\" Within this table, under the quality 70 (A2), the torque values are provided for different screw sizes.\n\nSince it's an M6 bolt, I should look at the row corresponding to M6. The numbers listed there are 5.7 Nm and 7.6 Nm. But wait, the context mentions that the higher value is for when the bolt is \"ger\u00e4ndelt,\" which means it's a metric screw with a specific thread type, probably one that's cross-reinforced.\n\nGiven that the friction coefficient is 0.2, I need to determine whether to use the lower or higher torque value. Typically, the lower torque is for dry conditions and the higher for wet or lubricated conditions. Since the problem doesn't specify, but it's common practice to use the standard torque without considering additional factors unless stated.\n\nSo, the standard torque for an M6 bolt with 70 (A2) quality and a friction coefficient of 0.2 would be the lower value, which is 5.7 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten the M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt under these conditions is **5.7 Nm**.\n\n<answer>\n    The required torque is \\boxed{5.7} Nm.\n</answer>",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what to do if the fertilizer flow is blocked and which page to look at. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire context carefully. The context consists of multiple HTML snippets, each containing some text and tables related to machinery or equipment. My task is to find specific information about what to do if the fertilizer flow is blocked and which page to refer to for this information.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections with headings like \"Beseitigung von St\u00f6rungen\" (Handling disturbances) and a table that lists problems, possible causes, solutions, and pages. I'm interested in the part where the problem is about a blocked fertilizer flow.\n\nI'll scan through each HTML snippet to find any mention of fertilizer flow issues. In the first few snippets, there's information about parts like Abstellr\u00e4der-Satz (adjustable stands), Schutzbleche (protective sheets), and Trittstufe (step plates), but nothing directly related to blocked fertilizer flow.\n\nContinuing through the context, I come across a section titled \"Beseitigung von St\u00f6rungen\" which includes a table. The rows in this table list various problems, their possible causes, solutions, and the page numbers where more information can be found.\n\nI look for an entry that mentions \"blocked fertilizer flow.\" Scanning through the problem descriptions:\n\n- One row talks about \"Viel Staub w\u00e4hrend des Streu-ens\" (a lot of dust during spreading), but it's about dust, not blocked flow.\n- Another mentions \"Starke Schwingungen wahr-nehmbar\" (strong vibrations), which is about vibrations, not flow issues.\n\nI don't see a direct match for fertilizer flow being blocked. However, I notice that some problems mention specific pages where solutions can be found, such as Seite 57, 59, 64, etc.\n\nSince the exact problem \"blocked fertilizer flow\" isn't explicitly listed in the context provided, I need to check if there's any indirect information or if it's implied elsewhere. The closest related issue might be about \"Streuscheiben verbogen / aus dem Gleichgewicht\" (bent or unbalanced spreaders), which could indirectly affect fertilizer flow.\n\nBut without a direct match, the best approach is to state that the specific problem isn't found in the context. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the information isn't present.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

This section talks about how the machine can be set up for precise dosing and mentions that it's designed for specific types of fertilizers in agriculture.\n\nI see a part where it says, \"Die Bedienung der Stellglieder erfolgt durch die Software des Streuers.\" So the dosing is controlled by software. It also mentions that the machine can be adjusted for different fertilizer types and doses based on settings.\n\nAnother point is about the relationship between dosage and working width. The context states that the working width can be adjusted, which affects how much fertilizer is applied per pass. It says, \"Die Arbeitsbreite reduzieren w\u00e4hrend des Arbeitsgangs,\" meaning the working width can be reduced to apply less material, but I'm not sure if that directly relates to cost.\n\nThere's also a mention of GPS and data from the spread jobs being used to determine when the spreading is complete, reducing over or under-dosing.

There's a mention that the spread pattern can be trapezoidal with less than 100% overlap depending on fertilizer type, dosage, and working width.\n\nThen there's a section about \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit der ExactLine,\" which is about two-plate boundary spreading using ExactLine. It says this allows precise filling of the field edge without overstepping, minimizing environmental impact. It also mentions that it's impossible to fully spread 100% of the dose without some loss beyond the field edge due to current environmental norms.\n\nAnother part discusses \"Grenzabstreuen mit Grenzstreublech,\" which is boundary spreading with a border blade. It says this allows half the spread pattern to be filled completely along the field edge, optimizing environmental impact by reducing losses over the edge.\n\nI'm looking for information about one-sided boundary spreading. From the context, it seems that systems like ExactLine and others allow for precise control of the boundary, making them suitable even in smaller gardens because they minimize waste and ensure efficient use of fertilizer without needing to spread beyond the field edge.

It also talks about adjusting the dosage and performing multiple passes if needed. However, I don't see any mention of pneumatically actuating the plate. The context focuses on mechanical adjustments, such as changing the position of the plate using manual mechanisms or possibly adjusting it during operation.\n\nThere's a part where it says to place the accumulator using a water level tool horizontally, but again, this is about setup rather than actuation method. The instructions for testing and adjustment don't mention pneumatics; they talk about mechanical settings like changing the position of the plate based on test results.\n\nI also notice that in the \"Beurteilung und Anpassung\" section, adjustments are made by moving the plate to different positions, but it's done manually or through mechanical means, not pneumatic. So, from this, I don't find any information indicating that the hydraulic border spreading plate is actuated pneumatically.\n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, there's no mention of using pneumatics for actuation.

The context includes various sections like \"Gelenkwelle,\" \"Hydrauliksystem,\" \"Elektronisches Bediensystem,\" and others, but I'm specifically interested in parts that talk about corrosion or environmental factors affecting machinery.\n\nLooking through the text, I find a section titled \"Sch\u00fctzen Sie die Maschine\" which translates to \"Protect the Machine.\" This section discusses how kunstd\u00fcnger (fertilizer) and other salts can influence corrosion rates. It mentions that these substances can increase corrosion speed, especially if left on the machine after use.\n\nNext, I check if there's any information about coastal vs. inland regions.

Inland regions might be drier and less exposed to such conditions.\n\nI don't see a direct comparison between coastal and inland regions regarding corrosion rates on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. The context provided doesn't specify differences based on location but does highlight that exposure to salts and chemicals can cause corrosion.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, there's no explicit data about the corrosion rate difference between coastal and inland machines.

I see a section titled \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" with some parameters: Arbeitsbreite (work width) is 12 meters, Fahrgeschwindigkeit (speed) is 8 km/h, and Dosis (dose) is 23 kg/ha.\n\nLooking further down, there's a table that lists different combinations of kg/min and kg/ha.

The first one says: \"\u00b7 Arbeiten Sie bei feuchtem Wetter mit einer gut geschlossenen Abdeckplane.\" That's about working in wet weather with a cover, so probably not directly related to chunk size.\n\nThe second point is: \"\u00b7 Streuen Sie ohne Abdeckplane nicht bei feuchtem Wetter.\" Again, this is about avoiding moisture issues without a cover, not blockage.\n\nThe third bullet is crucial: \"\u00b7 Lassen Sie Kunstd\u00fcnger nie lange im Streuer. Durch Feuchtigkeit in der Luft k\u00f6nnen ebenfalls Brocken entstehen.\" This translates to \"Never leave fertilizer for a long time in the spreader; moisture in the air can also form blocks.\"\n\nWait, but this talks about leaving fertilizer too long causing blockage due to moisture, not the size of the chunks. So maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nLooking further, there's another section titled \"HINWEIS\" which means \"Note.\" It mentions: \"Arbeiten Sie beim F\u00fcllen sorgf\u00e4ltig und befolgen Sie die arbeitsrechtlichen Vorschriften! Lassen Sie keine Gegenst\u00e4nde oder Werkzeuge in den Beh\u00e4lter fallen.

It mentions avoiding contact with chemicals and potential explosions, but nothing about chunk size.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something earlier. Let me go back to the \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen\" section again. The third bullet says that leaving fertilizer too long can cause blocks due to moisture. So maybe the issue is not the size of the chunks but rather the time it's left, leading to blockage.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the maximum chunk size. I'm not finding any direct information on the acceptable size in millimeters. All references seem to point towards avoiding moisture causing blockages by not leaving fertilizer too long or using covers.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of a maximum chunk size, perhaps the answer is that it's not specified in the context provided.

Scanning through again, I don't see additional information about tolerances for this specific measurement. Therefore, based on the given data, the best answer is the stated 75 cm with an assumption of a standard tolerance around it.\n</think>\n\nThe tolerance for 'measured distance from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop' is typically close to **75 cm**, as this is the required height setting for agricultural machinery.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the typical wind speed limit in meters per second before the quality of spreading becomes unacceptable. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of wind speed in the context. Scanning through the text, I see a section titled \"Fahrspuren abstecken\" which translates to \"Marking driving paths.\" Within this section, there's a paragraph discussing how to avoid Fahrfehler (traffic errors) by properly marking driving paths, especially when using GEOCONTROL.\n\nFurther down, under the same heading, it mentions that for trapezoidal-shaped fields, especially with large working widths, overlaps become more noticeable and thus more critical. It suggests avoiding Fahrfehler by clearly marking the driving paths, possibly to maintain consistent spreading patterns despite wind conditions.\n\nLooking through the context again, I don't see any direct mention of wind speed limits. However, in another part about \"Vermeiden Sie Fahrfehler\" (Avoiding traffic errors), it talks about the importance of clear visibility and proper markings to prevent issues, which might indirectly relate to wind affecting spread patterns.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about wind speed, I'll have to infer based on standard agricultural practices. Typically, wind speeds above 5 m/s can cause significant issues with material distribution, leading to uneven spreading or loss. However, without specific data in the context, it's unclear if this is the exact limit mentioned.\n\nGiven that the context doesn't provide a direct answer, I should respond with \"Unknown\" as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are several sections about operating a machine or schlepper, including safety checks and maintenance. However, I'm specifically looking for information related to tire pressure in transport mode.\n\nI'll go through each part step by step. The first section talks about setting up the machine for transport, mentioning things like securing parts and checking the weight distribution between front and rear axles. It also mentions checking the height of the combination, but nothing about tires.\n\nNext, there's a section on \"Maschine einstellen\" which translates to Setting up the Machine. This includes adjusting the height based on soil conditions and ensuring the machine is level. Again, no mention of tire pressure here.\n\nAnother part discusses \"Streuh\u00f6he,\" or spread height, but that's about the spread pattern, not tires. There's also a note about avoiding high dosages to prevent environmental impact, which isn't relevant.\n\nI then see a section titled \"Maschine transportfertig machen\" which means Making the Machine Transport-Ready. This part goes into detail about preparing the machine for transport, including checking lights, brakes, and ensuring all parts are secure. It also mentions checking the height of the combination to avoid obstructions. Still, no tire pressure info.\n\nFurther down, there's a section on \"Einsatz auf dem Feld\" or Use on the Field, which includes safety warnings about working near moving parts and avoiding injuries. Again, nothing about tires.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the context doesn't directly address tire pressure for transport mode. However, I should check if any part mentions routine maintenance or specific settings related to tires during transport.\n\nLooking again, there's a section on \"Streuh\u00f6he\" where it says the height must be 75 cm above the ground or crop. But that's about the spread height, not tire pressure.\n\nWait, in another part under \"Maschine einstellen,\" it mentions adjusting the machine to the correct height for operation, but again, this is about the machine's position relative to the ground, not tires.\n\nI'm beginning to suspect that the context provided doesn't include specific information about tire pressure ranges. It focuses more on safe operations and setup rather than maintenance or pressure settings.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check if there are any tables or figures in the context that might reference tire pressure. The context includes some HTML structure with tables, but upon inspection, they seem to relate to evaluation and adjustment steps rather than technical specifications like tire pressure.\n\nGiven all this, it seems the context doesn't provide explicit information about the recommended tire pressure range for transport mode. It's possible that such details are in another part of the documentation not included here or that the focus is on other aspects like safety and setup.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

However, this might not directly answer the question about speed reduction.\n\nLooking further into the context, there's a section on \"Fahrmuster\" or driving patterns. It discusses two situations: working from furrows (Situation A) and without furrows (Situation B). In Situation A, it says to reduce the engine's RPM to 75% when the first pass is made, then after the first turn, use the hydraulic border spreader on the right side while keeping the left Dosier closed. Then, increase the RPM back to 100% for the second loop.\n\nIn Situation B, without furrows, it says to reduce the RPM to 75%, make the first pass, then apply the border spreader and open the right Dosier, followed by a second loop with a one Arbeitsbreite (meter) distance from the field edge. This suggests that reducing speed can help in maintaining consistent application rates.\n\nHowever, the exact percentage mentioned is 75% RPM reduction.

But the question is about preparing it for work in the spring, so maybe it's similar but focused on getting the machine ready to operate again after winter.\n\nLooking further, under \"Vorbereitung f\u00fcr die Winterlagerung,\" there are specific steps like cleaning, lubrication, drying, repairing any damages, and applying conservation oil or spray.

The context includes several sections about machine setup and maintenance, specifically mentioning the discharge bushing height adjustment.\n\nI come across a section titled \"Kontrolle und Einstellung H\u00f6he Auslaufrohr\" which translates to \"Control and Adjustment of Discharge Bushing Height.\" In this part, there's a mention that a feeler gauge can be used to measure small gaps accurately. It also states that if the measured gap is larger or smaller than 1.0 mm, specific adjustments should be made.\n\nLooking further, under the \"HINWEIS\" (Advice) section, it says: \"Use a feeler gauge with a thickness of 0.1 mm.\" This directly specifies the type and size of the feeler gauge recommended for this purpose.\n\nSo, putting it together, the context recommends using a feeler gauge material that's 0.1 mm thick for checking the discharge bushing height.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended material for the feeler gauge is **0.1 mm thickness**.",

There's also a part about replacing the seal for the R\u00fchrerwelle, specifically mentioning that the R\u00fchrerwelle is equipped with a Kunststoffdichtung, or plastic seal. It says this seal needs to be replaced every season and after 100 operating hours.\n\nI'm looking for specific details about the material of this seal. The context mentions \"Kunststoffdichtung,\" which means plastic seal. However, it doesn't specify the type of plastic used. There's no information about brands, types like PVC or rubber, or any other specifics beyond that it's a plastic seal.\n\nSince the question is asking for the material specification, and the context only mentions \"plastic\" without further details, I can conclude that the exact material isn't provided.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what material the \"metal seal rings\" for the agitator axle seal are made from. Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each part of the text to find any mention of \"metal seal rings.\" The context is a series of HTML documents, which seem to be technical manuals or instructions related to machinery, possibly agricultural or industrial equipment.\n\nI see several sections about different components and maintenance procedures. One section stands out: it's titled \"Dichtung R\u00fchrerwelle austauschen,\" which translates to \"Replacing the seal on the agitator axle.\" This is likely relevant because it discusses replacing a part that would involve seals.\n\nIn this specific section, there are numbered steps for replacing the seal. The fourth step mentions \"metal seal rings.\" Let me look at that exact passage:\n\n\"4. Tauschen Sie die Kunststoffdichtring aus.\"\nTranslating that, it means \"Replace the rubber gasket.\"\n\nWait, but earlier in the same context, under another section about \"Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus,\" there's a mention of \"metal seal rings.\" Let me check that:\n\n\"Controlling and setting the dosing mechanism. See page 133.\"\nBut I don't see the exact material mentioned here.\n\nGoing back to the agitator axle section, step 4 talks about replacing a rubber gasket, not a metal ring. However, in another part of the context, under \"Vermeiden Sie den Kontakt mit Kunstd\u00fcnger und anderen Mitteln,\" which translates to \"Avoid contact with artificial fertilizer and other substances,\" there's a mention of \"metal seal rings\" but it doesn't specify the material.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again. In the section about replacing the agitator axle seal, step 4 is about replacing a rubber part. But in another part, under \"Dichtung R\u00fchrerwelle austauschen,\" there's no mention of metal rings; it's all about replacing a gasket.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing different parts. Let me make sure. The question is specifically about the material of the metal seal rings for the agitator axle seal. From the context provided, in the section where they replace the seal on the agitator axle, step 4 says to replace the rubber gasket. There's no mention of metal rings there.\n\nHowever, earlier in another part of the text, under \"Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus,\" it mentions controlling and setting the dosing mechanism, but that doesn't specify the material of any seal rings.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look again. The exact question is about the material of the metal seal rings for the agitator axle seal. From the context, in the section where they replace the seal on the agitator axle, step 4 says to replace a rubber gasket, not a metal ring.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if \"metal seal rings\" are mentioned elsewhere. In another part of the text, under \"Vermeiden Sie den Kontakt mit Kunstd\u00fcnger und anderen Mitteln,\" it mentions that during filling, adjustment, and testing, one might come into contact with artificial fertilizer or other substances, advising to wear protective clothing.\n\nBut that's about avoiding contact, not specifying materials used in seals. So perhaps the context doesn't explicitly state the material of the metal seal rings for the agitator axle.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there was a mention in another section. Let me check again. In the \"Dichtung R\u00fchrerwelle austauschen\" section, step 4 is about replacing a rubber gasket, not a metal ring. So maybe the context doesn't specify the material of the metal seal rings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"metal seal rings\" are part of another component. Let me check if there's any mention of materials in other sections.\n\nLooking through the context again, I see that in the section about replacing the R\u00fchrerwelle (agitator axle) seal, they replace a rubber gasket but don't specify metal rings. However, in another part, under \"Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus,\" it says to check the condition of the R\u00fchrerwelle and its Dichtungsringe (seal rings). It mentions that the Dichtungsringe must be checked for wear.\n\nWait, perhaps the Dichtungsringe are made of a specific material. Let me see: in the context, under \"Dichtung R\u00fchrerwelle austauschen,\" step 4 says to replace the Kunststoffdichtring (rubber gasket). But earlier, in another part, it mentions \"Dichtungsring\" which is plural for seal rings.\n\nWait, perhaps the metal seal rings are part of",

Let me start by carefully reading through the context to find any relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll look for sections related to the drain kit or hopper emptying. Scanning through the context, I see a section titled \"Ablass-Satz\" which translates to \"Drain Kit.\" This seems promising because it's directly about the drain system.\n\nIn that section, there's a bullet point: \"Zum schnellen Ablassen von Restd\u00fcngemittel ist ein Ablass-Satz erh\u00e4ltlich.\" Translating this, it means \"For quick draining of residual fertilizer, a drain kit is available.\" However, this doesn't specify the rate.\n\nI continue reading and notice another part about the ExactLine: \"Die ExactLine ist ein genaues Grenzstreuhilfsmittel f\u00fcr das Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen von der letzten Spritzgasse aus.
