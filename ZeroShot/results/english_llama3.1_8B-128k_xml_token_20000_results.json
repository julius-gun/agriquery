This implies that the rate of corrosion may vary depending on the environment in which the machine is used. In coastal regions, the machine may be exposed to a more corrosive environment, such as saltwater, which could increase the rate of corrosion. Inland agricultural regions, the machine may be less exposed to corrosive substances, resulting in a lower rate of corrosion.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that the rate of corrosion on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD is higher for machines used in coastal areas compared to inland agricultural regions.",
