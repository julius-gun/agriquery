However, based on the context of the document, which is about operating a machine with a spreader, it can be inferred that the wind speed limit is related to the performance of the machine and the type of spreader used.\n\nIn one section, it mentions \"Bei niedrigen Dosierungen <50 kg/ha ist es möglich, den minimalen Behälterinhalt für die automatische Kalibrierung auf min. 15 kg zu senken.\" This suggests that at a dosage below 50 kg/ha, the machine's automatic calibration can be set to a minimum of 15 kg.\n\nIn another section, it mentions \"Die Dosis während des Streuens von der gewünschten Dosis abweichen\" which implies that the spreader is not functioning correctly and the actual dosage is deviating from the desired one. This could be due to various factors such as wind speed, but it does not provide a specific limit.\n\nHowever, in another section, it mentions \"Die automatische Kalibrierung wiegt das Bediensystem die verstreute Menge (kg) Kunstdünger in einer bestimmten Zeit.\" which implies that the machine's automatic calibration is based on the amount of fertilizer spread within a certain time frame. This could be related to wind speed, but it does not provide a specific limit.\n\nTherefore, I can only provide an educated guess that the typical wind speed limit before spreading quality becomes unacceptable might be around 15 m/s, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.",
