The text mentions that the spreader is equipped with a fine spread feature. Then, under \"Application rate,\" it says the machine has two actuators per dosing unit to set the application rate and working width independently. It also notes that you can shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings to precisely set the application rate with a low flowrate while limiting blockage risks.\n\nWait, so if there are three dosing openings in total and two are closed during fine application, that leaves one open. But the question is asking how many are closed, not how many remain open. So if two are closed, then the answer would be two.\n\nI should make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The context says it's possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings. That means during fine application, two are closed and one is open. Therefore, the number of dosing openings closed is two.\n</think>\n\nTwo dosing openings are closed during fine application.",

It mentions something called ExactLine and how it bends fertiliser granules to minimize loss. But I'm not sure if this is the system that measures the quantity.\n\nThen on page 30, under \"Getting familiar with the machine,\" there are sections like ISO control system and automatic weighing system. The text says the ISO control system uses ISOBUS communication for tractors. It also mentions a universal IsoMatch terminal for non-ISOBUS tractors. So this seems related to controlling the machine's functions.\n\nNext, under \"The spreader uses weighcells...\" it explains that the spreader has weighcells measuring fertilizer quantity being spread.

Scanning through the text, I see a section header on page 31: \"Automatic Calibration test\". That's a good starting point.\n\nNext, the content under that section mentions that the spreader carries out these tests every 75 kg or every minute. So it seems like there are two triggers for these tests: when the hopper has less than 100 kg, and also at regular intervals of either every 75 kg or every minute.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if \"every 75 kg\" is a specific interval or just another condition. The context says that the automatic calibration test is done every 75 kg or every minute. So it's not just based on time but also on the amount of fertilizer being spread.\n\nSo, putting this together, the spreader performs automatic calibration tests both when the hopper content drops below 100 kg and at regular intervals either every 75 kg of fertilizer or every minute. This means that the testing frequency isn't a fixed time interval like once per hour but is tied to the amount of fertilizer being used.\n\nTherefore, the answer should state that the spreader conducts automatic calibration tests every 75 kg of fertilizer applied or every minute, whichever comes first.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg of fertilizer applied or every minute.",

It says that if the speed isn't measured on the machine itself but via the tractor, then the speed sensor or adapter cable needs to be connected to the IsoMatch. A special cable set is required for this purpose.

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg per minute based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are several sections on page 68 that discuss dosing settings and calculations. One section mentions that if the application rate isn't directly indicated on the spreading chart, you can calculate the flowrate using a formula. The text says: \"flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)\".\n\nWait, but in the context, it's written as \"Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)\". So the formula is flowrate equals working width multiplied by driving speed multiplied by application rate. That makes sense because each of these factors contributes to determining how much fertilizer is applied.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other parts that might give a different formula. The context also mentions something about dosing openings, but that seems more about the equipment setup rather than the calculation itself. There's another part where it talks about calculating flowrate using a formula given below, but in the text provided, the actual formula isn't written out numerically, just described as \"the formula given below\".\n\nSo, based on what I can see, the formula is clearly stated: Working width (in meters) multiplied by driving speed (in kilometers per hour) multiplied by application rate (in kilograms per hectare). That's the exact formula needed to calculate the required flowrate in kg/min.\n\nI don't see any other information that would change or add to this formula. It seems straightforward and matches what's asked for.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer is:\n\nflowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) \u00d7 Driving speed (km/h) \u00d7 Application rate (kg/ha)\n\n**Answer:**  \nflowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)",

It also says that this leads to measurement accuracy declining, making it impossible for new automatic calibration to produce a better discharge curve.\n\nSo, putting that together, when the hopper has less than 100 kg, the automatic calibration is turned off by the control system. This affects the measurement accuracy and prevents the automatic calibration from improving the spread pattern.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration, leading to reduced measurement accuracy and preventing improved discharge curves.\n\n**Answer:** The control system switches off automatic calibration when hopper content is less than 100 kg.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what two actions must be done if the spreader fails or stops working while using it in the field. Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that on page 108, there's a section about a procedure with a hydraulic border spreading plate. There are several steps listed as ListItems. \n\nLooking at the ListItems, one of them is: \"\\uf034 Stop spreading immediately!\" So that's one action\u2014stopping right away.\n\nThen, further down, another ListItem says: \"\\uf034 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.\" Wait, but that seems more like an optional action rather than a necessary one. The question is about what must be done, not what you can choose to do.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The context mentions \"In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:\" and then lists \"\\uf034 Stop spreading immediately!\" as the first action. Then later, it says: \"\\uf034 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.\" Hmm, but this seems like an optional step, not a must-do.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question is asking for two actions that must be done. From the context, the only explicit action listed under \"In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:\" is stopping immediately. There's no second action mentioned here. \n\nLooking through the rest of the context, after the stop spreading instruction, there are more steps about disconnecting discs and adjusting the spreader, but those seem to be part of normal operation or setup, not specifically in response to a failure.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go back. The only two ListItems under \"In the event of spreader failure or stoppage:\" is the first one: stopping immediately. There's no second action explicitly mentioned here. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is just one action, but the question asks for two actions. Maybe I need to check if there's another instruction related to this situation elsewhere in the context.\n\nLooking again, after the stop spreading instruction, it says: \"\\uf034 If you want, you can choose to accelerate so that you are driving at the same speed as during full field spreading.\" But this is phrased as an option, not a must-do action. So maybe it's not required.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second action is implied but not explicitly stated in the context provided. Since the context doesn't mention another specific action beyond stopping immediately, I might have to conclude that only one action is specified here.\n\nBut the question asks for two actions. Maybe I need to check if there's another instruction related to this situation elsewhere. However, based on the given context, only stopping is mentioned. Therefore, perhaps the answer is just \"Stop spreading immediately!\" and the second action isn't found in the context.\n\nWait, but the user instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. So maybe that's the case here.\n</think>\n\nIn the event of spreader failure or stoppage, the only explicit action mentioned is stopping spreading immediately. The context does not provide a second required action beyond this.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

The relevant part seems to be towards the end where it mentions \"Explosion danger because of nitrate\" as a section header. The following text says that fertilizer containing nitrate can create an explosion danger if it comes into contact with fire.\n\nNow, the question is about welding on the machine after using such fertilizer. So, I'm thinking that the precaution would involve ensuring that any residual nitrate from the fertilizer doesn't interfere with the welding process because welding involves heat and sparks, which could potentially cause an explosion.\n\nLooking through the context again, there's a section header \"Avoid contact with materials\" and a corresponding text item about wearing protective clothing. However, this seems more related to general safety around the machine rather than specifically addressing the risk of nitrate after welding.\n\nWait, but the specific mention is that nitrate-containing fertilizer can cause an explosion if it comes into contact with fire. So, when welding, which generates heat and sparks, there's a risk that any remaining nitrate on or near the machine could ignite and cause an explosion.\n\nI don't see any direct instructions in the context about what to do before welding after using such fertilizer. It only mentions the danger but not the precaution. However, considering standard safety practices, one might infer that the area should be cleared of any flammable materials, including nitrate-containing fertilizers or residues, before welding.\n\nBut since the context doesn't explicitly state this, I'm not sure if it's intended to be inferred or if there's a specific instruction elsewhere. The closest is the mention of avoiding contact with materials and wearing protective gear, but that's more about general safety during maintenance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer should reflect the known risk without specific instructions, as the context doesn't provide precise steps.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Under that, it lists various maintenance tasks with their corresponding numbers and pages. Scanning through the list, I see item number 4: \"Condition of the vanes\". The content associated with this is listed as \"43\".\n\nSo, the task is to check the condition of the vanes every 10 hours, but it's also mentioned that this should be done weekly after the first 10 hours. Wait, no, actually, looking again, item number 4 says \"Condition of the vanes\" with a page number 43. But in the table, under item 4, it just has \"Condition of the vanes\" without an interval specified.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

But in the context provided, it's just stating that item 4 corresponds to page 43 without an interval.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look elsewhere for the interval. Wait, maybe the table lists the intervals next to each task. Let me check the structure again. The table seems to have columns where each row is a maintenance task and the corresponding page number. So, item 4 is \"Condition of the vanes\" on page 43.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find how often it's inspected. Maybe the interval is mentioned elsewhere in the context. Let me check other parts of the context. On page 124, there's a mention of lubrication with grease or oil, but that doesn't relate to inspection intervals.\n\nWait, perhaps the table on page 125 lists the maintenance tasks and their intervals. Item 4 is \"Condition of the vanes\" without an interval specified in the content provided. So maybe I need to infer from the surrounding context. The first item (item 1) is checking bolts and nuts every 10 hours or 100 hours min., once per year. Similarly, other items have intervals like weekly after the first 10 hours.\n\nWait, looking at the table again: \n\n- Item 1: Checking bolts and nuts - every 10 hours, 100 hours min., once per year.\n- Item 2: Checking hydraulic system - same interval.\n- Item 3: Condition of agitator and axle - same as above.\n- Item 4: Condition of vanes - page 43. No interval specified here.\n\nBut perhaps the interval is implied by the fact that other similar tasks have intervals like weekly after the first 10 hours, etc. Alternatively, maybe the interval for vanes is every 10 hours or once per year as well.\n\nWait, but in the context provided, item 4 only mentions \"Condition of the vanes\" without an interval. So perhaps I need to check if there's another part where it specifies the interval for vanes.\n\nLooking again at page 125: The table lists up to item 23, with some having intervals like every 10 hours or once per year. Item 4 is just \"Condition of the vanes\" without an interval specified in the content provided.\n\nSo, based on this, I might not have enough information to determine the exact interval for the vanes.

Scanning through the table items, I see entries like checking bolts and nuts, hydraulic system, agitator condition, vanes, etc. \n\nNow, focusing on the specific task related to the agitator seal. The context has an entry numbered 21: \"agitator seal\" with a page number of 140. This suggests that the agitator seal is checked at interval 140. However, I need to confirm if this refers to replacement or just checking.\n\nWait, in the table, each item lists what needs to be done and the interval. For example, item 21 says \"agitator seal\" with a page number of 140. But does that mean it's replaced every 140 hours?

Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque (Nm) = (Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Bolt Capacity \u00d7 Thread Size). The context provided includes a table with different bolt sizes and their corresponding torques based on two friction coefficients, 0.10 and 0.13.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific bolt size (M5 to M24), and for each size, there are two torque values: one for the lower coefficient (0.10) and another for the higher (0.13). The question specifies an M18 bolt with a 10.9 quality and a friction of 0.13.\n\nI need to locate the M18 row in the table. Scanning through, I see that M18 is on line number 7. For M18, under 0.13 friction, the torque is listed as 410 Nm. \n\nWait, but the context mentions \"Torques for bolts and nuts with serrated lower edges 10% extra,\" which applies to this bolt since it's an M18 with a serrated edge. However, in the table provided, the torques are already considering the friction coefficients without mentioning any additional percentages. So I think the 410 Nm is the correct figure here.\n\nI should double-check if there's any mention of extra torque for serrated edges elsewhere in the context. The context does have a note about Tensilock and Whizlock, which are specific types of bolts with serrated edges, but the table doesn't specify an additional 10% on top of the torques listed. Therefore, I should stick to the value provided in the table.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the torque required is 410 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque for fastening the M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 0.13 friction coefficient is **410 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:** 410",

Let me start by breaking down the question.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque = Friction Coefficient \u00d7 Force \u00d7 Diameter. But wait, in this context, it's probably referring to the standard torque values provided in the table rather than calculating from scratch.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a table on page 129 with different M sizes and their corresponding torques for two levels (10 and 13 Nm). The elements are labeled as Torques.4.6.0,10 and .13, etc. I think this refers to the torque values for each M size at two different levels.\n\nSince the question is about an M6 bolt, I need to find the row corresponding to M6 in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- M5: Torque 1.7 Nm (10) and 2 Nm (13)\n- M6: Torque 3 Nm (10) and 4 Nm (13)\n- M8: Torque 8 Nm (10) and 9 Nm (13)\n- And so on.\n\nSo, for an M6 bolt at the 10 Nm level, the torque is 3 Nm. But wait, the friction coefficient is given as 0.2. In the context, there's a note that the higher value of 0.13 applies to dry sheets, but here it's 0.2. However, in the table, the torques are already considering different factors, including friction.\n\nI think the table provides pre-calculated values based on standard conditions, so I don't need to adjust for the given 0.2 coefficient because it's likely already factored into the torque numbers provided. Therefore, the torque required is 3 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque for an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality is **3 Nm**.\n\nAnswer: 3",

That seems like it's for larger fields.\n\nThen, under \"One-sided boundary spreading with border spreading plate,\" it says you can drive along the field edge with a half spreading pattern filled to 100%. It mentions using a border spreading plate and one closed dosing unit. The goal is to optimize the spreading pattern to reduce environmental pollution when adjusting the border spreading plate.\n\nSo, one-sided boundary spreading allows for driving along the field edge with a specific spreading pattern. It's about managing how fertilizer is applied, especially on the edges. \n\nNow, considering small gardens, I'm thinking that if this method helps in applying fertilizer efficiently without overlapping too much or causing waste, it might be suitable. The context doesn't explicitly say whether it's for small gardens, but since it's a spreading pattern adjustment, it could apply to various sizes.\n\nI don't see any information that restricts its use to large fields only.

So, spreading the field first helps the system determine the correct settings.\n\nMoving on to page 107, it discusses one-sided boundary spreading using a hydraulic plate. The operation involves driving along the field edge and using the plate to spread fertilizer granules. The working width can be adjusted by changing the plate. There are directions about how much to spread\u2014less for environmental settings to reduce loss but with less cover, or more for yield settings with better cover but more loss.\n\nThe maximum acceptable loss is up to 10% beyond the field edge, as per standards. Testing the spreading pattern of the border plate is advised before use.\n\nNow, the question is about seven-sided boundary spreading.

The context does talk about lubricating and cleaning the machine before storage but doesn't specify the type of paint.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. There's a part where it says to \"Paint any damaged paintwork.\" But without more details, like the brand or type, I can't provide a specific paint name. The context also mentions using a high-pressure cleaner but doesn't link that to painting.\n\nSo, based on what's given, there's no explicit information about the specific paint to use. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context\" because the question asks for a specific type of paint, and it's not provided here.\n</think>\n\nThe specific paint used for touching up damaged areas during preparation is not mentioned in the provided context.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

It mentions that switching functions and data transfer between the tractor terminal or ISO control box and the machine are handled via ISOBUS. Specifically, tilling and reacting to field conditions can be done through ISOBUS communication. With GPS, various sensors, and management systems receive necessary info for optimal control.\n\nThen there's a section on \"ISOBUS functionality via IsoMatch.\" It says that tractors without their own ISO terminal can work as ISO tractors using the IsoMatch control box. So, IsoMatch acts as an ISO terminal in this case.\n\nNext, under \"Driving speed, RPM and GPS signal on IsoMatch,\" it's explained that if speed isn't measured on the machine itself but via the tractor, the speed sensor or adapter cable needs to connect to IsoMatch. A special cable set is required for this. Similarly, for PTO shaft RPM, an extra sensor is available.\n\nFor GPS, the signal can be used via RS-232 on the control box, which is necessary for GEOCONTROL functionality. It also mentions referring to the manual that comes with the control box.\n\nNow, looking at the question again: it's asking about detailed technical specs and bandwidth of different ISOBUS versions compatible with IsoMatch Tellus.

Then it moves on to \"Save and read,\" listing Documents, Tractor data, Field data, Work particulars of various ISO machines, and Client particulars.\n\nAfter that, there are some TextItem elements which provide more detailed information. The first one says: \"With the main switch on the upper left in the red extension, you can switch the control box on and off.\" Then it mentions pressing a button for at least one second. Another TextItem warns: \"Always switch off the control box when you leave the tractor.\" It also explains that if the box is engaged while the tractor is in the danger area, unintended functions can be activated, and since the control box uses power, the tractor battery could be flattened.\n\nAnother TextItem mentions that after starting up, a screen appears with the last two selected applications. Then there's a section about \"Compact and complete,\" talking about IsoMatch Go being a handy version with a single screen, differences in USB connections, and absence of Wlan/Wifi.\n\nNow, focusing on the question: How many hours can IsoMatch Tellus operate before flattening the battery if left switched on with engine off. I need to find specific information related to this.\n\nLooking through the context, I see that when the control box is engaged (left switched on), it uses power from the tractor's battery. The TextItem specifically states: \"If the box is engaged, unintended functions can be activated while you are in the danger area. Moreover, the control box uses power, as a result of which the tractor battery could be flattened.\"\n\nSo, the key point here is that leaving the control box (main switch) on with the engine off will drain the battery, potentially flattening it. However, I don't see any specific time duration mentioned in the context. It just mentions that the battery could be flattened as a result of using power.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, there's no exact number of hours provided.

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that on page 141, there's a section about maintenance. Under this, there are several list items. One of them mentions removing the metal seal rings. Another one talks about putting them back in position. So, it seems like these are parts that can be taken off and then reinstalled.\n\nI'm trying to find out what material these rings are made from. The context doesn't explicitly say \"metal\" again after mentioning the metal seal rings. It just refers to them as \"metal seal rings.\" There's no additional info provided about their composition, like whether they're stainless steel or another type of metal.\n\nSince there's no specific information given beyond calling them metal, I can't determine the exact material. The context doesn't provide details on materials, only that they are called metal seal rings.\n</think>\n\nThe 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal are made of **metal**.",

        "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what specific extension cable length in meters is optimal for an ISO 11786 in-cab tractor connection. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a lot of information about various cables related to the IM Tellus sensor input and ISO connections. On page 144, it mentions that an extended ISO cable is available for a tractor-trailed spreader. It says this replaces the short cable already fitted and that the whole cable should be exchanged.\n\nHmm, so they're talking about replacing the existing cable with an extended one. The key point here is that the extended ISO cable is meant to replace the shorter one. I don't see any specific measurements given in the context, like meters or feet. It just mentions that it's an extension and replaces the short cable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. There's a mention of \"extended ISO cable\" but no numbers. The only other cables mentioned are the standard ones, like the 7-point plug cable and RS232, but those aren't extensions either.\n\nSo, based on this, there's no specific length provided in the context. It just says that an extended cable is available to replace the short one. Without a specified length, I can't extract any numerical value from it.\n\nTherefore, since the question asks for a specific extension cable length in meters and the context doesn't provide that information, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify the optimal length of the extension cable for ISO 11786 in-cab tractor connections. \n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the duration of the free test period for the GEOCONTROL software user licence. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the context given. It's a list of elements from page 145, which includes various items like \"Spreader control software,\" \"GEOCONTROL software,\" \"IsoMatch Grip,\" and others. The key part related to the user licence is here: \n\n\"Accessories, additional_info: 'A user licence can be purchased via the IsoMatch shop which, after the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with...'\"\n\nSo, this sentence mentions that a user licence is available through the IsoMatch shop. It also says that after the free test period expires, you can purchase the licence to continue using the software.\n\nNow, the question specifically asks for the duration of this free test period in days. Looking at the context, I don't see any numbers or specific durations mentioned. The only information given is about purchasing the licence after the test period ends, but there's no indication of how long that period lasts.\n\nI need to check if there's any other part of the context that might have this information. Scanning through the elements again, I see mentions of features like task controller, external application rate, headland management, and GEOSPREAD functions, but nothing about the test period duration.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide a specific number of days for the free trial, I can't extract any numerical value from it. Therefore, based on the given information, the answer should be that the duration isn't specified in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nThe duration of the free test period for the GEOCONTROL software user licence is not specified in the provided context.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

But I don't see any specific details about the type of valves or their manufacturer here.\n\nI also check other sections on page 148, like ExactLine and Hydraulic border spreading plate, but those don't mention anything about valves for the hopper empty sensor. There's a reference to \"see paragraph 'Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines' on page 13\" and another about \"Boundary track spreading with ExactLine on page 110,\" but neither seems relevant to valve types or manufacturers.\n\nSince there's no direct information provided about the specific valves used, I can't extract any details from the context. Therefore, based on the given data, I don't have enough information to answer the question accurately.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

Scanning through, I see that on page 148, there's a section about the \"Hopper empty sensor\" which mentions an alarm when the hopper is almost empty and that it usually comes with a valve set. But nothing here talks about the drain kit's flow rate.\n\nWait, maybe the calibration container or other accessories have related info? On page 149, the calibration container is discussed in terms of testing application rates but no drain rate. The drain kit's only description is that it allows quick emptying, which is a bit vague.\n\nI don't see any specific numbers or technical details about the drain rate in liters per minute. All the context says is that it empties the hopper quickly, but without specifics.
