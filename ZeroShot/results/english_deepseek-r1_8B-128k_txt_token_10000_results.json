It mentions that in fine application mode, two of the three dosing openings are closed. This is done to allow a low flowrate while minimizing blockages.\n\nSo, during fine application, two dosing openings are closed out of the total three available. That means only one opening remains open for the fertiliser to flow through, allowing precise control even at lower rates.\n</think>\n\nDuring fine application, 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed, leaving 1 open.\n\n**Answer:** 2 dosing openings are closed during fine application.",

It mentions that the full field spreading pattern overlaps 100%. Specifically, it says, \"A triangular spreading pattern that completely overlaps can be expected with most fertiliser types with an average working width.\" \n\nSo, the key point here is that when using the full field spreading pattern, the overlap is 100%. This means that each pass covers the entire field without any gaps, ensuring even distribution.\n\nI should make sure I'm not confusing this with other patterns mentioned, like gored spreading or boundary track spreading. Those have different percentages and are discussed in other parts of the context.

The question is about a system that measures the fertilizer quantity being spread continuously.\n\nOn page 30, it mentions the ISO control system using ISOBUS communication. It says the spreader uses weighcells to measure the quantity of fertilizer being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit.\n\nSo, the key part here is that the ISO control system uses weighcells to continuously measure the fertilizer quantity. This means the system is always monitoring and adjusting based on the application rate.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other systems mentioned. Page 31 talks about flowrate calculation using a formula involving working width, driving speed, and application rate. However, this seems more about calculating rather than continuously measuring.\n\nPage 27 discusses RATE control with MULTIRATE, which adjusts application rates based on external signals, but again, it's more about variable rates rather than continuous measurement.\n\nSo, the main system mentioned is the ISO control system using weighcells to measure and monitor fertilizer quantity.\n</think>\n\nThe ISO control system uses weighcells to continuously measure the fertilizer quantity being spread.

It says that the computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate using a formula involving working width, driving speed, and application rate.\n\nThen, it mentions that automatic calibration tests are carried out every 75 kg or every minute.

On page 39, it mentions that if the tractor isn't equipped with ISOBUS, you can use an IsoMatch power cable set to make the tractor ISOBUS ready. It also says that this involves connecting a CAN plug from the IsoMatch to the tractor's CAN connection.\n\nLooking at page 41, there's more detail about using the IsoMatch on a non-ISOBUS tractor.

The context is a series of pages from a manual, and each page has specific information related to using and maintaining the machine.\n\nStarting from Page 19, it talks about safety precautions when operating the machine, like disconnecting the battery and proper connection methods. Then, as I go through the pages, I see that Page 39 mentions something about the control box. It says:\n\n\"Before first use, be careful that nothing gets jammed while mounting the spreader. Work carefully: \u00b7 place the machine on adequate supports, \u00b7 switching off the PTO shaft, \u00b7 releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system, \u00b7 Switch off the electronic control system, \u00b7 switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition, \u00b7 engage the parking brake of the tractor, \u00b7 wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes, \u00b7 carefully follow the instructions given. Friction with these materials could cause physical injury!\"\n\nThis doesn't directly mention the main switch button, but it's about precautions during assembly.\n\nMoving on to Page 40, which is titled \"Before first use\" and discusses console assembly. It mentions:\n\n\"Mount the control box in a place where it would: \u00b7 be well visible, \u00b7 easy to operate while spreading, \u00b7 and result in minimal visual hindrance while driving the tractor.\"\n\nIt then goes into details about mounting the console on the control box, including how to attach it with fixing materials and ensuring visibility. Again, no mention of the main switch button's duration.\n\nPage 41 talks about using the IsoMatch terminal on an ISO tractor or a non-ISO tractor. It explains how to connect the control box via CAN cables but doesn't touch on the switch button.\n\nPage 42 discusses hopper extensions and covers, which is unrelated.\n\nPage 43 is about parking wheels and vanes, again not relevant.\n\nPage 44 mentions mud guards and steps, still nothing about the main switch.\n\nPage 45 talks about coupling shaft connections and ExactLine, not helpful here.\n\nPage 46 discusses hydraulic border spreading plates, again not relevant.\n\nPage 47 is about the calibration container, which involves a sensor but not the main switch.\n\nPage 48 goes into detail about using a calibration container to set dosing settings. It explains how to mount it on the spreading disc and adjust it, but nothing about turning the control box on or off.\n\nFinally, Page 39 again mentions:\n\n\"With the main switch on the upper left in the red extension, you can switch the control box on and off. Press the button for at least 1 sec.\"\n\nAh, here we go. This is the only mention of the main switch button. It says that to turn the control box on or off, you press the main switch button for at least one second.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be that the main switch button needs to be pressed for a minimum of one second to turn the control box on or off.\n</think>\n\nThe main switch button must be pressed for at least 1 second to turn the control box on or off. \n\nAnswer: Press the main switch button for at least 1 second.",

Specifically, line 14 mentions \"Working width (m)\" with various options like 24, 27/28, 30, 32/33, 36, 39, and 42*. There's also a note that some working widths require a vane set for larger widths.\n\nOn page 44, there's a section about vanes, which are part of the spreading disc. It says that the long vanes are positioned in groups of three, and the first vane wears out quickly, so they need to be replaced periodically to ensure even wear and optimal spreading patterns.\n\nAdditionally, on page 59, it talks about determining the distribution of fertiliser granules using a distribution meter, which affects how evenly the fertilizer is spread. However, this seems more related to the distribution rather than the working width itself.\n\nLooking back at page 36, line 14 clearly states that the working width is determined by the RPM of the spreading disc, which depends on the PTO shaft RPM and the connection from the coupling shaft. This connection point is indicated in the spreading chart, as mentioned on pages 46 and 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the machine's working width is primarily determined by the RPM of the spreading disc, which is influenced by the tractor's PTO shaft speed and the specific coupling shaft setting.

Let me make sure I understand each component:\n\n- **Working width**: This is the distance between the sprayer tramlines, which is set based on the spreading chart.\n- **Driving speed**: The speed at which the tractor is moving while spreading.\n- **Application rate**: The desired amount of fertilizer to be applied per hectare (kg/ha).\n\nSo, if I have these three values, I can plug them into this formula to get the required flowrate in kg/min. \n\nI should also check if there are any other formulas mentioned that might relate to this.

The context seems to be a series of pages from a manual or guide related to spreading equipment, likely a fertilizer spreader. The question is about loading manually, so I should focus on sections that discuss loading procedures.\n\nI remember seeing mentions of platforms and loading heights in the context. Let me scan through the pages. \n\nPage 74 talks about \"Loading height\" and mentions that if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags, a load platform must be used. So, the maximum allowed without needing a platform is 1250 mm.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the maximum in mm before a platform is mandatory. The context says that if it's more than 1250 mm, a platform is needed. Therefore, the maximum distance without needing a platform would be 1250 mm minus any extra required for safety or stability.\n\nBut the exact wording on page 74 is: \"A load platform must be used if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags.\" So, if it's over 1250 mm, a platform is needed.

However, I'm specifically looking for information related to the distance between the spreader and the loading platform.\n\nI'll go through each page one by one to see if any mention this distance. \n\nPage 64 talks about setting up the coupling shaft and working width but doesn't mention the loading platform distance. Page 65 discusses discharge points and PTO speed, still nothing relevant. Pages 66-70 cover application rates, dosing settings, and flowrates\u2014no direct info here.\n\nPage 71 mentions a manual calibration test but again, not about the loading platform. Page 72 talks about variable application rates via an RS232 connection, which isn't helpful for this question. \n\nMoving on to page 74, I see some safety instructions about filling the machine and avoiding blockages. It mentions using a load platform if the distance between the hopper rim and the ground is more than 1250 mm while filling manually or with large bags. This seems relevant because it refers to a loading platform.\n\nPage 75 continues this thought, stating that a load platform must be used if the distance is over 1250 mm. It also mentions checking dosing units and closing them if necessary. The key point here is that when using a fixed loading platform, the machine shouldn't rest on the ground but should be lifted at least 10 cm.\n\nSo, from page 74-75, it's clear that the maximum distance between the spreader (hopper) and the loading platform is 1250 mm. This is because if the hopper is filled while on the ground without a platform, the distance would exceed this, potentially causing issues like chunks forming or damage.\n\nI don't see any other pages that provide a different number, so I can be confident that 1250 mm is the correct maximum distance.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum distance between the spreader and the loading platform is **1250 mm**.

The purpose seems to be ensuring that both sides spread evenly.\n\nOn page 77, it says the tray test checks if the left and right spreading discs are distributing the same volume. This is important for a good spreading pattern. They also mention that this should be done every year or after any changes to the spreader.\n\nLooking at page 78, the operation involves setting up troughs along the working width, placing them horizontally with a spirit level, and then driving over them while collecting samples. The results are compared between left and right discs.\n\nPage 79 talks about assessing the test by comparing measurements from both sides and calculating percentage differences. If there's more than a 3% difference, adjustments might be needed.\n\nSo putting this together, the tray test checks if both spreading discs distribute fertiliser evenly across the working width.

The context mentions several pages related to testing different spreading patterns, including the ExactLine on page 89. \n\nOn page 89, it says: \"When using the ExactLine... allow the hydraulic valve to run a few seconds to bring the ExactLine to working condition...\" That's about preparing the ExactLine, but not directly the height.\n\nThen, looking at page 90, which is about testing the ExactLine spreading pattern. It mentions placing troughs and starting the tractor. The key part here is: \"Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width...\" But again, this is more about setting up based on the chart rather than a specific height.\n\nWait, earlier in the context, specifically on page 95, there's a section about adjusting the machine. It says: \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" So this is about setting the spreader height to 75 cm above the ground or crop.\n\nBut when testing the ExactLine, do we need the same height? Let me check if there's any specific instruction for the ExactLine test regarding height. \n\nLooking at page 90 again: \"Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart...\" and then later, \"Drive along the tracks and open the dosing units a few metres before you drive over the first bucket in the middle by pressing the start key.\" It doesn't specify the height here.\n\nHowever, on page 95, it's clear that for general use, the spreader should be set to 75 cm above the ground or crop. Since testing the ExactLine is part of ensuring proper spreading, I think the same height applies. \n\nSo, even though the context doesn't explicitly state the height for the ExactLine test, the standard setup is 75 cm.

The text says: \"The maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards.

The context is a series of pages from a manual about operating a spreader. I remember that the PTO shaft is related to the power take-off, which is used to drive the spreading discs.\n\nLooking at page 95, it mentions adjusting the machine and setting the height correctly. But that's not directly about the PTO shaft. \n\nThen on page 97, it talks about driving on the road and preparing the machine for transport. It says something about checking weight distribution and mounting front weights. Not directly related to the PTO.\n\nPage 98 discusses tramline patterns and using ExactLine or hydraulic border spreading plates. Still not about the PTO shaft after disengagement.\n\nMoving to page 100, it's about starting spreading and mentions the PTO shaft rpm must remain constant. But again, not about stopping the PTO.\n\nPage 101 talks about over and underdosing and some technical details about calibration. Not relevant here.\n\nPage 102 is about working on the headland with GEOCONTROL. Page 103 discusses hydraulic border spreading plate operation. \n\nPage 104 mentions driving patterns without GEOCONTROL. It says to stop spreading by closing dosing units, let discs turn without switching off PTO, then open again at a certain point. But after disengaging PTO, what happens?\n\nLooking further, page 93 is about preparing the machine for transport. It includes steps like checking weight distribution and securing parts. However, it doesn't directly mention the PTO shaft danger.\n\nWait, on page 95, there's a section about adjusting the machine in the field. It says that after switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise because the machine continues to run due to inertia. So, if you stop the PTO, the tractor keeps moving because of momentum. That means someone could approach while it's still moving, leading to injury.\n\nSo, the continued danger is that the tractor keeps moving after the PTO is disengaged because inertia causes it to move forward. This can be dangerous if someone isn't aware and tries to get near the moving machine.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, the tractor continues to move due to inertia, posing a danger as it may collide with or injure someone approaching it.\n\n**Answer:** The continued danger is that the tractor keeps moving after the PTO shaft is disengaged, risking injury from collisions.",

This seems relevant because it directly addresses the height setting for the spreader.\n\nAdditionally, on Page 96, during the last setting check, one of the questions is whether the spreader's height was set correctly. It references ensuring that the height is 75 cm above the ground or crop. \n\nSo, putting this together, both pages 95 and 96 emphasize that the recommended height for the spreader is 75 centimeters above the ground or crops.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended height of the spreader is **75 centimeters** above the ground or crops.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several pages discussing various aspects of using a spreader, including settings, adjustments, and troubleshooting. The question specifically asks about the hopper content being less than 100 kg. \n\nI remember seeing mentions of automatic calibration in the context. On page 101, it says that if the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. This is because the measurement accuracy would decline, making it impossible to produce a better discharge curve.\n\nSo, when the hopper has less than 100 kg left, the automatic calibration feature is turned off. This prevents inaccurate dosing since the spreader can't reliably measure the exact amount needed for the application rate. The user would need to manually adjust or refill the hopper as necessary.\n\nI don't see any other effects mentioned beyond the automatic calibration being disabled. There's no indication of stopping the spreading process unless there's a failure, but the primary effect is on the calibration feature.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the control system disables automatic calibration to prevent inaccurate dosing. This adjustment is necessary as the spreader can't reliably measure the application rate with insufficient material left.\n\n**Answer:** The control system switches off automatic calibration when hopper content drops below 100 kg, preventing accurate measurement and requiring manual adjustments.",

Then on page 108, it describes a procedure for using this plate, adjusting the spreader settings, and starting the tractor.\n\nPage 110 talks about boundary track spreading with ExactLine, which involves driving along sprayer tramlines set at half the working width from the field edge.

That makes sense because continuing could lead to uneven application, which isn't good for the crop.\n\nPage 115 also discusses damage and stoppage causes.

It suggests examining the discs and discharge openings, possibly removing vanes to see if something is blocking them.\n\nSo putting this together, the steps would be: first, stop the machine immediately because continuing could cause more issues. Then, inspect the spreading disc and the discharge area to find any obstructions or damage. If you can't fix it on the spot, you might need to remove parts like vanes to check further.

However, on page 117, there's an additional note: \"do not set up electrical components. Water can cause electrical failures.\" This implies that water is used but doesn't mention temperature restrictions.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something.

Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. It's about a specific measurement related to the spreader mechanism.\n\nLooking through the context provided, I see that it's a detailed manual for maintaining and storing agricultural machinery, particularly focusing on a spreader. The pages cover various maintenance tasks, including checking and setting different components of the machine.\n\nI'll go through each page to find any mention of the rope and discharge bushing. Starting from Page 135, there's a section about \"Setting the dosing baffles.\" It mentions ensuring the correct distance between the dosing plates to avoid issues with fertiliser application. However, this doesn't directly relate to the rope and discharge bushing.\n\nMoving on to Page 137, which discusses \"Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism,\" I see that it talks about adjusting the position of the dosing mechanism relative to the spreading disc. It mentions measuring the distance between the inside of the rope and the opening of the discharge bushing. The exact requirement is stated as 109 mm.\n\nPage 138 specifically addresses \"Checking and setting the discharge bushing height.\" Here, it's clear that the distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be exactly 1.0 mm.

        "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, M18 refers to the size of the bolt, which is standard across different industries. The \"hexagon steel bolt\" part tells me it's a hexagonal-headed bolt made from steel. The 10.9 quality likely refers to the strength grade of the bolt, where 10.9 indicates that it can withstand up to 10.9 Nm (Newtons-meter) of torque without breaking.\n\nNext, the friction coefficient is given as 0.13. Friction in this context relates to the force needed to overcome the resistance between the bolt head and the surface it's being fastened into. A higher friction coefficient means more force is required to turn the bolt, which translates to a higher torque value when considering the moment arm.\n\nI recall that torque (T) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{Friction\\ Coefficient \\times Bolt\\ Strength}{Diameter} \\]\n\nBut wait, I think I might have mixed up something. Let me double-check the correct formula for torque based on bolt strength and friction. The correct formula should consider both the shear strength of the bolt and the friction that holds it in place.\n\nThe shear strength (or tensile strength) of a bolt is given by its grade, which here is 10.9 Nm. The friction factor comes into play when determining how much torque is needed to overcome the resistance before the bolt starts to turn.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{Friction\\ Coefficient \\times Bolt\\ Strength}{Diameter} \\]\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Let me think again. The torque required to start turning a bolt is often calculated by considering both the shear strength and the friction. However, in many cases, especially with hexagonal bolts, the friction is considered as part of the total resistance.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for torque based on the torque needed to overcome the friction before the bolt begins to shear. So, if the bolt can handle 10.9 Nm in shear and there's a friction factor of 0.13, then the torque required would be:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{Friction\\ Coefficient \\times Bolt\\ Strength}{Diameter} \\]\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident about this formula. Let me look up the standard method for calculating torque with bolts considering both shear and friction.\n\nUpon checking, I find that when a bolt is subject to both shear and friction, the total torque required can be calculated by adding the torque due to shear and the torque due to friction. However, in many engineering contexts, especially with hexagonal bolts, the friction is considered as part of the initial resistance before the bolt starts to shear.\n\nThe formula I found is:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{Friction\\ Coefficient \\times Bolt\\ Strength}{Diameter} \\]\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n- Friction coefficient (\u03bc) = 0.13\n- Bolt strength (Tensile strength) = 10.9 Nm\n- Diameter of M18 bolt = 18 mm\n\nCalculating torque:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{0.13 \\times 10.9}{18} \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 0.13 by 10.9:\n\n0.13 * 10.9 = 1.417\n\nThen divide by the diameter (18):\n\n1.417 / 18 \u2248 0.0787 Nm\n\nWait, that seems really low. Is that correct? I thought torque would be higher than that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the shear strength and friction separately. The shear strength is 10.9 Nm, which is the maximum torque before the bolt starts to strip. But with friction, you need more torque to overcome it before the bolt can apply that shear strength.\n\nSo perhaps the total torque required is:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{Friction\\ Coefficient \\times Bolt\\ Diameter}{Shear\\ Strength} \\]\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: The torque needed to overcome friction before the bolt starts to shear would be:\n\n\\[ T_{friction} = \\mu \\times T_{shear} \\]\n\nBut that's not quite right either because torque and force are different units. I need to convert between them correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the total resistance as a combination of both shear and friction. The total torque would then be:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{Friction\\ Coefficient \\times Bolt\\ Strength}{Diameter} \\]\n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me try another way. If the bolt can handle 10.9 Nm in shear, that's the maximum",

        "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and with a 0.2 friction be fastened?",
        "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the torque required to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. Let me start by understanding what each part of the question means.\n\nFirst, the bolt is M6, which refers to its size. M stands for metric, and 6 means the diameter is 6mm. Hexagon means it's a hexagonal head, which is common for bolts because it provides a larger contact area for the wrench.\n\nNext, it's stainless steel, which is good because it's durable and resistant to corrosion. The quality is 70 (A2). I think A2 refers to the strength grade of the material. 70 probably indicates the tensile strength in Newtons per square millimeter or something similar. But since the question is about torque, maybe that part isn't directly needed.\n\nThe friction coefficient is given as 0.2. Friction is important because it affects how much force is needed to overcome the resistance between the bolt and the hole it's being screwed into. A higher friction coefficient means more torque is required to loosen or tighten the bolt.\n\nNow, looking at the context provided, I see that there are tables listing torque guidelines for different bolts and nuts. Specifically, on page 129, there's a table with \"Steel tightening torques\" which includes M5, M6, etc., and their respective torques based on quality and friction coefficients.\n\nFrom the table:\n- For M6 bolts with A2 quality (which I think corresponds to 70), the torque is listed as 3.6 Nm for a friction coefficient of 0.10 and 6.3 Nm for 0.20. Since our question specifies 0.2, that would be the higher value.\n\nSo, the torque needed would be 6.3 Nm. But I should double-check to make sure I'm interpreting the table correctly. The context mentions that the friction coefficient of 0.10 applies to oiled sheets, cast iron, hardened surfaces, greased threads, etc., and a higher value of 0.13 applies to dry sheets. However, in this case, it's specified as 0.2, which isn't directly listed but falls between 0.13 and whatever the next coefficient is. But since the table doesn't go beyond 0.30 for A2, I think we have to stick with the closest value provided.\n\nTherefore, using 0.20 as the friction coefficient, the torque should be 6.3 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten the M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt is **6.3 Nm**.\n\n<answer>\n6.3\n</answer>",

Stop spreading immediately! Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!\"\n\nSo both these pages mention stopping spreading and disconnecting the PTO. It looks like the procedure is consistent across different sections.\n\nI should make sure there's no other information that might add to this, but from what I can see, the main actions are stopping the spreader and disconnecting the PTO.\n</think>\n\nTo stop spreading fertilizer, follow these steps: Stop the tractor, immediately disconnect the Power Take-Off (PTO) shaft, and ensure all movement ceases to prevent further distribution.",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum height the fertilizer flies when spreading without the GEOCONTROL headland. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 100, it talks about starting spreading with or without GEOCONTROL. Without GEOCONTROL, the process involves driving to the first tramline, switching on the control box, checking settings, and then starting to spread. It mentions that the driving speed must remain constant, and the PTO shaft RPM is set correctly.\n\nOn page 101, it says that if the hopper content is less than 100 kg, the automatic calibration switches off. But that's more about calibration, not height.\n\nPage 102 discusses working method on the headland with GEOCONTROL, which adjusts the spreading sections based on overlap settings. However, without GEOCONTROL, the spreader just follows the set pattern.\n\nLooking at page 103, it mentions that during one-sided over or underdosing, the application rate can deviate because of overlapping patterns, especially in narrow widths. But again, nothing about height.\n\nPage 104 talks about GEOCONTROL headland function, which manages overlaps, but without it, the spreader just continues as set.\n\nOn page 105, it's about over and underdosing based on soil or crop conditions, using control system settings to adjust left, right, or both sides. No mention of height here either.\n\nPage 106 discusses border spreading methods, both with and without GEOCONTROL. It says that without GEOCONTROL, you stop spreading before the end of the field edge, let discs turn, then open again. But no info on height.\n\nPage 107 is about one-sided boundary spreading with a hydraulic plate, adjusting the width but not the height.\n\nPage 108 details procedure with the hydraulic border spreading plate, setting the correct height via the chart, and starting the tractor. It mentions checking settings but doesn't specify height during spreading without GEOCONTROL.\n\nPage 109 discusses driving patterns, adjusting PTO RPM to 75% for the first pass, then back to 100%. No info on height here.\n\nPage 110 is about boundary track spreading with ExactLine, setting half working width from the edge. Again, nothing about height.\n\nPage 111 talks about using the ExactLine, engaging it by running hydraulic valves, checking settings, and starting the tractor. It mentions the ExactLine symbol on the screen but doesn't tie this to height without GEOCONTROL.\n\nPage 112 is about stopping work, closing dosing units, switching off PTO, etc., which isn't relevant here.\n\nPage 113 discusses failures and stoppages, mentioning issues like blocked agitators or discharge bushings. No info on height.\n\nPage 114 talks about damage, checking for blockages, sieves, etc. Not related to height.\n\nPage 115 is about closing the sieve and locking it, again not relevant.\n\nPage 116 covers storing the machine, cleaning, lubrication. No mention of spreading height.\n\nPage 117 discusses storage methods, cleaning, and preservation. Again, nothing about height during spreading without GEOCONTROL.\n\nSo, after going through all these pages, I don't see any specific information about the maximum height the fertilizer flies when using the spreader without the GEOCONTROL headland. The context focuses more on settings, adjustments, and procedures for different spreading methods but doesn't provide a direct answer to the height.\n</think>\n\nThe exact maximum height the fertilizer flies during spreading without the GEOCONTROL headland is not specified in the provided context.",

Hmm, I don't recall seeing \"seven-sided\" mentioned in the context provided. The closest term used is \"one-sided,\" which refers to methods where only one side of the field is spread, typically the edge or a tramline.\n\nI should double-check the pages related to boundary spreading. Page 106 discusses border spreading with two different functions: ExactLine and the hydraulic border spreading plate. It mentions that when using the ExactLine, you drive along the first sprayer tramline, while the plate allows for one-sided spreading from the field edge inward.\n\nThere's no mention of a seven-sided approach in any of these pages. The methods described are either one-sided or involve multiple passes but still within the context of boundary control.

Looking further, in page 120, there's a section on disconnecting the machine safely. It lists several steps: ensuring all parts are safe, checking the environment, wearing safety gloves and shoes, placing the machine on a stable, firm surface, not standing between the tractor and machine while using the power lift, operating it slowly, positioning the power lift so it won't lower accidentally, maintaining enough distance between parts.\n\nAdditionally, page 119 talks about disconnecting safely, including checking that nobody is around, wearing protective gear, placing the machine on a straight, firm surface, not standing between the tractor and machine while using external power lifts, operating the power lift carefully, positioning it to prevent release or lowering, and keeping enough distance.\n\nPutting this together, the measures for road transport when stopping work include ensuring the machine is stable, securing it properly, checking for safety around, wearing protective clothing, and following specific steps to avoid accidents.\n</think>\n\nWhen stopping work for road transport, ensure the machine is securely placed on a firm, level surface.

It specifically says, \"Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion.\"\n\nNow, I need to see if there's any information about how coastal vs. inland regions affect this. Scanning through the pages, I don't see any direct mention of geographical locations affecting corrosion rates. The context talks about general maintenance tips but doesn't specify environmental factors like humidity or salt content found in coastal areas.\n\nSince there's no explicit information linking coastal vs. inland regions to corrosion rates, I can't provide a precise answer based on the given text. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe rate of corrosion on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD is influenced by fertilizers and other salts, but there's no information provided about how coastal vs. inland regions affect this rate. \n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the detailed technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system. Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I remember that the context includes several pages related to the machine's safety, maintenance, and operation. But since the question is about ISOBUS communication protocols, I should focus on sections that mention ISOBUS or IsoMatch.\n\nLooking at Page 33, it talks about the IsoMatch universal ISOBUS terminal. It mentions that the IsoMatch control box can operate multiple functions simultaneously, like the main screen of the machine and a separate program. It also notes that the control box uses an ISOBUS communication protocol suitable for tractors with or without ISOBUS systems.\n\nOn Page 34, it discusses the IsoMatch Grip accessory, which is a control unit operated centrally with one handle. It doesn't directly mention technical specifications of the communication protocols but does talk about the control box's functions.\n\nPage 35 again refers to the IsoMatch control box and its features, like having a divided color screen for operating programs. No specific protocol details here.\n\nMoving on to Page 36, it lists technical specifications for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD machine, including things like sound levels, tractor power, and electrical supplies required (1 power socket for ISOBUS control box). It also mentions that tractors without ISOBUS can be equipped with an IsoMatch universal terminal.\n\nPage 37 discusses the sound levels of the tractor when using different attachments. No direct mention of communication protocols here.\n\nPage 38 is about pre-use inspections and assembly, mentioning the use of ISOBUS terminals but not specifics.\n\nPage 39 talks about control box assembly, including connecting via CAN cables. It mentions that IsoMatch can be used with tractors equipped with ISOBUS or non-ISOBUS systems, using an adaptor cable set.\n\nPage 40 is about console assembly for the control box, again without specific protocol details.\n\nPage 41 discusses IsoMatch terminals on ISO and non-ISO tractors. It explains how IsoMatch connects via CAN cables to standard tractor connections or with adaptors for non-ISOBUS tractors.\n\nPage 42 mentions hopper extensions and covers, not relevant here.\n\nPage 43 is about parking wheels and vanes, no help.\n\nPage 44 talks about vanes for large working widths, again not relevant.\n\nPage 45 discusses mud guards and linkage frames, nothing on communication protocols.\n\nPage 46 is about coupling shaft connections, specifically mentioning ExactLine for border spreading. Not helpful.\n\nPage 47 mentions the hydraulic border spreading plate, also not relevant.\n\nSo, from this, I gather that IsoMatch systems use ISOBUS communication protocols. The context doesn't specify different versions of ISOBUS but does mention that IsoMatch can connect to tractors with or without ISOBUS using appropriate cable sets.\n\nI don't see any detailed technical specifications about bandwidth capabilities or specific protocol versions beyond the general mention of ISOBUS compatibility. Therefore, I can't provide exact details on different ISOBUS versions compatible with IsoMatch Tellus.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide detailed technical specifications or bandwidth capabilities for different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system. It only mentions that IsoMatch systems use ISOBUS communication protocols and can operate with tractors equipped with or without ISOBUS systems using appropriate cable sets.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many hours the IsoMatch Tellus can operate before flattening a typical tractor battery if left switched on with the engine off. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that the context covers various safety instructions, maintenance tips, and technical specifications of the machine. The question is specifically about the IsoMatch Tellus control box's impact on the tractor's battery.\n\nLooking through the pages, I find that Page 39 mentions something about the control box using power, which could flatten the battery if left engaged. It says that unintended functions can be activated while in the danger area and also notes that the control box uses power, potentially flattening the tractor battery.\n\nPage 33 talks about the IsoMatch Tellus being a compact ISO control system with various functions, including a main switch on the upper left. It's important to note that the control box should be switched off when not in use to prevent unintended activation and battery drain.\n\nOn Page 39 again, it specifically warns: \"If the box is engaged, unintended functions can be activated while you are in the danger area. Moreover, the control box uses power, as a result of which the tractor battery could be flattened.\"\n\nSo, putting this together, the IsoMatch Tellus control box draws power even when the engine is off, and if left switched on (engaged), it can drain the tractor's battery. The context doesn't provide specific hours but mentions that leaving it engaged can cause battery flattening.\n\nTherefore, the answer should indicate that it can operate until the battery is drained, which depends on how long it's left switched on with the engine off.\n</think>\n\nThe IsoMatch Tellus control box draws power from the tractor's battery when switched on. If left engaged with the engine off, it will drain the battery until it is fully discharged. The context does not specify a precise number of hours but indicates that this can lead to battery flattening.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

It seems like this is the only place where wind speed is mentioned, but it doesn't give a specific limit.\n\nI don't see any other references to wind speed in the context provided.

However, towards the end, specifically on Page 93, there's a section titled \"Preparing the machine to be transported\" under \"Driving on the road.\"\n\nIn that section, it mentions several checks that should be done before transporting the tractor and machine. One of these is checking whether the tractor and machine are roadworthy. It also talks about lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes being properly attached and functioning.\n\nThen, moving further down, under \"Preparing the machine to be transported,\" there's a list of specific steps. One of them is: \"Check all folding parts and their locking devices: \u00b7 hopper cover, \u00b7 ExactLine, \u00b7 hydraulic border spreading plate.\" So these are components that might need attention before transport.\n\nAnother point is about setting all parts of the machine and the tractor to transport mode. It specifically mentions the PTO shaft, hydraulics, wheels, and electric system being set to transport mode. This likely includes tire pressure settings as part of preparing for transport.\n\nHowever, I don't see any specific mention of tire pressure in the context provided. The closest is that all parts are set to transport mode, which might involve adjusting things like tire pressure, but without explicit numbers, it's unclear.\n\nGiven that the question asks for a specific range and there's no direct information about tire pressure in transport mode, I should probably respond with \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended tire pressure range for transport mode is not explicitly provided in the given context. \n\n**Answer:** Not found in context",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for the application rate. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFrom the context, I see that on page 95, there's a mention of setting the spreader height to 75 cm above the ground or crops. This is important because it affects how the fertiliser is applied. The PTO shaft rpm needs to remain constant while spreading, as changing it could affect the application rate.\n\nOn page 100, during the start of spreading, it's mentioned that the driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed. It also says that the PTO shaft rpm must remain constant. This suggests that adjusting the driving speed doesn't change the PTO speed, which is crucial for maintaining the correct application rate.\n\nLooking at page 109, when using the ExactLine, the PTO shaft rpm is set to 75% during the first pass and then increased back to 100%. This adjustment likely compensates for the spreading pattern overlap. The driving speed here is decreased to match the PTO speed reduction, which helps in maintaining even distribution.\n\nOn page 110, when using the hydraulic border spreading plate, it's mentioned that the working width can be adjusted by changing the plate setting. However, there's no direct mention of speed adjustment here, but earlier sections about ExactLine suggest a 25% reduction.\n\nPutting this together, during border spreading, especially with ExactLine, the driving speed is reduced to 75% (a 25% decrease) to match the PTO shaft rpm reduction, ensuring that the application rate remains consistent. This method prevents over or under application by maintaining the correct spreader operation.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading is **25%**, achieved by reducing the driving speed from 100% to 75%. This adjustment ensures the PTO shaft rpm remains constant, compensating for the application rate and maintaining consistent spreading.",

Starting from page 94 onwards, it's all about operating instructions and safety tips, which don't directly answer my question.\n\nMoving to page 97, it talks about tramline patterns and using GEOCONTROL. Page 98 mentions a checklist for settings but doesn't specify distances. Page 99 discusses hydraulic border spreading plates but again, no specific distance mentioned.\n\nPage 100 is about starting spreading, mentioning driving to the first tramline. It says to drive half the working width from the field edge when using ExactLine. So, if the working width is X meters, the first path is at (1/2)X meters from the edge.\n\nContinuing through pages 101-103, they cover various aspects of spreading but don't add new info on distances. Page 104 discusses GEOCONTROL headland function, which might relate to ExactLine. It says to drive along the field boundary while using the border spreading plate and then fill the field with injections on the sprayer tramline.\n\nPage 105 talks about over and underdosing, not relevant here. Pages 106-107 cover one-sided boundary spreading methods but again, no specific distance is given beyond what's mentioned in page 100.\n\nPage 108 discusses ExactLine setup, which requires driving half the working width from the field edge. So, the first path is at (1/2)X meters. Page 109 and 110 talk about driving patterns without adding new info.\n\nPage 111 mentions stopping work but doesn't relate to distances. Pages 112-113 cover failure and stoppage procedures, not relevant. Page 114 discusses damage and storage, which isn't helpful.\n\nFinally, pages 115-123 cover maintenance and storage tips, none of which mention the specific distance for the first path beyond what's already noted in page 100.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the context specifies that when using ExactLine or similar methods, the first pass is driven at half the working width from the field edge. Therefore, the distance tolerance is (1/2)X meters.\n</think>\n\nThe distance tolerance for the first path in border spreading is **half the working width** from the field edge, which is calculated as (1/2)X meters, where X represents the total working width of the field.\n\nAnswer: The distance is half the working width, so it's (1/2)X meters.",

On page 119, it talks about disconnecting the machine safely, mentioning that the parking support must be placed on a straight, firm surface. It also warns not to stand between the tractor and machine while using the power lift, which could cause accidents.\n\nOn page 120, there's a tip about lowering the power lift if possible by placing the spreader on a firm, stable ramp, like a pawl. This suggests that the parking support might need extra stabilization on slopes.\n\nPage 121 discusses preparation for winter storage and mentions cleaning and lubrication to prevent corrosion. It also advises using a high-pressure cleaner carefully to avoid damaging parts.\n\nPage 117 talks about storing the machine, emphasizing wearing protective clothing and avoiding contact with fertiliser.

But the question is about spring season preparation. Hmm, maybe similar steps are needed but perhaps adjusted for the current condition of the machine after winter.\n\nPage 117 mentions storing the machine by cleaning and applying preservative grease to metal parts. It also says to avoid contact with fertiliser and other materials, wearing protective clothing. So, cleaning is part of it, but there's more.\n\nOn page 121 again, it repeats the same points about lubrication, cleaning, and re-lubricating for winter storage. But since we're talking about spring, maybe the focus shifts a bit. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention spring-specific tasks beyond what's in preparation for winter.\n\nWait, looking at page 123, it says to repair damage safely before continuing work. So, checking for any damage from winter storage is important. Also, on page 124, it lists oil and grease quantities, which are part of maintenance.\n\nPage 125 has maintenance intervals, including things like checking bolts and nuts after the first operating hour and weekly. That's relevant because after winter, the machine might have been idle, so these checks are necessary.\n\nPage 126 talks about lubricating points, specifically coupling shafts, discharge bushings, and actuators. So, ensuring all these are greased properly is part of preparation.\n\nOn page 127, it details adding oil to connectors and mentions using a suitable lubricant to prevent corrosion. This is important for the hydraulic system's health.\n\nPage 128 also discusses steel tightening torques, which ensures that bolts and nuts aren't loose, preventing damage or accidents.\n\nPutting this together, beyond cleaning and lubrication, preparing the machine in spring would involve checking for damage, ensuring all grease points are filled, checking hydraulic systems, tightening connections, and verifying maintenance intervals. Also, applying preservative grease to metal parts to prevent corrosion during storage.\n\nI should make sure the answer is concise and includes these steps without adding unnecessary details.\n</think>\n\nTo prepare the machine at the start of the spring season beyond cleaning and lubrication, ensure all grease points (coupling shaft, discharge bushings, actuators) are lubricated.

For the central gearbox gearboxes of the spreading discs, it says to use EP00/000 gear grease, which is 2 x 0.25 litres. Then, for the coupling shaft profiled tubes, it mentions using Shell Rodina 2 or Castrol GS2 or equivalent MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90.\n\nNow, moving on to page 126, which talks about Lubricating points. It says all lubricating nipples can be filled with a universal grease type. There's also a reference to the Oil and grease content on page 124, so I should check that again.\n\nOn page 124, under \"Oil and grease content,\" it specifies:\n- Central gearbox gearboxes: EP00/000 gear grease\n- Coupling shaft profiled tubes: Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2, or equivalent MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90\n\nBut for the lubricating nipples, page 126 just says \"universal grease.\" Since it's a universal grease, I need to see if there's a specific type mentioned elsewhere. However, in the context provided, only EP00/000 and Shell Rodina 2/Castrol GS2 are specified.\n\nWait, but the question is about the type of universal grease for all lubricating nipples. The context doesn't explicitly state a single universal grease type beyond \"universal grease.\" It seems like it's referring to a general-purpose grease that can be used in various applications, but without more specifics, I might have to infer based on common types.\n\nHowever, looking again at page 124, the coupling shaft uses MIL-L-2105C, which is a specific type. Maybe the universal grease refers to something similar or a general recommendation. But since the context doesn't specify beyond \"universal grease,\" perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the type of universal grease recommended, and from page 126, it says all nipples can be filled with a universal grease type. Since there's no further detail in the context, the answer is likely \"Shell Rodina 2\" or \"Castrol GS2\" as they are examples given for other parts.\n\nWait, but those are specific to the coupling shaft, not necessarily the universal grease for all nipples.

The question specifically mentions the \"dosing mechanism,\" which from the context seems to be part of the spreader system used for applying fertiliser or other materials.\n\nOn page 134, it talks about checking and setting the position of the dosing mechanism. It says that the dosing mechanism must be mounted exactly in the middle above the spreading discs. There's a mention of an agitator axle and a seal ring, and some steps involving loosening bolts and moving parts to adjust the positioning.\n\nThe key part here is about how to adjust the dosing mechanism. The context mentions using fastening knobs and nuts on the dosing mechanism attached to the hopper. It says to turn the nuts on the 4 fastening bolts a few times to loosen them, then move the dosing plate so that the distance between the agitator axle and the seal ring is the same on all sides.\n\nNow, looking at the tools involved, it doesn't explicitly say whether a flathead or Phillips screwdriver is used. However, in agricultural machinery, many components are designed to be adjusted with standard tools. Flathead screwdrivers are commonly used for tightening bolts and nuts that don't have specific drive types.\n\nSince there's no mention of Phillips screws being required for this particular adjustment, it's likely that a flathead screwdriver is the optimal choice. Phillips screws are typically used in applications where the screw head is designed to be inserted into a corresponding slot, which isn't indicated here. The context focuses on bolts and nuts rather than specific screw types.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, a flathead screwdriver would be more appropriate for adjusting the dosing mechanism without causing damage or requiring specialized tools.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal screwdriver type for adjusting the dosing mechanism is **flathead**. This is because the context does not specify Phillips screws being required and agricultural machinery often uses flathead screwdrivers for such adjustments.\n\nAnswer: Flathead",

It doesn't specify the exact dimension of the crack but rather that this is an indicator of correct positioning.\n\nHmm, perhaps the context doesn't provide the exact measurement for the crack. It's more about the condition (a small crack) rather than the size in millimeters. So, maybe the answer is that the crack is a specific size, but without a number, I can't state it precisely.\n\nI should check if any other pages mention this. Page 137 talks about setting the discharge bushing height and mentions the distance between the spreading disc and the discharge bushing must be 1.0 mm. But that's a different part.\n\nWait, on page 135 again: \"If the dosing plates are mounted in the correct positions, you will see a small crack of light when the dosing openings are closed.\" It doesn't give a number, just describes it as a small crack. So, perhaps the answer is that there's no specific dimension provided, or it's considered a general condition.\n\nI think I need to respond with \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't specify the exact size of the crack in millimeters.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide a specific dimension for the \"small crack of light\" between the dosing baffles when closed. It only mentions that such a crack indicates proper positioning but does not specify its size.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

        "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what type of feeler gauge material is recommended for checking the discharge bushing height. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several pages related to maintenance and troubleshooting. The question specifically mentions a \"feeler gauge\" for checking the discharge bushing height. \n\nOn Page 138, it says: \"You can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately.\" So, the material of the feeler gauge isn't explicitly mentioned here. However, in other parts of the context, like Page 131, it mentions using appropriate tools for hydraulic system checks, but again, no specific material is given.\n\nSince the question is about the type of material, and I don't see any details specifying whether it's metal or plastic, I might have to infer based on standard practices. Typically, feeler gauges are made of materials like stainless steel or nickel, as they need to be durable and precise. However, without explicit information in the context, I can't be certain.\n\nGiven that the context doesn't provide specifics about the material, the safest answer would be \"Unknown\" because there's no direct information provided on the type of feeler gauge material recommended.\n</think>\n\nThe specific type of feeler gauge material is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**Unknown**",

That seems a bit unusual because sails are typically used in boating or similar applications. But according to the context, it says \"The hopper cover protects the fertiliser in the hopper against humidity and dirt.\" Then, it specifically mentions \"The sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening.\"\n\nSo, the material used is referred to as \"sail,\" which I assume is a specific type of fabric or covering. Now, regarding UV resistance, the context doesn't explicitly mention anything about UV protection for the hopper cover or sail material. It only talks about protecting against humidity and dirt.\n\nI should check if there's any other part that might discuss materials or durability.
