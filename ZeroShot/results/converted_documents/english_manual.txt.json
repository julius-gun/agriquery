Remove the key from the ignition to prevent the tractor from being started unintentionally while you are in the danger zone. This especially applies when changing the settings or while maintenance and repairs are carried out.\nKeep clear from a running machine\nFertiliser is spread over a great distance during operation. Ensure that nobody comes within working reach of the machine during operation. Do not come into the working area before all parts of the machine are standing still.\nThe power lift must only be operated outside of the danger zone\nIn the area between the tractor and the machine, there is a danger of being pinned down by the power lift. The power lift must therefore only be engaged from beyond the danger zone. Secure the tractor with the parking brake and wheel chocks to ensure it would not roll away.\nDo not approach the machine until it has come to a complete standstill\nThe rotating parts of the machine never come to an immediate halt, they always wind down. The moving parts of a machine are not always visible. Do not approach the machine until all moving parts have come to a complete halt.\nNever go underneath an elevated, unsecured machine\nThe machine or parts of the machine could accidentally fall due to waning pressure, for instance. Always place the machine on proper supports if you have to work under the machine!"

Operating the machine from the tractor will keep you out of harm's way. Other people should not be in the immediate vicinity of the machine and the tractor. Those who are within the working area and the danger zone could be injured.\nCheck the immediate vicinity\nCheck the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.\nNever stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.\nWork with a closed cabin\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.\nCheck the state of the tractor and machine\nOnly work with the tractor and machine if they are in good condition Always check that:\n· all lighting, safety and warning provisions must be mounted correctly and be in good working condition,\n· the lifting and pulling capabilities must be sufficient,\n see paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines« on page 13,\n· the tractor must be suitable for the machine, such as in the area of stability, engine capability, axle load and total weight,\n· it is sufficient for the working with the machine and for transport.\nAdhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or machine damage.\n See the tractor's technical details."

This should be a multi-purpose ABC rated extinguisher with a 5 kg capacity, approved by the appropriate authority. Mount this on the tractor and/or on the machine. Fire could damage the machine and cause injury.\nUse active carbon filters\nHarmful gasses and mists could enter the air duct of the tractor while it is in use. An active carbon filter should therefore be mounted in the air ventilation of the tractor. Harmful materials could cause serious personal injury.\nEnsure the tractor is safe when leaving it\nNever leave the tractor without:\n· switching off the PTO shaft,\n· switching off the electronic control system,\n· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,\n· switching off the tractor engine,\n· the key must be removed from the ignition,\n· engage the parking brake of the tractor.\nLeaving the tractor unsafe could create dangerous situations that could lead to injury.\nResponding to problems\nIn the event of operational problems you should:\n· stop immediately,\n· switch the tractor and machine off,\n· attend to the problem or call in the assistance of an expert.\nNever use the tractor in a closed area\nThe tractor must never be used in a closed area. Exhaust fumes collect without being noticed. Exhaust fumes can cause serious or deadly injuries.\nThe following is of importance with the loading machine to ensure safe operation:\n· the maximum load of the machine,\n· the maximum axle load of the tractor,\n· weight distribution over the axles,\n· and the carry load per wheel.\nAt least 20% own weight from the tractor must rest on the front axle and 45% on the rear axle in order to maintain good manoeuvrability. Check if these conditions are adhered to before purchasing a machine! Adhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions!

Each has eight by a dosing plate on top of the spreading disc. Both of the dosing\nvanes. They are mounted level so that the fertiliser is spread over the land in a constant horizontal flow. The spreading quantity is regulated plates are located right on top of the discharge bushings. The fertiliser falls on the turning spreading disc. The discharge point is determined by the opening in the discharge bushing behind the vanes. This means that the fertiliser granules are already turning before they come into contact with the vanes on the spreading disc. This prevents granules from breaking apart and becoming powdery. The agitator mounted below in the hopper provides for a constant stream of fertiliser dust, seeds or granules to the dosing opening(s). Moreover, the agitator prevents the chunks of fertiliser from blocking\none or more dosing openings.\nGetting familiar with the machine\n23"

Moreover, it is possible to shut 2 of the 3 dosing openings so that the application rate can also be set precisely with a low flowrate, while the risk of blockages remains limited.\nThe machine is equipped with two actuators, which service a dosing plate each, in order to set the application rate. This actuator can open the dosing plate in every required position. In this way, accurate dosing independent of the driving speed is possible. It is also possible to control the dosing setting with external sensors, for example, a nitrogen sensor.\n See paragraph »Application rate« on page 66.\nThe actuators are controlled by means of the spreader software. By means of weight sensors, the spreader continuously measures the discharge volumes and corrects it as needed with the application rate. If you want to close on one side, you can choose the function on the control box, after which one of the two dosing plates will be closed immediately.\nNormal dosing\nFor precise dosing over a wide range of settings, a spreader with 3 openings is applied per disc.\nFine application\nThe spreader is equipped with a fine spreader as standard equipment to spread low application rates. This fine spreader can be adjusted with a lever per dosing unit.\nLow application rates require a small dosing opening. In order\n· to finely adjust the settings\n· and to counter the blockage\na transition to the opening, which is open wider, is desirable.\n2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed when using the fine dosing setting.\nThe fertiliser now flows through one opening that is opened wider, giving an accurate, reliable flow, also at low application rate."

The discharge point setting depends on the fertiliser type and the flowrate in kg/min.\nThe letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate is given in the spreading chart. The spreading computer determines the correct setting with the input working and spreading chart data.\nSpreading pattern form\nThe spreading pattern is normally a triangle that completely overlaps. A trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate. This spreading pattern has an overlapping area of less than 100%.\nReducing working width during the pass\nThe control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.\nThe spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this.\n25"

For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.\nThe spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.\n See the software instruction manual.\nThe working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands. Field data imported from a new management system or a newly created field boundary is used for this purpose.\n[Image]\n30"

This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all. A shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.\n See the software instruction manual.\nUse spreading chart\nTo determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate, the computer needs at least 1 measuring point. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.\nTo prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes or steering, braking actions and vibrations from influencing the measured values, the machine is equipped with a reference sensor. By means of the reference sensor signal, the spreader corrects the influence of the factors mentioned.\nIf the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. Measurement accuracy declines in such a way that new automatic calibration cannot produce a better discharge curve.\n31"

Specifically tilling the site and reacting to deviating field forms or soil compositions is possible through ISOBUS communication. With GPS, various sensors and management systems are provided with the necessary information in order to control the machine optimally.\nISOBUS functionality via IsoMatch\nTractors without their own ISO terminal can work as ISO tractors with the IsoMatch control box.\nDriving speed, RPM and GPS signal on IsoMatch\nIf speed is not measured on the (trailed) machine, but via the tractor, the speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics. A special cable set is required for this.\n See paragraph »Directly to the ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection in the tractor cabin« on page 144.\nThe same applies for the PTO shaft RPM. The extra sensor is available for this purpose.\nThe GPS signal can also be used via the RS 232 on the control box. This is required for the GEOCONTROL functionality.\n Also, refer to the manual that comes with your control box.\nAdapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set\nIf the tractor does not have an ISOBUS communication, it can be added with the IsoMatch power cable set.\nHereafter, your tractor is entirely ISOBUS ready, and you can connect and operate the machine with the IsoMatch control box.\nThe driving speed of your tractor (or your trailed machine) is transmitted via the ISOBUS to the IsoMatch.\nThe \"IM Tellus Input\" cable, supplied as a standard item, can be used for other connections."

The dealer is also responsible for providing instructions for use and maintenance. He/she must also ensure that the required documents are provided, such as:\n· manual,\n· spare parts manual\n· spreading chart book,\n· testing and approval documents where required.\nIf parts are missing or have been damaged during transport, you should report that to your dealer directly on delivery.\nBefore the machine can be used, various parts and supplied accessories must be unpacked and assembled.\nTIP In addition to the assembly instructions, use the parts book to locate the parts and their positions on the machine.\n[Image]\nUse sturdy hoisting equipment\nUse the hoisting points on the machine to hook up your approved slings or hoisting chains. If the machine is hoisted incorrectly or with inferior equipment it could fall from the sling, resulting in material damage and possible physical injury.\nWork on a clean surface\nBefore you start mounting, you should clean the surface and the directly surrounding area where you place the machine. A machine that is placed on pieces of packaging or parts, may slide away during mounting with material damage and possibly physical injury as a result.\nAccessories and parts must be correctly mounted\nAssemble accessories and parts according to specifications and attach them only for their designated purpose; ensure that it is locked correctly. Accessories and parts which are not fastened securely could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.\nTighten all bolts and nuts\nCheck that all the nuts and bolts are well set. Check this again after one hour of use\n· after delivery and\n· after maintenance or repairs have been carried out.\nNever check holes to be lined up by inserting your fingers\nUse a pin. Movement of the machine or parts may cause severe physical injury."

A distribution meter comes with every spreader. This meter has 4 sections, with seven parts. The seven have different mesh width that divide the fertiliser granules, based on their diameters.\nDistribution of 0-70-30-0 indicates none of the granules has a diameter of less than 2.0 mm, 70% have a diameter between 2.0 - 3.3 mm, 30% have a diameter between 3.3 - 4.75 mm and none is larger than 4.75 mm.\nYou should therefore do the following to determine the distribution of the fertiliser with the distribution meter:\n Fill the slot that reads 4.75 mm and close the other openings with the cover.\n Close the distribution meter with the cover and keep it on its side.\n Shake it for as long as no more smaller granules are falling through the sieves.\n Turn the distribution meter back up and read the content of each slot. The given percentages should add up to 100%. It could be necessary to round the readings off with small and round granules.\n Repeat the steps above three times and then determine the average distribution.\nTIP Fill the fraction meter from another part of the hopper in order to obtain a good average as the larger granules tend to roll to the outer part of the hopper.\nTIP Clean the seven parts regularly in order to prevent them from getting blocked.\n[Image]\nThe last figure indicates how you can read the following distribution: 0-70-30-0\nIndication with regard to the distribution:\n· If the diameter of 10% or more of the fertiliser granules is smaller than 2.0 mm the fertiliser type would be difficult to spread, especially with large working widths. This could result in a less than optimal distribution and could damage the crops.\n· If the diameter of 80 - 100% of the fertiliser granules is between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertiliser would be good to spread, irrespective of the size of the remaining granules.\n· If the diameter of 20% or more of the fertiliser granules is greater than 4.75 mm it would be difficult for optimum distribution. This could lead to damage to the crops as the granules could make holes in the leaves of the crop.\n59"

This will also provide information about additional types of fertiliser that have been tested recently. You can make use of the online spreading chart service as an alternative to the spreading chart book. You must enter the characteristics of the fertiliser, your working width, application rate, driving speed and the type of fertiliser. You will then receive advice from the website for setting your spreader: dosing setting, discharge point, flowrate, vane combination and angle of the spreader.\nMethods for adjusting the spreader can be found at:  chapter »Setting the spreader« on page 62.\nAlso check the advice given on the online spreading chart service. Do a calibration test to check the dosing setting. Then check the spreading pattern with a tray test.\n See paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.\nYou can reach the spreading chart service as follows:\n Go to the website of the Kverneland Group: http://www.Kvernelandspreadingcharts.com.\n The various languages are given at the top of the page.\n Start the spreading chart service and complete the details required.\n The spreading chart service will then request that you select a product with comparable characteristics.\n The spreading chart service will then indicate the settings for your spreader.

Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with the materials could lead to personal injury.\nBe careful that nothing gets jammed\nIt is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully while making adjustments:\n· switch the tractor off and remove the keys from the ignition,\n· engage the parking brake of the tractor,\n· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with filling, adjusting or testing,\n· Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured spreader,\n· Comply carefully with the instructions.\nFriction with these materials could cause physical injury.\nProtecting the environment\nSpreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.\nWork with a closed cabin\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets.

This could for instance be the distance between the sprayer tramlines.\nIn the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system, look for the page that shows the desired working width of the fertiliser type with the most similar properties.\nVarious types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.\nIf you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres. Enter the actual working width into the control system so that the selected application rate is correctly distributed.\nThe working width is adjusted with:\n· the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and\n· the discharge point.\nThe working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox. Which terminal (turtle or hare) you need to use is listed in the (online) spreading chart and depends on the desired working width.\n Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n Detach the coupling shaft from the machine.\n Attach the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point.\nINDICATION\nINDICATION\nCoupling shaft connection\n[Image]\npoint\n[Image]\n[Image]\nSlow/tortoise connection point\n64"

The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.\nThe discharge point can be set between positions C to U . The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point , of the spreading chart.\nAlways check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).\n see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.\nIn the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.\nYou can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.\nTIP Set the spreader angle before you fill the hopper. It is easier to adjust the top link if the hopper is empty.\nCheck the position again after the hopper has been filled!\nIf the inclination is at 4 o of 8 o , the spreader area slides further behind the spreader.\n In the machine data screen, increase the length B by 10% or 20% at 4 o or 8 o .\n Please refer to the software instruction manual for the procedure.\nThe (online) spreading chart shows the rpm of the spreading discs as well as the rpm of the PTO shaft. The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.\nThe PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.

In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.\nThe control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.\n See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.\nLook for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:\n Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.\n The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.\n The given values are to be entered in the control system.\nIf the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate. If the selected driving speed is not given, use the settings closest to the selected driving speed.\n66"

With a low application rate and/or a low driving speed the dosing openings are only opened a slight bit so that very little fertiliser would stream through the dosing openings of the spreader. This could easily cause blockage, which would lead to a bad spreading pattern and possible damage the crops.\nWe therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min .\nThe flowrate with a specific working width, application rate and driving speed is given in the fourth column of the spreading chart.\nIf very low application rates (less than 25 kg/ha) are to be distributed, e.g. only a few kilograms per hectare, the control system cannot perform automatic calibrations. The distributed weight is too small to accurately adjust the application rate.\nClose 2 of the 3 dosing openings to prevent blockages. The remaining opening must be further opened as the application rate with the constant flowrate would be three times as much.\nThe handle to close 2 of the 3 fine dosing openings is located at the outside of the spreading disc, above a similar handle for the discharge point. You will find the indications on top of the fine application handle for the number of dosing openings: 3 open holes for standard dosing and 1 open hole and 2 thick holes for fine application.\n Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n Pull the hand-grip of the fine application lever out.\n Set the fine application handle until the arrow on the hand-grip indicates the desired position.\n Let go of the hand-grip and check if the fine application handle is locked.\n Set the fine application lever on the other spreading disc in the same way to the same position.\n67"

Keep the axle load, load capacity of the wheels and the total weight of the tractor in mind, as well as the minimum axle load of the tractor.  See also paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted\nmachines« on page 13.\nINDICATION If the weight should increase the filled spreader could fall backwards!  Set the spreader level length wise after it has been filled.\nINDICATION\nIf the spreader is filled during the spreading process, e.g. from an auger riding alongside the vehicle the automatic calibration must be switched off. With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage.\n75"

Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.\nBe careful that nothing gets jammed\nIt is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader. Work carefully:\n· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,\n· engage the parking brake of the tractor,\n· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,\n· carefully follow the instructions given.\nFriction with these materials could cause physical injury.\nThe test should be performed on your own. Operate the machine on your own!\nDangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.\nProtecting the environment\nSpreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.\nPTO shaft rotates after disengaging\nAfter switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.\nWork with a closed cabin\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.\nA tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.\nTray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.\nWe recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.\n[Image]"

With boundary track spreading, drive down the first sprayer tramline from the field edge and spray in the direction of the border.\nWe advise you to spread the site first before you spread the borders. During border spreading, the control system does not perform any automatic calibration, so it cannot accurately determine the correct dosing setting for the required application rate. Consequently, the application rate can deviate from the required application rate during border spreading.

Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!\nDo not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars\nPrevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working above the permitted pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.\nKeep your distance from the hydraulics during inspecting and test running\nUse a stick to bend the hydraulic hoses when checking them for leakage. That way you will keep at sufficient distance. Oil jets or hoses that snap back may cause serious physical injury due to the prevailing pressure and temperature.\nWork safely on the hydraulic system\nThe hydraulic system could be under high pressure. Do not work on the hydraulic system without:\n· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,\n· switching off the electronic control system,\n· switching the tractor off,\n· the key must be removed from the ignition,\n· engage the parking brake of the tractor,\n· using the proper tools,\n· wear safety glasses, gloves and shoes.\nWorking in an unsafe manner on the hydraulic system could lead to injury and damage to the machine. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately! There is also the risk of infection!\nBefore operating the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage.\nRegularly inspect the hydraulic system (hoses, pipes, connections). All hoses, piping and connecting points must be checked regularly, but at least once a year, by an expert for leakages or visible damage! The lifetime of a hose should be 6 years maximum (see the production date on the hoses).\nDamaged or old parts must be replaced with new ones that comply with the technical specifications of the manufacturer of the machine. Damage to the hydraulic system could lead to injury.\n131"

Replace hoses if the following is detected during inspection:\n· damage to the exterior up to the armouring (such as abrasion marks, cuts and tears),\n· the exterior becoming brittle (tears in the hose),\n· distortion not normal for the pattern of the hose while under pressure, as well as without pressure or with bends, e.g. layers pealing off and blisters forming,\n· leakages,\n· not mounted as per requirements,\n· damage or distortion of the hose block, which would compromise the strength of the block or the connection between the hose and the regulating block,\n· hose coming out of the connectors,\n· corrosion of the connector which would compromise the function and strength,\n· exceeding the storage and the operating limits.\nOnly use original parts when replacing hoses. Hoses must be placed and mounted in the proper way. Be careful not to change the connections. Replaced hoses must be suitable to the permitted work pressure and be resistant to chemical, mechanical and thermal loads. Only use hose clamps made from stainless steel.\n Run the hydraulic control valves until all the cylinders are engaged.\n Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.\n Take the pressure off the hydraulic system.\n Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n Disengage the machine.\n See paragraph »Disconnecting the machine« on page 119.\n Demount the connectors with the proper tools.\n Collect the oil that drips from the cylinders and the hoses.\n Mount new hoses and put them so that they would not get pinched.\n Dispose of the collected oil as required by national legislation.\nOperate the hydraulic control valves of the tractor very carefully at first after replacing the hoses as there could still be pockets of air in the pipes! Open and close all the hydraulic control valves a few times before you start working."

Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.\nBe careful that nothing gets jammed\nIt is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting and checking the spreader.\nWork safely while checking and adjusting:\n· switching off the electronic control system,\n· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,\n· engage the parking brake of the tractor,\n· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,\n· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,\n· carefully follow the instructions given.\nFriction with these materials could cause physical injury.\nThe agitator axle is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent fertiliser granule loss along the agitator axle. The seal must be replaced every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours. Only work on a clean machine with an empty hopper.\n Set the fine application handle to the normal dosing setting.\n Start the tractor and engage the control box.\n Activate the empty hopper function.\n Please refer to the software instruction manual\n Wait until both actuators are completely extended and the dosing units are completely open.\n Place the machine on the ground or on firm supports on a firm, level ground.\n Switch the electronic control system and the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor."
