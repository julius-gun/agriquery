Dosing units closed for too  long with the PTO shaft running\n      3: Right agitator grinds\n      4: Average quality fertiliser. 80% of the gran- ules with a diameter between\n        2.0 - 4.75  mm\n      5: Blend of fertiliser types used. A blend can  become unmixed again or types\n        of fertil- iser could contain varying spreading qual- ities\n      6: New type of fertiliser spread with the  same settings as the previous type.\n        Qual- ity varies greatly between types.\n      7: Use of wrong spreading chart\n      8: 'Working with unfavourable weather con- ditions: high levels of humidity,\n        rain, heat  or high wind speeds (> 5 m/sec)'\n      9: Incorrect overlapping of the spreading  pattern\n      10: Horizontal/vertical settings of the machine  not correct\n      11: Spreader not set to the correct height\n      12: Working width incorrect\n      13: Worn or missing vanes\n      14: Tyre pressure on the left and right not the  same\n      15: The setting mechanism of the discharge  point is not set well\n      16: The dosing mechanism is not set well\n    Solution:\n      0: Contact your supplier. Update the storage area. Spread with smaller working\n        widths as far  as possible\n      1: Check the PTO shaft speed and the cou- pling shaft mounting point\n      2: Switch the PTO shaft off after closing the  dosing units. Check the agitator\n        for damage\n      3: Spreading disc not disconnected while  border spreading with the border spread-\n        ing plate\n      4: Determine the distribution and spread  with small working widths if possible\n      5: Check the type, pattern and distribution. Spread with smaller working widths\n        as far  as possible\n      6: Determine the characteristics of the fertil- iser, look for the relevant\n        spreading chart  and set the spreader again\n      7: Determine the characteristics of the fertil- iser and select the correct\n        spreading chart\n      8: Only work under good weather conditions\n      9: Always set the driving tracks before  spreading\n      10: Check if the machine is standing level  horizontally and vertically.\n      11: Check and set to the correct working  height (75 cm above the crops or soil)\n      12: Check the discharge point letter and the  PTO shaft RPM\n      13: Check the vanes\n      14: Check the tyre pressure\n      15: Perform the »Checking and setting the  discharge point setting mechanism«\n      16: Perform the »Checking and setting the  dosing mechanism«\n    Pag e:\n      0: 57,  59,  64\n      1: 46,\n      2: ''\n      3: '107'\n      4: 59,  64\n      5: 57, 59\n      6: 57,  62\n      7: 57,  60\n      8: ''\n      9: '97'\n      10: '53'\n      11: '94'\n      12: 65,\n      13: '64'\n      14: ''\n      15: '136'\n      16: '136'\n- type: TextItem\n  text: '153'\n"
