In every next chapter you will find more specific safety instructions not described here.\n\nDo not risk injury or death by ignoring good safety instructions.\n\nMany risks can happen when working with agricultural machines. Avoid accidents! Do not take risks! Be alert! Think safety! Work in safety!\n\nDisregard of the 'Safety instructions', inadequate maintenance, use of the machine other than for its intended purpose, overloading or unauthorised modification of the machine, renders the manufacturer's warranty and responsibility void.\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the function of all machine controls and the safety instructions, prior to any usage of the machine.\n\nIncorrect use of the machine may lead to dangerous situations. For this reason, you should always work carefully and never under high time pressure.\n\n## Comply with the rules\n\nIn addition to the instructions above you should comply with the following:\n\n                    - · measures to prevent accidents,\n                    - · general safety instructions, occupational health requirements and road traffic regulations,\n                    - · instructions in this manual,\n                    - · Rules regarding use, maintenance and repairs."

Remove the key from the ignition to prevent the tractor from being started unintentionally while you are in the danger zone. This especially applies when changing the settings or while maintenance and repairs are carried out.\n\n## Keep clear from a running machine\n\nFertiliser is spread over a great distance during operation. Ensure that nobody comes within working reach of the machine during operation. Do not come into the working area before all parts of the machine are standing still.\n\n## The power lift must only be operated outside of the danger zone\n\nIn the area between the tractor and the machine, there is a danger of being pinned down by the power lift. The power lift must therefore only be engaged from beyond the danger zone. Secure the tractor with the parking brake and wheel chocks to ensure it would not roll away.\n\n## Do not approach the machine until it has come to a complete standstill\n\nThe rotating parts of the machine never come to an immediate halt, they always wind down. The moving parts of a machine are not always visible. Do not approach the machine until all moving parts have come to a complete halt.\n\n## Never go underneath an elevated, unsecured machine\n\nThe machine or parts of the machine could accidentally fall due to waning pressure, for instance. Always place the machine on proper supports if you have to work under the machine!"

Never go underneath an elevated machine. Allow for any possible movements of the elevated machine, whether wanted or not.\n\n## Be careful of getting jammed or pinched\n\nIf the machine is engaged or operated unintentionally you could get struck in moving parts, which could lead to injury. Be extra alert when working in the vicinity of moving parts. Always keep in mind that the motor or parts of the machine could still be retaining some energy.\n\n## Read the user's manual\n\nThe instruction manual contains procedures for working correctly to ensure safe work, as well as dangers one could possibly encounter. Keep to these procedures as described and give due consideration to the safety measures in place!\n\n## Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars\n\nPrevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working with higher pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.\n\nMotor vehicles with limited speed (<40 km/h), agricultural and forestry tractors and their trailers, as well as other vehicles, must be provided with an orange triangle with a red reflector at the rear in the form of a truncated triangle."

Operating the machine from the tractor will keep you out of harm's way. Other people should not be in the immediate vicinity of the machine and the tractor. Those who are within the working area and the danger zone could be injured.\n\n## Check the immediate vicinity\n\nCheck the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.\n\nNever stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.\n\n## Work with a closed cabin\n\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.\n\n## Check the state of the tractor and machine\n\nOnly work with the tractor and machine if they are in good condition Always check that:\n\n                                        - · all lighting, safety and warning provisions must be mounted correctly and be in good working condition,\n                                        - · the lifting and pulling capabilities must be sufficient,\n                                        -  see paragraph »Calculate the axle load with tractor-mounted machines« on page 13,\n                                        - · the tractor must be suitable for the machine, such as in the area of stability, engine capability, axle load and total weight,\n                                        - · it is sufficient for the working with the machine and for transport.\n\nAdhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or machine damage.\n\n                                        -  See the tractor's technical details."

This should be a multi-purpose ABC rated extinguisher with a 5 kg capacity, approved by the appropriate authority. Mount this on the tractor and/or on the machine. Fire could damage the machine and cause injury.\n\n## Use active carbon filters\n\nHarmful gasses and mists could enter the air duct of the tractor while it is in use. An active carbon filter should therefore be mounted in the air ventilation of the tractor. Harmful materials could cause serious personal injury.\n\n## Ensure the tractor is safe when leaving it\n\nNever leave the tractor without:\n\n                                                - · switching off the PTO shaft,\n                                                - · switching off the electronic control system,\n                                                - · releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,\n                                                - · switching off the tractor engine,\n                                                - · the key must be removed from the ignition,\n                                                - · engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n\nLeaving the tractor unsafe could create dangerous situations that could lead to injury.\n\n## Responding to problems\n\nIn the event of operational problems you should:\n\n                                                - · stop immediately,\n                                                - · switch the tractor and machine off,\n                                                - · attend to the problem or call in the assistance of an expert.\n\n## Never use the tractor in a closed area\n\nThe tractor must never be used in a closed area. Exhaust fumes collect without being noticed. Exhaust fumes can cause serious or deadly injuries.\n\nThe following is of importance with the loading machine to ensure safe operation:\n\n                                                - · the maximum load of the machine,\n                                                - · the maximum axle load of the tractor,\n                                                - · weight distribution over the axles,\n                                                - · and the carry load per wheel.\n\nAt least 20% own weight from the tractor must rest on the front axle and 45% on the rear axle in order to maintain good manoeuvrability. Check if these conditions are adhered to before purchasing a machine! Adhere to maximum permissible axle loads, total weights and transport dimensions! Using a tractor which is not proper can cause serious or deadly injuries or tractor and machine damage."

In order to ensure protection of both man and machine exercise extreme caution when working at a coupling shaft other then described in this manual and/or on the instruction at the coupling shaft.\n\nModifications to and other special activities at coupling shafts are only permitted with the explicit written instruction and approval of the manufacturers of both the machine and the coupling shaft! Use the correct tools and original parts to ensure a good performance and maximum safety. The use of an incorrect coupling shaft can cause damage to the machine.\n\n## Mount the appropriate protection\n\nExternally accessible coupling shafts, the tractor's PTO shafts and machine input-axle must be equipped with appropriate guards and tubes. Working without guarding can cause serious or deadly injuries.\n\n## Replace protective coupling shaft tubes when required\n\nReplace the coupling shaft protection sleeves at the first signs of wear. Protection sleeves can wear without being noticed. Worn or damaged protection sleeves can cause serious or deadly injuries.\n\n## Protect the PTO shaft end well\n\nSlide the protection sleeve over the PTO shaft as soon as the coupling shaft has been removed. Clothing could become entangled into an unprotected PTO shaft end that could lead to serious injury.\n\n## Hydraulic oil is under high pressure\n\nNever try to stop a leak with your fingers. Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!\n\n## Disconnect the control box\n\nDisconnect the control box from the electric system as soon as no more functions are needed in order to prevent unintentional operation. Keeping the control box connect can be dangerous and can damage the machine\n\nas well as cause bodily injury.\n\n## Battery cables must be connected properly\n\nAlways disconnect the battery cable (negative pole) from the electric system when working on the machine. Connect the battery cables correctly: Positive pole first, followed by the negative pole. Always equip the positive pole with the appropriate protective cap to avoid a short circuit as this could lead to damage to the tractor and machine."

A trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate. This spreading pattern has an overlapping area of less than 100%.\n\n## Reducing working width during the pass\n\nThe control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.\n\nThe spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this."

Besides the smaller dimension with the single screen, the number of USB connections and the absence of Wlan/Wifi constitutes the biggest difference.\n\n## Many additional functions.\n\nThe latest developments in ISOBUS communication between tractor and implement and ease-of-use are all incorporated into the IsoMatch Tellus GO.\n\n## Connect the ISOBUS tractor via IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable\n\nIf your tractor is provided with a full ISOBUS connection, a connection with the 9-pins in Cab cable between your tractor and the IsoMatch Tellus GO control box is sufficient.\n\nOther connections are made via the \"Input IM Tellus\" cable, supplied as a standard item.\n\n## Quick menu navigation with the scroll wheel and additional keys\n\nA scroll wheel on the upper right of the box makes it easy to scroll\n\nthrough the menu.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IsoMatch Tellus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scroll-wheel navigation"

This is available in addition to the ISOBUS terminal such as the IsoMatch.\n\n## Handle control\n\nWhile working attention and visibility is often required to follow the work process. By locating the control buttons on the handle by touch, it will enable you to keep your eyes on the driving system control and remain focussed while driving.\n\nIf operating buttons can be located by the sense of touch reaction speed can be increased and operating mistakes avoided.\n\n## 44 functions under 11 buttons\n\nThe IsoMatch Grip has 11 function buttons and one selector that are operated with the thumb and under which there are 44 functions."

The high hitch points are for normal use, the low hitch points are used if the maximum lifting height of the tractor is not sufficient to ensure that the spreading height is 75 cm above the crop.\n\nThe low hitch points are also used when fertilising high crops, which is known as top dressing.\n\nFor further adjustments with top dressing, see\n\n paragraph »Spreading height« on page 95.\n\nThe space between the spreader and the tractor is limited as far as possible in order to keep the centre of gravity as closely to the tractor as possible. This promotes stability and the road behaviour of the tractor.

After choosing the desired fertiliser type, the working width, application rate, driving speed, dosing and discharge opening are transmitted to the spreader using the AutosetApp. The spreader then automatically gets the correct setting. Automatic adjustment of the discharge point only applies to GEOSPREAD spreaders. The same data may be transmitted to the spreader via the AutosetApp for the other weighing spreader models such as Exacta-CL EW and Exacta-TL(X). Except for the discharge opening, the spreader then has to be set manually.\n\nUsing the Kverneland Group spreading charts application, you can easily find the right settings for your spreader.\n\nThe spreading charts application gives you immediate access to the most up-to-date test results of fertiliser.\n\nIn just a few steps, the application will lead you to the correct settings for your spreader, any time of the day, wherever you want for almost any type of fertiliser.\n\nThe spreading chart application (App) can be downloaded free of charge through the Apple App Store and/or through the Google Play Store."

Wear protective clothing and safety gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with the materials could lead to personal injury.\n\n## Be careful that nothing gets jammed\n\nIt is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting the spreader.

Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.\n\n## Work with a closed cabin\n\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.\n\nSet the spreader based on the details obtained from the correct spreading chart, the desired application rate (kg/ha) and the driving speed (km/h).\n\nYou can find the methods for determining the correct spreading chart in\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  the instruction manual of the software.\n\nThe spreading chart page contains information about the fertiliser to which this chart relates.

This could for instance be the distance between the sprayer tramlines.\n\nIn the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system, look for the page that shows the desired working width of the fertiliser type with the most similar properties.\n\nVarious types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.\n\nIf you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width.

The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.\n\nThe discharge point can be set between positions C to U . The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point , of the spreading chart.\n\nAlways check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.\n\nIn the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.\n\nYou can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    - TIP Set the spreader angle before you fill the hopper. It is easier to adjust the top link if the hopper is empty.\n\nCheck the position again after the hopper has been filled!\n\nIf the inclination is at 4 o of 8 o , the spreader area slides further behind the spreader.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  In the machine data screen, increase the length B by 10% or 20% at 4 o or 8 o .\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  Please refer to the software instruction manual for the procedure.\n\nThe (online) spreading chart shows the rpm of the spreading discs as well as the rpm of the PTO shaft. The PTO speed is given, as well as the connection point to be used for the machine coupling shaft. You have to calculate the speed of the spreader discs. The actual RPM of the spreading discs is displayed on the control box screen.\n\nThe PTO shaft rpm often have to be adjusted with border spreading. When using the ExactLine and the border spreading plate, you can find the recommended PTO shaft rpm and associated spreading disc rpm in the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones. Use the connection point shown in the spreading chart.\n\nSee paragraph »Border spreading« on page 106."

In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.\n\nThe control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.\n\nLook for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  The given values are to be entered in the control system.\n\nIf the selected application rate is not given in the spreading charts, use the settings that are the closest to the selected application rate.

With a low application rate and/or a low driving speed the dosing openings are only opened a slight bit so that very little fertiliser would stream through the dosing openings of the spreader. This could easily cause blockage, which would lead to a bad spreading pattern and possible damage the crops.\n\nWe therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min .\n\nThe flowrate with a specific working width, application rate and driving speed is given in the fourth column of the spreading chart.\n\nIf very low application rates (less than 25 kg/ha) are to be distributed, e.g. only a few kilograms per hectare, the control system cannot perform automatic calibrations. The distributed weight is too small to accurately adjust the application rate.\n\nClose 2 of the 3 dosing openings to prevent blockages. The remaining opening must be further opened as the application rate with the constant flowrate would be three times as much.\n\nThe handle to close 2 of the 3 fine dosing openings is located at the outside of the spreading disc, above a similar handle for the discharge point. You will find the indications on top of the fine application handle for the number of dosing openings: 3 open holes for standard dosing and 1 open hole and 2 thick holes for fine application.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Pull the hand-grip of the fine application lever out.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Set the fine application handle until the arrow on the hand-grip indicates the desired position.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Let go of the hand-grip and check if the fine application handle is locked.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Set the fine application lever on the other spreading disc in the same way to the same position."

Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.\n\nYou can check with a manual calibration test if the preset dosing setting reaches the selected flowrate.\n\nThe calibration test is normally performed on the left spreading disc. Perform the calibration test with a filled hopper.  See also paragraph »Filling« on page 73.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Disconnect the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right.

This provides the option to spread as per requirements, e.g. through a nitrogen sensor.\n\nAn application rate that had been preset in the corresponding management system for the relevant field can also be entered through the GPS system.\n\n For the options and corresponding settings, see the user's manuals for the external system and the control box, e.g. the IsoMatch. The control system of the spreader in combination with the IsoMatch control box also transmits the application rate and working width used back to the external system.\n\nThe external system and the control system of a spreader with an IsoMatch control box communicate through a serial port with an RS 232 connection. This connection is located at the back of the control box. The occupation of pins in the 9-point RS 232 plug and the settings required are given in\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        -  the user manual of the IsoMatch control box."

Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!\n\n## Chemical reactions caused by mixing fertilisers\n\nMixing different types of fertiliser could lead to a chemical reaction whereby poisonous vapours, liquids or other materials could come about. Possible danger of explosion! This could lead to personal injury and damage to the crop and machine.\n\nOnly mix different types of fertiliser if allowed by the manufacturer(s).\n\nChemical reactions could lead to damage to the machines and personal injury.\n\n## Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier\n\nRead the safety instructions provided by the supplier and apply that. Protective clothing should be worn when necessary.\n\nDisregarding the safety instructions could result in personal injury and damage to the machine.\n\n## Use proper tools\n\nGreat volumes of material is often handled during the filling process. Use proper tools such as lifting devices when moving and filling the machine. Keep legislation concerning working conditions in mind. Work carefully and responsibly. Inferior tools can cause serious inju-\n\nries.\n\n## Only fill mounted machines\n\nNever place a machine in the ground while filling it. Always keep it in the power lift of the tractor. The machine is designed to be loaded while in a suspended state. Never park a filled machine on the ground. Filling the machine while it is on the ground could lead to damage.\n\n## Work with a closed cabin\n\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage."

With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage."

Operate the machine on your own!\n\nDangerous situations for other people could easily occur when the machine is turning and the test conducted. Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.\n\n## Protecting the environment\n\nSpreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.\n\n## PTO shaft rotates after disengaging\n\nAfter switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.\n\n## Work with a closed cabin\n\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage.\n\nA tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser as the spreader distributes it. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.\n\nTray tests can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.\n\nWe recommend that you request a specialist company to perform the tray test as they can also provide you with advice and answer your questions.\n\n<!-- image -->"

This will only be achieved if the spreader spreads with the correct spreading pattern.\n\nThis is then the reason why you have to test the spreading pattern and adjust it as required.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  See also paragraph »Full field spreading pattern« on page 28.\n\n## Operation\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  Set the spreader as per the details given in the spreading chart for the selected working width (X metre) that most closely matches the fertiliser, seeds or granules (height of the spreading disc = 75 cm above the troughs) .\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  Place the grids in the troughs.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  Place trough 1 in the middle of the tractor tracks.\n\nINDICATION Position the troughs horizontally with a spirit level!\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -  Divide the additional 6 buckets on the one side of the track over the actual working width of the spreader.\n\nThe actual width is twice the size of the effective working width!\n\nIf you want to spread over a working width of 24 metres, place the buckets at 24/6 metres = 4 metres.\n\n<!-- image -->"

You could accidentally touch control levers and cause the machine to move.\n\nOnly start working once all machine parts have stopped and the control lever have been secured. Wear safety shoes and gloves and work alone. If something gets jammed it could lead to personal injury.\n\n## Check the immediate vicinity\n\nCheck the immediate vicinity and keep a constant eye on it at the start, as well as while you are working with the machine. Familiarise yourself with the immediate vicinity. Do not start working until all people and obstacles within the working area and danger zone of the tractor and machine have been removed.\n\nNever stay or allow anyone to stay within the danger area while the machine is running! If there are people within the working area and the danger zone it could lead to injury.\n\n## Before leaving the tractor:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            - · switch the PTO shaft off,\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            - · release the pressure from the hydraulic system,\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            - · switch the electronic control system off,\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            - · switch the tractor off,\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            - · remove the key from the ignition,\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            - · engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n\nThat way you make sure that the tractor cannot be started when you are working on the machine and that the machine cannot move, which could cause severe physical injury.\n\n## PTO shaft rotates after disengaging\n\nAfter switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.\n\n## Protecting the environment\n\nSpreading a too high dose of materials outside of the field edge, especially on water surface, creates a heavy burden on the environment. Protect the environment by applying a correct application rate in a correct working manner.\n\n## Work with a closed cabin\n\nFertiliser dust can blow indoors through open windows, doors or other openings. Moreover, the sound level is higher in an open cabin. It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets. Fertiliser dust and a high sound level can cause physical damage."

You can create a (spray)track pattern for following processes.\n\n## Prevent drive errors\n\nIt is important that the spreading patterns overlap well to ensure good distribution. A difference in the overlapping is less vital with average working widths, using a triangular spreading pattern.\n\nDifferences in the spreading pattern would easily be noticed with a trapezium shape on very large working widths, in particular. The overlap of the spreading pattern is then much smaller and therefore more sensitive to mistakes.\n\nThis can be prevented by setting tramlines before hand. This can be done by setting out tramlines on the headlands and marking them with, for example, picket poles.\n\nVisibility of the from headland to headland is very important. Place additional markers in the field if necessary to ensure that the track is clearly visible.\n\nWhen controlled by the GEOCONTROL the spreader has the option of reducing the working width in order to connect the incomplete final pass with the next one."

With automatic calibration the control system weighs the dispersed quantity of fertiliser (kg) within a certain time. It also checks these values in terms of the selected, preset application rate. The distributed quantity can therefore not be correctly weighed if the hopper is filled while spreading. The weight in the hopper could even increase during the measurement period. The correction performed by the control system would be inaccurate as a result, which could lead to crop damage."

With boundary track spreading, drive down the first sprayer tramline from the field edge and spray in the direction of the border.\n\nWe advise you to spread the site first before you spread the borders. During border spreading, the control system does not perform any automatic calibration, so it cannot accurately determine the correct dosing setting for the required application rate. Consequently, the application rate can deviate from the required application rate during border spreading. By spreading the field first, the control system can determine the correct dosing setting and thus spread at the correct application rate, also during border spreading."

Secure the sieve in an open position and unlock the sieves on the outside. Jamming could cause injury.\n\n## Avoid contact with materials\n\nYou should only come into contact with the materials when cleaning the machine. Always wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves, shoes and goggles. Read and adhere to the additional safety instructions and the of the material producer. Contact with the materials could lead to injury. Contact your physician in such an event!\n\n## Explosion danger because of nitrate\n\nFertiliser that contains nitrate can create an explosion danger if it should come into contact with fire. All fertiliser remnants should therefore be removed from voids, corners, tubes and tubing before welding, cutting or grinding on the machine. An explosion will cause damage to the machine and could lead to personal injury.\n\nAdhere to all the safety precautions as described in  paragraph »Safety requirements« from page 10."

Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!\n\n## Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars\n\nPrevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working above the permitted pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.\n\n## Keep your distance from the hydraulics during inspecting and test running\n\nUse a stick to bend the hydraulic hoses when checking them for leakage. That way you will keep at sufficient distance.

In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately! There is also the risk of infection!\n\nBefore operating the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage.\n\nRegularly inspect the hydraulic system (hoses, pipes, connections). All hoses, piping and connecting points must be checked regularly, but at least once a year, by an expert for leakages or visible damage! The lifetime of a hose should be 6 years maximum (see the production date on the hoses).\n\nDamaged or old parts must be replaced with new ones that comply with the technical specifications of the manufacturer of the machine.

If the dosing openings do not close well you will loose unnecessary fertiliser and the application rate will be higher than intended with a specific dosing setting. If the baffles slide far over each other the application rate will be much lower than expected.\n\nIf the dosing plates are mounted in the correct positions, you will see a small crack of light when the dosing openings are closed.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            -  Close the spreader dosing units on the control box.

· carefully follow the instructions given.\n\nFriction with these materials could cause physical injury.\n\nThe distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be 1.0 mm .\n\nIf the distance is too great, the fertiliser does not flow through the discharge point opening onto the spreading disc but onto a random point below the discharge bushing. This results in a disrupted spreading pattern.\n\nIf the distance is too short, a full hopper may rest partly on the spreading disc, which seriously damages the machine as a result.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Attach the empty machine and raise it to working height (75 cm).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Place heavy, stable supports under the ends of the lifting arms.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  Lower the arms onto the supports.
