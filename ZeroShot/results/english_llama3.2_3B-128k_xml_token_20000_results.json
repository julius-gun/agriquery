This means that the selected application rate would be difficult to spread with a low application rate and/or a low driving speed, as the granules could cause damage to the crops. If the selected application rate is not given in the spreading chart, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected application rate. For example, if the settings given in the spreading chart for a required spreader width of 27 metres, the spreader would be difficult to spread with a high application rate and/or a high driving speed. This could lead to damage the crops. The weight of the spreader is also determined by the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox. The PTO speed and flowrate determines the spreading pattern.</text>The spreader's discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are given in the chart, the selected application rate and driving speed.

By spreading the field first, the control system will determine the correct dosing setting and thus spread at the correct application rate, also during border spreading.</answer>\nThe answer is 75% of the quantity distributed in the centre of the field.
