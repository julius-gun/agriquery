Remove any objects that could cause damage to the spreader or its components.\n4. Inspect the hopper contents for other lumps and reduce them if necessary.\n5. If you cannot remove the lump or encrusted layer, close the hopper cover.\n6. Follow the working method as described in the previous paragraph \u00bbDamage\u00ab until emptying the hopper.\n7. Remove or reduce the lump or encrusted layer if necessary.\n8. Dry the hopper and the dosing mechanism.\n9. Open the sieve clip to prevent accidental closure of the sieves, attachments, parts of the electric system, hydraulic hoses, stickers and plastic parts.\n10. Refill the spreader.\n11.
