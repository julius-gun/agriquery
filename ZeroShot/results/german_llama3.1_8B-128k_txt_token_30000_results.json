Check if the spreader is spreading evenly and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nIf you are using a mechanical spreader, such as a winged spreader, check to see if the wings are opening and closing properly.\n6. If the spreader is not spreading evenly, adjust its position or replace it with a new one.\n7. Check the spreader's condition and make any necessary repairs.\n\nIf you are using a hydraulic spreader, such as an ExactLine, check to see if the spreader is working correctly and make any necessary adjustments.\n8.
