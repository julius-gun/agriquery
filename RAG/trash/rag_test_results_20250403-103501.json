Select the type of fertiliser from the spreading chart that is closest to the type of fertiliser that you are using.

A distribution meter comes with every spreader. This meter has 4 sections, with seven parts. The seven have different mesh width that divide the fertiliser granules, based on their diameters. Distribution of 0-70-30-0 indicates none of the granules has a diameter of less than 2.0 mm, 70% have a diameter between 2.0 - 3.3 mm, 30% have a diameter between 3.3 - 4.75 mm and none is larger than 4.75 mm. You should therefore do the following to determine the distribution of the fertiliser with the distribution meter:\ndepends on the characteristics of the fertiliser, not the brand! Determine the characteristics of the fertiliser, therefore, and find the spreading chart with similar features. Use the chart, even if the brand of the fertiliser differs from the nearest comparable fertiliser! Select the spreading chart based on the characteristics of the fertiliser and not on the brand! In order to find the correct spreading chart in the spreading chart book, online spreading chart service on the website, or via the free application (App) on your mobile phones, you must collect the following physical properties of the fertiliser Â· type and pattern of the granules ï‚® see the paragraph below,Â»Determine the type and pattern of the granulesÂ« Â· distribution (= composition of granules of various sizes), ï‚® see paragraph Â»Determining distributionÂ« on page 59, Â· similar weight, ï‚® See paragraph Â»Determining similar weightÂ« on page 60. Distribution is the most vital characteristic of the fertiliser when it comes to spreading. You can make the first selection from the (online) spreading charts based on the distribution. Never use a spreading chart for another type of fertiliser, even if the distribution is very similar! You can determine which spreading chart compares the best",

This is available in addition to the ISOBUS terminal such as the IsoMatch. Handle control While working attention and visibility is often required to follow the work process. By locating the control buttons on the handle by touch, it will enable you to keep your eyes on the driving system control and remain focussed while driving. If operating buttons can be located by the sense of touch reaction speed can be increased and operating mistakes avoided. 44 functions under 11 buttons The IsoMatch Grip has 11 function buttons and one selector that are operated with the thumb and under which there are 44 functions. 35 ================================================================================ Page 36 ================================================================================ ===Page 36=== Getting familiar with the machine Technical specifications Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 1875 2550 3225 3900 0 General 1 Content of the hopper (l) 1875 2550 3225 3900 2 Filling level (cm) 122 141 160 179 3 Filling width (cm) 284 284 284 284 4 Hopper's width (cm) 290 290 290 290 5 Weight (kg) 705 735 765 795 6 Maximum load capacity (kg) 3900 7 Type of linkage pins Cat.

Working in an unsafe manner on the hydraulic system could lead to injury and damage to the machine. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately! There is also the risk of infection! Before operating the hydraulic system, check all connections and hoses for damage and leakage. Regularly inspect the hydraulic system (hoses, pipes, connections). All hoses, piping and connecting points must be checked regularly, but at least once a year, by an expert for leakages or visible damage! The lifetime of a hose should be 6 years maximum (see the production date on the hoses). Damaged or old parts must be replaced with new ones that comply with the technical specifications of the manufacturer of the machine.

Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan.

Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.\nDuring spreading, if you:\nÂ· see that a spreading disc is spreading irregularly or not at all while the dosing units are open,\nÂ· hear a loud noise,\nÂ· become aware that the machine is vibrating seriously,\nÂ· an alarm is shown on the main screen indicating that the PTO shaft is not connected, while it actually is connected,\nÂ· an alarm will appear on the main screen, indicating that the dosing units cannot be closed,\nï‚® see the software instruction manual.\nStop spreading immediately!

This happens especially when the spreader has not been thoroughly cleaned after it was last used.\nMost types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.\nÂ· When working under moist conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.\nÂ· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.\nÂ· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.\nÂ· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.\nHandle with care\nCautiously approach the machine and handle with care. There could be hot or live parts! Contact with these materials could cause physical injury.\nTo find the cause of the failure or stoppage and solve it as far as possible, proceed as follows.\nï€´ Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!\nï€´ Switch off the electronic control system.\nï€´ Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the handbrake of the tractor.\nDo not place the machine on the ground.
