This could for instance be the distance between the sprayer tramlines.\nIn the spreading chart book, via the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones with an iOs and/or Android operating system, look for the page that shows the desired working width of the fertiliser type with the most similar properties.\nVarious types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths. If a working width is not given in the spreading charts, the relevant type of fertiliser cannot be spread evenly over that width.\nIf you want to spread with a working width not given in the spreading charts, use the settings for the working width closest to the selected working width. For example: the settings given in the spreading chart for a required working width of 25 metres could, for instance, be approximated to 24 metres. Enter the actual working width into the control system so that the selected application rate is correctly distributed.\nThe working width is adjusted with:\n· the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and\n· the discharge point.\nThe working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox. Which terminal (turtle or hare) you need to use is listed in the (online) spreading chart and depends on the desired working width.\n Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n Detach the coupling shaft from the machine.\n Attach the coupling shaft to the correct attachment point.\nINDICATION\nINDICATION\nCoupling shaft connection\n[Image]\npoint\n[Image]\n[Image]\nSlow/tortoise connection point\n64<|begin_of_text|>\n===Page 65===\n\nDischarge point\nInclination\nAngle indicator\n[Image: Angle indicator]\nModification during GEOCONTROL use\nPTO shaft rpm\n[Image]\nTo be done before spreading\nIt is necessary to correctly set the discharge point in order to obtain a good spreading pattern and the correct working width. The point at which the granules or seeds come onto the spreading disc can be changed by setting the discharge point. The position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.\nThe discharge point can be set between positions C to U. The correct settings are determined on the basis of the selected application rate and the required driving speed. The position that would most likely provide the best spreading pattern is given in the third column, Discharge Point, of the spreading chart.\nAlways check the accuracy of the discharge point by conducting spreading pattern tests (tray test).\n see instructions in paragraph »Spreading pattern check (tray test)« on page 76.\nIn the (online) spreading chart, look for the Hoek spreader symbol to get advice on the angle of your spreader. The spreader is normally in the horizontal position. It may be necessary to adjust the spreader's angle with large working widths or with top dressing.\nYou can set the correct angle by adjusting the top link. There is an indicator on the spreader which displays the angle of the spreader.\nTIP Set the spread",
