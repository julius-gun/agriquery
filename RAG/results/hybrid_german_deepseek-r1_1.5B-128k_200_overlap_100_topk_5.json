So, if I understand correctly, out of the three possible dosing openings, two are closed to achieve this fine adjustment.\n\nI should make sure there's no other information suggesting otherwise. The context also talks about adjusting settings and counteracting blockages, but that doesn't change how many openings are closed during fine application. It just explains why they need to be adjusted.\n\nSo the answer is straightforward: two dosing openings are closed.\n</think>\n\nTwo dosing openings are closed during fine application.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see a section about the external system not communicating with the bedienpult (which is the computer). It mentions that the spreader uses weighcells to measure fertilizer. The computer compares these values with the set application rate and adjusts the dosing unit by opening or closing it. There's also something about using ISOBUS communication protocol for tractors with such systems.\n\nLooking further, there's a part where the ISO control system is mentioned. It says the ISO control system uses the ISOBUS protocol suitable for tractors with that connection. The spreader continues to use weighcells and the computer compares values, so maybe the ISO control system is the one doing the measurement?\n\nWait, but the question is about the system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread. The spreader itself uses weighcells, but I think the ISO control system might be the main system handling measurements. However, in the context provided, it seems like both are mentioned.\n\nI should check if there's a specific term for this system. Maybe \"ISO control system\" is the one that measures fertilizer quantity. Alternatively, perhaps \"spreader\" is the primary tool, but the question is about the system, so ISO might be the answer.\n\nWait, in the context, under 10, it says the external system doesn't communicate with the bedienpult. Then at 30, there's a mention of the spreader using weighcells. The ISO control system uses ISOBUS communication, which is mentioned again at 45. So maybe the ISO control system is the one that communicates and measures.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"ISO control system\" is the answer they're looking for. Alternatively, perhaps \"spreader\" isn't the system but a tool used by it. The question is about the system, so I think the ISO control system is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe ISO control system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread.\n\nAnswer: The ISO control system",

It mentions that tractors without their own ISO terminal can work as ISO tractors with the IsoMatch control box. That's a key point because it shows how non-ISO tractors can use ISO equipment.\n\nThe question specifically asks about transmitting driving speed to IsoMatch when the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication. I remember from the context that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, they can add an IsoMatch power cable set. \n\nLooking further down, there's a section titled \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set.\" It explains that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, you can install the IsoMatch power cable set. This allows the tractor to be connected and operate through the IsoMatch control box.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the process involves installing the IsoMatch power cable set on the tractor, which then enables transmission of driving speed via the ISO bus to IsoMatch. The context also mentions that this works for both the tractor's electronics and the connection from the tractor's machinery, ensuring the speed is correctly transmitted.\n\nI don't see any other steps or additional information needed beyond what's provided in the context.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections discussing the coupling shaft. The first part talks about mounting the coupling shaft, checking its length, and mentions that it's too long for most tractors. It also provides images but doesn't give specific instructions on what to do next. Then, in another section, it discusses lifting and lowering the power lift, mentioning adequate space for the coupling shaft sliding in/out and sufficient overlap between profiled tubes during extreme operating angles.\n\nThe question is specifically about checking the coupling shaft length before working between the tractor and machine. In the context, I see that under \"Checking the coupling shaft length,\" there are images but no detailed instructions on what to do next. However, the user provided an answer that says: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine.\" This seems like a precaution step because if the machine isn't supported, it might drop when the power lift is operating without the tractor nearby.\n\nI should make sure this is the exact information needed. The context mentions that after connecting the power lift, the coupling shaft must be shortened before connecting to the tractor. So, putting the machine on a supporting beam ensures it doesn't drop during operation while the tractor is between them. This precaution prevents any potential drops or damage.\n\nI don't see any other specific instructions in the context related to checking the length of the coupling shaft itself beyond what's already mentioned. The main focus here is on preventing accidental movement without the tractor, which is a good precaution.\n</think>\n\nPut the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine.",

The test involves setting the outflow opening direction (A for schmal, U for breit) and repeating the test annually on both sides to ensure equal distribution.\n\nThe question is asking what a tray test checks on a fertilizer spreader. From the context, I can see that the tray test assesses how well the spreader distributes fertilizer. It looks at whether the spreader's settings are correct by adjusting the outflow opening direction and checking if the distribution remains even after changes or part replacements.\n\nI also notice that the test is performed on both sides of the spreader to ensure equal distribution, which is important for maintaining consistent application.

It also specifies that wind speeds shouldn't exceed 3 m/s (wind force of 2) during actual spreading.\n\nSo putting this together: The tray test has a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s, and the actual spreading instructions mention the same limit for wind speed. Therefore, both the tray test and actual spreading are permissible under a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum wind speed permissible for both the tray test and actual spreading is 3 m/s.\n\nAnswer: 3",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see mentions of explosion dangers because of nitrate. That's important because it tells me that if the fertilizer has nitrate, it could cause an explosion if not handled properly. The context also talks about removing remnants from voids, corners, tubes, and tubing before welding. So that seems like a key precaution.\n\nLooking further down, there are sections about preventing unintended operation and releasing all pressure to prevent damage. These might be additional precautions but aren't directly related to the immediate issue of using nitrate-containing fertilizer during welding.\n\nThe user's question is specifically about what to do before welding when using such fertilizer. The main point here is removing remnants from specific parts of the machine. So, I should focus on that part.\n\nI also notice that there are images mentioned in the context, but since they're not relevant to the question, I can ignore them for now. The instructions mention avoiding contact with materials and wearing protective clothing, which might be related, but the main precaution is about removing remnants before welding.\n\nPutting it all together, the specific precaution is to remove nitrate-containing fertilizer remnants from voids, corners, tubes, and tubing before welding.

This might be relevant because it talks about ensuring everything is working correctly. The text mentions checking connections as described in a specific paragraph, which probably includes the agitator axle.\n\nIn that paragraph, there's an instruction to put the agitator back into the agitator axle. It also says something about letting go of the plastic bearing ring after the first fastening bolt is placed. This suggests that the system needs regular maintenance to prevent issues during operation.\n\nThe context doesn't explicitly state a replacement schedule for the agitator axle, but it does mention that the machine should be checked periodically. The instructions on page 133 might indicate that the axel seal should be replaced after certain periods, maybe every few hours or days, depending on the specific requirements of the machine.\n\nSince the exact details aren't provided, I'll have to infer based on common practices in such contexts. Often, mechanical systems like agitator axles are replaced after a set number of hours or days to ensure smooth operation and prevent wear and tear.

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see a list of steps under \"Wartungsintervalle\" which includes \"Kontrolle von Schrauben und Muttern,\" \"Kontrolle Hydrauliksystem,\" and \"Basisstelle Rührer und Rührerwelle.\" These seem to be controls or checks on the system, but they don't directly mention bushing height or discharge setting.\n\nNext, under \" maintenance\" there are steps like turning nuts up so the dosing mechanism moves upward. I notice that in one of these steps, it says \"dosising mechanism is now higher than the spreading disc and discharge bushing.\" That might indicate a problem with the bushing height being too low or something.\n\nLooking further down, under \" maintenance\" there's another step where they unscrew the discharge bush to lower it onto 1.0 mm thick plates. This suggests that adjusting the bushing is necessary when the mechanism is higher than expected.\n\nIn the \"Wartungsintervalle\" section, the first control is about checking the Vorderachslast and Hinterachslast. The third point mentions \"Basisstelle Rührer und Rührerwelle,\" which I think refers to the bushing or something related. But again, it's not directly about bushing height.\n\nI don't see any specific instructions regarding checking the bushing height or setting the discharge. All the steps are more about controlling and adjusting mechanisms rather than measuring or checking the bushing position.\n\nSo, based on this, I can't find any explicit information in the context that says how often the bushing height must be checked or the discharge set. The closest is the \"Wartungsintervalle\" section mentioning controls but not specific checks for bushing height.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide explicit instructions on how often the bushing height must be checked or the discharge set.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are guidelines for tightening torques in Nm for self-locking nuts, hexagon bolts, and nuts. The context lists various torque values under different conditions. \n\nLooking through the text, I notice entries like \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" which might be referring to specific torque values. There's also a section about quality friction, specifically *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10 and *.Thread Torques.80 (A4).0.10. These seem relevant because they mention the quality and friction values.\n\nThe question mentions M18 hexagon steel bolt with 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. I need to find a torque value that corresponds to these specifications. Scanning through, I see \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" which might be the general torque for M18 hexagon bolts. \n\nWait, but the specific values are *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10 and *.Thread Torques.80 (A4).0.10. These seem to be higher than 10.9 quality. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Perhaps M18 refers to a different size or the numbers after are for specific threads.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context is listing multiple torque options with different values and conditions. Since the question specifies M18 hexagon steel bolt, I should look for a torque value that matches this. \n\nLooking again, \"Torques.4.6.0,10.\" might be the primary entry, but it's not specific to M18 or 10.9 quality. The other entries like *.Thread Torques.70 and *.Thread Torques.80 are for different sizes or threads. \n\nI think I need to focus on the specific torque values given in the context that match the quality and bolt size. Since the question is about M18 hexagon, perhaps it's under a section labeled *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10 or *.Thread Torques.80 (A4).0.10. \n\nWait, but the numbers after the dot are for thread sizes: 70 and 80. M18 is a different size. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the context uses a different notation where M stands for material or quality.\n\nLooking back at the context, there's a section about *.Thread Torques with specific values. For example, *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10 and *.Thread Torques.80 (A4).0.10. These seem to be for different thread sizes but same friction. \n\nSince the question is about M18 hexagon steel bolt, maybe it's under a specific thread size like 6 or 8. If I'm not sure, perhaps the context doesn't provide enough detail. Alternatively, maybe the numbers after the dot are for different materials or qualities.\n\nI think I need to conclude that based on the provided context, there isn't an entry specifically mentioning M18 hexagon steel bolt with 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. The closest entries are *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10 and *.Thread Torques.80 (A4).0.10, which might be for different sizes or materials. \n\nTherefore, without a direct match in the context, I can't provide an exact torque value. Maybe the answer should state that the specific information isn't available.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not contain an entry specifically addressing M18 hexagon steel bolt with 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are guidelines for self-locking nuts, hexagon bolts, and nuts. The question mentions a specific type of bolt: M6, which is a standard size in metric units. The quality is given as A2, which refers to the material grade. \n\nLooking through the context, under \"Maintenance,\" I see sections about thread torques for different materials. There's a table that lists various bolts with their sizes and corresponding torque values. For M6 hexagon bolts, the torque values are provided in two columns: one for A2 quality and another for Gutes Streubild (which is German for good strength). \n\nThe question specifies a 70 (A2) quality bolt. I need to find the torque value under M6 for A2. Scanning through the table, I see rows like \"Torques.80 (A4).\" Wait, that's not matching. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table, there are entries for 70 and 80 in the first column. For M5, it's 3.6 Nm, then 5.7, etc., up to 9.4. Then under A2, I see \"Gutes Streubild, der Streuer ist gut eingestellt.\" That might be a note or an example, not the actual torque value.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is structured with different materials and sizes. Let me look for M6 in the first column. Under M5, it's 3.6 Nm, then 5.7, etc., up to 9.4. Then under A2, I see \"Gutes Streubild,\" which might be a note about the strength. But I don't see any specific torque value for M6 and A2.\n\nWait, maybe there's another section or perhaps an exception mentioned earlier. The context includes a line: \"Gutes Streubild, der Streuer ist gut eingestellt.\" That seems like it could be related to the A2 quality. But I'm not sure if that's a torque value.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the other columns for M6, under 70 and 80, there are entries but no specific torque values listed. The question is about a 70 (A2) bolt, so perhaps it's missing from the table provided.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Under \"Torques,\" there are multiple lines for different materials and sizes. For M6, under A2, I don't see any torque listed. The closest is 70 (A2) which might be a note rather than a value.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer expects that the torque isn't specified in this table because it's not provided. Alternatively, maybe there's an exception or additional information elsewhere. Since the question asks for the torque required, and based on the given context, I don't see any entry for M6 A2 70 (A2). So perhaps the answer is that the torque isn't specified in this table.\n\nWait, but looking back at the context, under \"Quality.Friction,\" there's a line: \"0  B                             Der Streuer streut zu schmal.  Setzen Sie die Einstellung der Auslassöffnung 2 Buchstaben  Richtung A  Wiederholen Sie den Test.\" That might be related to the friction coefficient, but it doesn't provide torque values.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since there's no specific torque value for M6 A2 70 (A2) in the provided context, I think the answer is that the torque isn't specified here.\n</think>\n\nThe torque required for a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction isn't provided in the given context.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see sections numbered 5 to 11. Section 5 talks about incorrect application rates in kg per hectare and mentions that if there's an issue with the spreader settings or flow rate, they should look for a spreading chart. That seems relevant because the question is about blocked flow.\n\nSection 6 discusses incorrect application rates again but focuses on the flow being blocked. It provides specific numbers like 118 kg per hectare and explains that after each use, the machine needs to be cleaned. This part also mentions closing the sieve and locking it properly, which might relate to preventing blockages.\n\nLooking further down, section 7 is about incorrect application rates but specifically mentions not entering the dosing setting or flow rate on the 'Curve Calibration' screen before starting activities. However, this doesn't directly address blocked flow; instead, it's more about ensuring proper setup for correct results rather than issues with flow itself.\n\nSection 10 talks about incorrect application rates again and mentions using a hopper cover under moist conditions to prevent buildup of damp fertiliser. This is another point related to preventing blockages but not the specific issue described in the question.\n\nSo, putting it all together, when the flow is blocked, I should look at sections 5 and 6 for guidance on how to adjust settings or clean the spreader after use. Section 7 isn't directly relevant because it's about correct application rates rather than blockages.\n</think>\n\nWhen the flow of the fertiliser is blocked, you should check section 5 for incorrect application rates and section 6 for details on cleaning the spreader after each use.

This indicates that the fine spreader is an additional piece of equipment beyond the normal one.\n\nThe context also mentions that fine application requires a small dosing opening to finely adjust settings and counter blockage. It advises using fine application when the flow rate is less than 40 kg/min, which might affect cost.\n\nSince the fine spreader is specifically designed for precise low application rates, it's likely more expensive than the normal spreader.

It mentions that the machine can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate, allowing the working width on the field edge to be set accordingly. The operation details include how it's used in fields and some technical specifications.\n\nThe question is whether this method works well for small gardens. From what I see, the page does mention that one-sided boundary spreading can adjust the spread width by changing the plate, which might help with smaller gardens where the field edge isn't too wide.

They should remove these and then work with caution, possibly repeating a test if needed.\n\nI don't see any other instructions related to no physician being available here. The context doesn't mention anything about doctors or emergency procedures. So, the answer should focus on the safety measures outlined in paragraph 12.\n</think>\n\nThe person should follow safety precautions as described in paragraph 12 of the context, which includes removing fertilizer remnants and working with caution.\n\nAnswer: According to paragraph 12, a person should remove fertilizer remnants before working on the machine and follow safety precautions.",

It also talks about preventing dirt, fertiliser, and water from entering the bearings after lubrication. Then there's a tip about using high-pressure cleaners without aiming them at seals or breathers to avoid dirt and moisture.\n\nNext, in the \"IndICATION\" section, under \"Arbeiten Sie in einer geschlossenen Kabine,\" it says that through open windows, doors, etc., can cause doorburs. In an open kabine, the gas pedal is higher. They suggest working in a closed kabine with an active kohlefilter in the fuel tank. Kunstdüngerstaub and a durable high-pressure load can cause body damage.\n\nThen, under \"Arbeiten Sie in einer geschlossenen Kabine,\" it mentions cleaning the machine, letting it dry, painting damaged paintwork, and lubricating again to conserve. It also says to use white parts like piston rods of hydraulic cylinders with preservative grease or inject metal parts with preserving liquid without hardening or drying.\n\nSo, the key points are that after cleaning, the machine is dried, then painted.

It also provides some interval checks for safety, like 10 times checking the immediate vicinity every 10 days and 100 days per month.\n\nThen there's a \"Betriebsanleitung\" section with page numbers and dates. Page 0 is about posten (which I think might be a typo for \"posten\" meaning \"post\" or something else, but maybe it's just a placeholder), page 1 has the manufacturer's details like software version, machine number, etc.\n\nLooking at the \"Kontroll- und Wartungsintervalle\" section on Page 2, it lists several numbers that indicate how often certain checks and reparable actions need to be performed. These are probably safety checks every 10 days and maintenance tasks every month or so.\n\nThe user's question is about the curriculum for a training program. From what I can gather, the key points from the context related to operating the machine are:\n\n1. The machine must be operated by one person from the tractor.\n2.

Under number 12, there's a section about \"Schnecken Linsen\" and \"Delicia\". The text below that says \"Schnecken Linsen\" is mineralically inclined, but it doesn't specify if they were used for the spreading chart.\n\nI think the answer provided earlier was \"Mineralisch\", which refers to the mineral composition. But since the question is about the type of pellet used in a specific example (the spreading chart), and there's no mention of Schnecken Linsen or Delicia, maybe the answer should be that it wasn't specified.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the context, I see that \"Schnecken Linsen\" are listed as mineralically inclined. However, in the text below number 12, it says \"Schnecken Linsen\" is mineralically inclined but doesn't specify if they were used for the spreading chart example.\n\nSo perhaps the answer should be that it wasn't specified or unknown because there's no information about Schnecken Linsen being used for that particular example. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a section where Schnecken Linsen are discussed in relation to the spreading chart.\n\nWait, let me check again. The context includes sections up to number 68, but none of them mention \"Schnecken Linsen\" or \"Delicia\". So perhaps the answer is that it wasn't specified and should be unknown because there's no information about Schnecken Linsen being used for the spreading chart example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking specifically about 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen', so if none of the context mentions this type in relation to the spreading chart, then it's unknown.\n\nBut wait, looking at number 12, there's a section that says \"Schnecken Linsen\" is mineralically inclined. So maybe the answer should be \"Mineralisch\", but I'm not sure if that refers to the pellet or the material type. Since the question is about the type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen', and the context doesn't specify, perhaps it's unknown.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text below number 12 says \"Schnecken Linsen\" are mineralically inclined but not necessarily used for the spreading chart example. So without more information, I can't determine the specific type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' used in that context.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at other sections where \"Schnecken Linsen\" is mentioned. In number 12, it's mineralically inclined but not specified for any particular application like spreading charts. So maybe the answer is unknown because there's no information about Schnecken Linsen being used in that example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to infer from other materials. The context includes \"Prills\" and \"Kristalin\", which are mineralically inclined as well. But again, without specific info on Schnecken Linsen for the spreading chart, it's unknown.\n\nI think the best approach is to state that the type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' used in the spreading chart example wasn't specified in the context and should be considered unknown.\n</think>\n\nThe type of \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" used for the spreading chart example was not specified in the provided context, so it is unknown.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

The text also talks about exchanging vane positions over time to ensure even wear, but it doesn't mention any maintenance intervals or specific hours before replacement.\n\nLooking further down, there's an image of the short vane and some information about maintenance checks. It mentions \"Maintenance intervals\" and provides examples like weekly inspections every 10 hours a week, which is roughly 70 hours per year. However, this doesn't directly address how long the vanes themselves last before needing replacement.\n\nThe question specifically asks for operational hours before replacement, so I'm looking for any information about the lifespan of the vanes. The context doesn't provide specific operational hours; it only talks about tightening torque and maintenance practices. Therefore, there's no direct answer in the provided text that answers how long the vanes last before needing replacement.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific operational hours for the vanes to determine their lifespan. It mentions tightening torque but lacks details on replacement duration.\n\n[Insufficient information]",

On page 126, it says \"All lubricating nipples of the machine can be filled with a universal grease type.\" That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should make sure that I'm not missing any other details about the grease type. The instructions mention things like checking the condition of protection sleeves and check chains, replacing them if damaged, which suggests that the grease is used for lubricating these parts.\n\nAlso, on page 2, under \"Lubricate the nipples,\" it says \"Grease the 2 nipples of both discharge bushings.\" This reinforces that universal grease is used here. There's no mention of other greases like exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD GS3 or any specific types beyond what's stated.\n\nSo, putting this together, the key point is that all lubricating nipples can be filled with a universal grease type.

The first page mentions that certain data needs to be provided when contacting the customer after service. It also lists the Maschinenummer (machine number), Zusatzausrüstungen (additional checks on the machine right after work), and includes a link to another page.\n\nLooking further, there are two pages about the Kverneland Group Nieuw-Vennep B.V., which is the manufacturer of the machine. The first page provides information about their business operations, including that they are the owner and have certain rights regarding technical changes. The second page seems to be a continuation or an update on the same company's details.\n\nThe question asks for a suitable lubricant for 'connectors' to prevent corrosion. Scanning through the context, I don't see any direct mention of lubricants recommended for connectors. However, there is a general section about not setting up electrical components and avoiding water-related issues that can cause electrical failures. But that's more about cleaning and preventing water damage rather than specifically lubricants.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information on lubricants for connectors, I should consider if any of the pages mention this. The first page talks about data transfer after service but not about lubricants. The second page is about the company details again. There's no section that mentions lubricants or connectors in relation to preventing corrosion.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there isn't enough information to determine a suitable lubricant for connectors.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the context, there are several sections about configuring a software, including instructions on how to adjust the dosing mechanism. The user mentioned that they can change the distance between the agitator axle and the seal ring by moving the dosing plate. They also have options for removing or adjusting the bolts attached to the discharge bush.\n\nIn the maintenance section, there are specific steps provided:\n1. Unscrew the bolts attaching the discharge bush to the star a few times.\n2. Move the discharge bushing upwards or downwards until the distance to the spreading disc is 1.0 mm.\n3. You can also put 1.0 mm thick plates between the discharge bush and the spreading disc and lower the discharge bush onto them.\n4. Turn on the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.\n\nFrom these steps, it seems that adjusting the distance is done by moving the dosing plate so that each side has equal distance from the agitator axle. The process involves unscrewing some bolts, moving the bushing up or down, and possibly adding or removing plates between them to achieve the desired distance.\n\nNow, considering screwdriver types:\n- A flathead screwdriver is typically used for making precise measurements on surfaces, often in mechanical applications.\n- A Phillips screwdriver is commonly used for tightening screws by turning a screwdriver around the screw until it fits into the hole.\n\nIn this context, adjusting the dosing mechanism likely involves loosening and tightening screws or bolts. The steps mentioned involve unscrewing some bolts (which might be flathead type) and moving the discharge bushing, which could involve either flathead or Phillips type screwdrivers depending on how they're used.\n\nHowever, since the question is about choosing between a flathead or Phillips screwdriver for adjusting the dosing mechanism, I need to determine which one would be more appropriate. The process involves loosening some bolts (flathead) and moving the bushing, which might involve either type. But in this case, the specific action of moving the bushing upwards or downwards until a certain distance is achieved could be done with either type.\n\nBut looking at the steps again:\n- Step 2: Move the discharge bushing upwards or downwards.\n- Step 3: Turn on the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.\n\nThis suggests that moving the bushing might involve turning it, which is typically done with a Phillips screwdriver. The flathead would be used for loosening and tightening screws, not necessarily moving the bushing.\n\nTherefore, I think the optimal screwdriver type for adjusting the dosing mechanism in this context is a Phillips screwdriver.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal screwdriver type for adjusting the dosing mechanism is a **Phillips screwdriver**.",

It says, \"Turn on the lock nuts on 4 fastening bolts without moving the dosing mechanism again.\" Then it goes into more detailed instructions about adjusting the height using plates and ensuring the agitator seal ring is properly aligned.\n\nThere's also a paragraph mentioned in the context titled \"Checking and setting the dosing mechanism\" which mentions that certain materials are used for this check. The paragraph refers to \"Prills,\" \"Kristalin,\" \"Mix,\" etc., but it doesn't specify exactly what type of material they are. However, from the earlier entries, I can see that materials like Prills, Kristalin, and Mix are types of particles or materials commonly used in such setups.\n\nWait, looking back at the context, under the \"Prills\" section, there's a description: \"3 Prills einwandfrei rund, innen hohl, manchmal kleine Löcher an der Oberfläche                                                                                                very glatt.\" This translates to 3 Prills which are smooth and sealed. So maybe these materials are used as fillers or stabilizers in the discharge bushing height check.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"Prills\" is the specific material they're referring to for the 'feeler gauge'. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the type of material rather than the count. Since the context doesn't specify exactly what material is used, but mentions that certain materials are recommended, maybe the answer should be a general category.\n\nWait, in the \"Checking and setting the dosing mechanism\" paragraph, it says to use specific materials like Prills, Kristalin, Mix, etc., which are all types of particles or fillers. So perhaps the answer is that these materials are used as fillers for the discharge bushing height check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term 'feeler gauge' refers specifically to a material that allows precise measurement, so it's likely referring to something like sandpaper or a specific type of filler. But given the context, I think the answer should be that certain types of particles are used as fillers for the discharge bushing height check.\n\nWait, but in the earlier entries, \"Prills\" is described as a material with smooth surfaces and no small holes. So maybe it's a type of fillable material. Alternatively, perhaps 'feeler gauge' refers to something like sand or a specific kind of filler that allows measurement without affecting the structure too much.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the context doesn't specify exactly what material is used, but from the entries, I can see that materials like Prills are mentioned as being smooth and sealed. So maybe the answer is that certain types of fillable particles or materials are recommended for this check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's referring to a specific type of material commonly used in such setups, which might be something like sand or a particular kind of filler.

Then it goes on about mineral water, which I'm not sure is relevant here.\n\nMoving down to section 4, titled \"Kristalin,\" it describes Kristaline as long and cylindrical in shape with rounded forms. It also mentions that they're hollow and have small holes on the outer surface. This seems like a type of powder or material used in agitators.\n\nSection 5 talks about \"Mix,\" which is a mixture made from various shapes, different from the previous sections. Then it goes into more detail about metal seal rings, mentioning that they are a mix of Körnern (which I think refers to nuts) with different forms and have rounded surfaces. It also says these are hollow and have small holes on the outer surface.\n\nLooking at section 6, titled \"Pellets,\" it lists Pellets as a material. The text doesn't specify the material here; it just describes them as a type of material without giving more details.\n\nIn section 7, there's a part about Saat Schneckenkörner, which I think refers to sausen snakerners or something similar. It mentions that these can vary in size and serve different functions. The text doesn't provide information on their material either.\n\nSection 8 is titled \"Prills,\" which again describes the mineral water but doesn't specify the material used for seal rings.\n\nFinally, section 9 discusses \"Mix\" again, mentioning it's a mixture of various forms with rounded surfaces and holes.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that there are several cables mentioned related to ISO 11786 connections. The key terms here are \"extended ISO cable\" and \"RS232 cable.\" \n\nLooking at the text, under \"Extended ISO cable,\" it says: \"Direkt zum ISO11786 'In Cab' Schlepperanschluss in der Schlepperkabine\" which translates to directly to the ISO 11786 connection in the tractor cabin. It also mentions that an optional extension cable can be mounted on the 7-point plug \"Input IM Tellus.\" \n\nThen, it says: \"You can mount an optional extension cable to the ISO 11786 'In Cab' Schlepperanschluss on the 7-point plug 'Input IM Tellus' cable supplied as a standard item.\" This indicates that there are two types of cables: one for direct connection and another for optional extension.\n\nThe text also mentions \"RS232 cable\" but doesn't specify its length. However, since it's an option, I should check if the RS232 is used in any specific way related to the tractor connection. \n\nWait, looking again, under \"RS232 Kabel,\" it says: \"144.\" That might be a typo because 144 meters seems too long for a cable used in a tractor connection. Maybe it's supposed to say 144 volts or something else? But since the question is about length, I'll go with what's provided.\n\nSo, putting this together: The optimal extension cable length isn't explicitly stated, but there are two options mentioned. One is for direct connection and another optional one that might be standard. Since the text doesn't specify a particular length beyond \"144,\" which seems out of context, I should consider if there's any other information.\n\nWait, under \"Directly to the tractor radar or wheel sensor\" it says: \"You can connect the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch control box with the optional 'Sensor input IM Tellus'.\" So that suggests that the extension cable is optional and not necessarily tied to a specific length. \n\nBut looking back, under \"Extended ISO cable,\" it mentions an optional extension cable on the 7-point plug. It doesn't specify the length beyond what's implied by the context. Since the text doesn't provide a specific length for this option, I might have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps in the context, there are two types of cables: one is the standard \"Input IM Tellus\" which is 144 meters, and another optional extension cable that's also 144 meters. So maybe both options are 144 meters? But that seems odd because an optional extension might not be as long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Extended ISO cable\" refers to a different length. Let me check again: under \"Extended ISO cable,\" it says: \"You can mount an optional extension cable to the ISO 11786 'In Cab' Schlepperanschluss on the 7-point plug 'Input IM Tellus' cable supplied as a standard item.\" So that's one option, and then another option is \"RS232 Kabel\" which is 144. Maybe both are 144 meters.\n\nBut wait, in the context, under \"Directly to the tractor radar or wheel sensor,\" it says: \"You can connect the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch control box with the optional 'Sensor input IM Tellus'.\" So that's another option. It doesn't specify a length beyond what's implied.\n\nI'm getting confused because the text doesn't provide specific lengths for these options. Maybe I should consider that both the standard \"Input IM Tellus\" and the optional extension cable are 144 meters, but that seems unlikely since an optional one might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a specific length mentioned elsewhere in the context. Let me scan again: under \"Directly to the tractor radar or wheel sensor,\" it says: \"You can connect the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch control box with the optional 'Sensor input IM Tellus'.\" It doesn't mention a length.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something in the context.

The first part talks about IsoMatch Grip, which mentions that most machine functions can be operated centrally with one handle. It also says that the free test period is mentioned later in a paragraph titled \"GEOCONTROL screen also displays the section of activities in a bar below the screen.\" \n\nWait, I don't see any mention of the test period duration here. The next part discusses IsoMatch GEOCONTROL and mentions that after the free test period expires, your machine can work with task controller, external application rate, and control for headland management and GEOSPREAD functions. It also provides a website link.\n\nThen there's another section about \"Arbeiten Sie in einer geschlossenen Kabine\" which talks about avoiding Kunstdüngerstaub by using a closed cabin. It mentions that the Geräuschpegel is higher, so working in a closed cabin can reduce body damage. It also says that tunnels and other openings can lead to health risks if not closed.\n\nAnother part discusses \"Kontrollieren Sie den Zustand des Schleppers und der Maschine\" which refers to checking the state of the root and machine. It mentions that the screen displays activities in a bar below the screen, and you need to check the driving distance for a spreading pattern test (tray test). The paragraph says that the free test period is mentioned later on page 76.\n\nWait, so I'm trying to find where it says the duration of the free test period. In the context provided, there's no mention of days or any specific number in the question section. It just talks about the test period being free and allowing machine use after that. So maybe the answer is that the free test period doesn't have a specified duration because it's not mentioned.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the context, I see another part where it says \"After the expiry of the free test period, allows your machine to work with task controller, external application rate, control for headland management and GEOSPREAD functions.\" So that's when you can use these features. But does this include a specific duration? It doesn't say how long the free test period is.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that there isn't enough information provided in the context to determine the exact duration of the free test period for the GEOCONTROL software user licence.\n</think>\n\nThe free 'test period' duration for 'GEOCONTROL software' user licence is not specified in the provided context.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section on Page 148 which talks about accessories like Hopper empty sensors and ExactLine tools. It mentions that the hopper empty sensor is equipped with an alarm that goes off when almost empty. Then it links to page 106 for more details on border spreading.\n\nOn Page 2, there's a section titled \"Kennzeichnung der Maschine\" which translates to \"Characterization of the Machine.\" This part describes the machine's specifications, including its model number and manufacturer. The machine is named Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD GS3, and it belongs to the company Kverneland Group Nieuw-Vennep B.V.\n\nThe question asks about a 'valve set' that comes with a hopper empty sensor. From the context, I see that on Page 148, there's an entry for ExactLine which is described as an accurate border spreading tool. It mentions that ExactLine provides a good pattern with optimal balance between profit and environment.\n\nHowever, the question specifically relates to a valve set that comes with a hopper empty sensor. The context doesn't directly mention a valve set; it does talk about sensors like the Hopper empty sensor. But looking through the pages, I don't see any information about a valve set in relation to the hopper empty sensor.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. On Page 148, there's an image for ExactLine and another image for the hydraulic border spreading plate. The text mentions that the hopper empty sensor is equipped with an alarm. But it doesn't specify a valve set in this context.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer isn't provided because the question refers to something not directly mentioned in the given context. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a section where ExactLine's valve type and manufacturer are discussed.\n\nLooking back at Page 148, there's no mention of a valve set with a hopper empty sensor. The only mention is about sensors like the Hopper empty sensor. Therefore, based on the provided context, there isn't any information about a valve set that includes a hopper empty sensor.\n</think>\n\nThe question refers to a 'valve set' that comes with a hopper empty sensor, but the provided context does not contain any information about such a valve set.

The text says, \"Ein zusätzlicher Lizenzschlüssel ist erforderlich, um das Softwaremodul freizuschalten.\" That part is about the software configuration, not directly about the drain rate.\n\nThen there's another section on getting familiar with the machine where it lists technical specifications. It mentions a 'Drain kit' and provides data like filling level, width, hopper width, weight, etc., but nothing about the drain rate in liters per minute.\n\nThe question is specifically asking for the drain rate in liters per minute of the 'drain kit'.

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the text, there are several sections discussing different types of hoppers and their covers. The section about \"Prills\" mentions that they have various shapes like Prills Schneckenkörner, which can vary in size and function. It also talks about hopper extensions and covers.\n\nIn the part under \"Hopper cover,\" it says: \"The hopper cover protects the fertiliser in the hopper against humidity and dirt. The sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening. The electric hopper cover can be operated from the control box. The hopper cover must be mounted on top of the hopper extension to protect the content against weather or spray.\"\n\nSo, the key points are that the hopper cover is used for spreading with pellets and it's made of granular material like Granulat. It also mentions protecting against humidity and dirt, which suggests it's a durable material.\n\nI don't see any mention of UV resistance in this context. The focus is on functionality and protection rather than color or material properties related to light. Therefore, the answer should be that the hopper cover uses granular material like Granulat for its construction.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper cover uses granular material such as Granulat for its construction.\n\n[Carefully extracted information: The hopper cover is made of granular material, specifically Granulat, to protect against humidity and dirt.
