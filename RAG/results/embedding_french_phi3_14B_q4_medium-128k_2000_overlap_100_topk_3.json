D'une part, vous voulez une dose complémentaire maximale après la bordure pour un bon rendement, d'autre part, vous voulez minimiser les pertes de l'autre côté de la bordure de parcelle.\nL'épandeur a 2 façons différentes de travailler et autant d'adaptations correspondantes pour l'épandage de bordure.\n· Épandage unilatéral en bordure à l'aide du déflecteur de bordure hydraulique,\n· Épandage des bordures avec ExactLine.\nPour l'épandage unilatéral en bordure, vous passez avec le tracteur le long de la bordure de parcelle et vous épandez dans la parcelle à partir de cette bordure. Pour l'épandage de bordure, vous passez dans la première voie de pulvérisation à partir de la bordure de parcelle et vous épandez en direction de la bordure de parcelle.\nNous vous recommandons d'épandre en premier lieu sur la parcelle avant d'épandre sur les bordures. Au cours de l'épandage de bordure, le système de commande n'effectue aucun étalonnage automatique et ne peut ainsi pas déterminer avec précision le bon réglage des ouvertures correspondant au débit souhaité. Par conséquent, le débit peut différer par rapport au débit souhaité au cours de l'épandage de bordure. En procédant d'abord à l'épandage sur la parcelle, le système de commande peut déterminer le bon réglage des ouvertures et épandre avec le débit adéquat, même au cours de l'épandage de bordure.\n Reportez-vous également au paragraphe »Épandage de bordure« de la page 106.",
