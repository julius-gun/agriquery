However, based on general knowledge about the machine's specifications and usage patterns, a reasonable estimate can be made.\n\nTypically, the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD has a maximum operating capacity of 4895 kg per working width (as mentioned in Page 35). Assuming an average working width of 30 meters, this would translate to approximately 1470 kg of fertilizer per hour. \n\nGiven that the machine operates at a speed of 410-570 rpm and uses a spreading disc with a diameter of 284 cm, it can spread around 2.8 liters (or approximately 1 liter) of fertilizer per second.\n\nConverting this to kilograms per hour:\n\n* 2.8 liters/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 10,080 liters/hour\n* 10,080 liters/hour / 1000 liters/kg = 10.08 kg/hour\n\nConsidering the machine's operating capacity of approximately 1470 kg/hour and assuming an average consumption rate of around 5-7% (a rough estimate), the tractor would consume:\n\n* 1470 kg/hour * 0.05 = 73 kg/hour\n* 1470 kg/hour * 0.07 = 101.4 kg/hour\n\nTherefore, a reasonable estimate for the extra diesel consumed by the tractor when using the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD is around 73-101.4 kg per hour.\n\nHowever, please note that this is an approximate calculation and actual consumption may vary depending on several factors such as the specific usage patterns, working conditions, and machine maintenance.",

Safety procedures: The manual emphasizes the importance of safety precautions when operating the tractor-mounted machines, including wearing protective clothing, ensuring proper ventilation, and avoiding contact with hazardous materials.\n2. Technical specifications: The manual provides detailed information about the machine's technical specifications, such as its weight, axle load, and hydraulic system capacity.\n3. Maintenance and repair: The manual covers maintenance and repair procedures for the machine, including inspections, cleaning, and replacement of parts.\n\nTo be considered competent to operate this machine, agrarians would likely need to complete a training program that includes:\n\n1. Safety training: A comprehensive safety training program covering topics such as hazard identification, risk assessment, and emergency response.\n2. Technical training: A technical training program focusing on the machine's operation, maintenance, and repair, including its mechanical systems, electrical components, and hydraulic systems.\n3. Practical experience: Hands-on training and practical experience with the machine to develop skills in operating it safely and effectively.\n\nIt is essential to note that the specific curriculum for this training program may vary depending on the country, region, or organization providing the training.",
