I need to confirm there's no other mention of different numbers. Checking other sections, like the part about the ExactLine on page 29, it mentions adjusting the boundary, but that's about the spread pattern, not the number of openings.

The user is asking specifically about the full field spreading pattern, which matches the \"Flächendüngung\" mentioned on Page 28. The answer should be 100% overlap.

The user is asking, \"What system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread?\" and they want a precise answer based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to scan through the context to find any mention of systems that measure fertilizer quantity. The context is in German, so I'll have to be careful with the translations. Let me look for keywords like \"measure,\" \"quantity,\" \"fertilizer,\" or \"system.\"\n\nLooking through the pages, on Page 31, there's a section about \"Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min)\" which translates to \"Discharge speed (kg/min).\" The context mentions that the computer calculates the required discharge speed using a formula involving working width, speed, and application rate. \n\nFurther down, there's a part about the \"automatische Abdrehtests\" (automatic rotation tests) that the spreader performs every 75 kg or each minute. The computer uses these tests to determine the correct dosing position corresponding to the discharge speed. \n\nThen, on Page 32, there's a mention of the \"ISO-Bediensystem\" (ISO control system) which uses the ISOBUS protocol. The spreader measures the amount of fertilizer being spread using weighing cells, and the computer compares this with the set dose, adjusting the dosing unit as needed. \n\nAlso, on Page 36, under technical data, there's a mention of the \"Zapfwellendrehzahl\" (spindle speed) and \"Schmierung\" (lubrication), but that's more about the machine's specifications. \n\nPutting this together, the key part is the \"ISO-Bediensystem\" which includes the weighing cells that continuously measure the fertilizer quantity. The system uses these measurements to adjust the dosing in real-time. \n\nWait, but the question is about the system that continuously measures. The context says the spreader measures the amount using weighing cells, and the computer adjusts based on that. So the system would be the ISO-Bediensystem, which incorporates the weighing cells. \n\nAnother mention is on Page 31: \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" This translates to \"The spreader measures continuously the amount of fertilizer being spread using weighing cells.\" \n\nSo the answer should be the ISO-Bediensystem, which includes the weighing cells. But the exact term in the context is \"ISO-Bediensystem\" which is the ISO control system. However, the specific component is the weighing cells. But the question asks for the system, not the component. \n\nWait, the context says the ISO-Bediensystem uses ISOBUS and the spreader measures with weighing cells. The system that continuously measures is the ISO-Bediensystem, which integrates the weighing cells. Therefore, the answer is the ISO-Bediensystem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is the \"automatische Abdrehtests\" but that's part of the process, not the system. The main system is the ISO-Bediensystem. Let me check again. \n\nYes, the key sentence is: \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" So the system is the spreader's weighing cells, but the system mentioned in the context is the ISO-Bediensystem. Wait, the ISO-Bediensystem is the control system, and the spreader uses weighing cells as part of that system. \n\nThe answer should be the ISO-Bediensystem, which continuously measures using the weighing cells. But the exact term in the context is \"ISO-Bediensystem\" which is the ISO control system. However, the question is about the system that measures, so the answer is the ISO-Bediensystem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is the \"Wägezellen\" (weighing cells), but the question asks for the system. The context says the ISO-Bediensystem uses these cells. Therefore, the system is the ISO-Bediensystem. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check the exact wording. The context says: \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" So the spreader (Streuer) measures via the weighing cells. The system that does this is the ISO-Bediensystem, which is the control system. \n\nWait, the ISO-Bediensystem is the control system, and the spreader is part of the machine. The system that continuously measures is the ISO-Bediensystem, which includes the weighing cells. Therefore, the answer is the ISO-Bediensystem. \n\nBut the user might be looking for the specific component, but the question says \"system.\" So the answer is the ISO-Bediensystem.

There's a section discussing the IsoMatch terminal and how it connects to the tractor. \n\nLooking through the context, specifically pages 32-34 and 39-42, there's information about connecting the IsoMatch to the tractor. On page 32, there's mention of non-ISO tractors using an IsoMatch power supply cable set. Then, on page 39, it says that if the tractor isn't ISOBUS-equipped, a Schlepper-ECU is needed, which has a 9-polig CAN connector.

The context mentions that the IsoMatch can receive speed signals from the tractor. If the tractor lacks ISOBUS, the solution involves using a Schlepper-ECU with a 9-polig CAN connector. The answer should specify using the Schlepper-ECU and connecting the CAN cable.

The text there says, \"Die Arbeitsbreite der Maschine wird in erster Linie durch die Drehzahl der Streuscheibe bestimmt.\" Translating that, it means the working width of the machine is primarily determined by the rotational speed of the spreading disc. \n\nAdditionally, the same page mentions that the rotational speed of the spreading disc depends on the universal joint shaft's rotational speed and the selected coupling point. So the coupling point of the universal joint shaft is also a factor. \n\nAnother mention is on page 46: \"Die (Online-)Streutabelle schreibt den Anschlusspunkt der Gelenkwelle vor\" which translates to the spreading table specifies the coupling point of the universal joint shaft. This reinforces that the coupling point is part of determining the working width. \n\nPutting this together, the working width is determined by the rotational speed of the spreading disc, which in turn depends on the universal joint shaft's rotational speed and the selected coupling point. The coupling point is specified by the spreading table. \n\nSo the answer should mention that the working width is primarily determined by the spreading disc's rotational speed, which is influenced by the universal joint shaft's speed and the coupling point. The coupling point is set according to the spreading table.\n</think>\n\nThe machine's working width is primarily determined by the rotational speed of the spreading disc, which depends on the universal joint shaft's rotational speed and the selected coupling point of the universal joint shaft.

The context is in German, so I need to be careful with the terms. \n\nLooking at the sections under \"Vor dem ersten Gebrauch\" (Before the first use), there's a part about parking the machine. It says: \"Parken Sie die Maschine auf den Abstellrädern nur, wenn der Behälter leer ist! Das Parken mit einem gefüllten Behälter hat eine verringerte Stabilität zur Folge. Zudem sind die Räder nicht auf eine große Belastung ausgelegt.

The instructions mention: \"Schalten Sie den Schlepper aus, ziehen Sie den Schlüssel aus dem Zündschloss und betätigen Sie die Feststellbremse des Schleppers.\" This means to turn off the tractor, remove the key, and engage the parking brake. This is during the process of connecting the machine. \n\nSo, the answer is yes, the parking brake should be engaged before connecting the machine. The exact instruction is to engage the parking brake (Feststellbremse) as part of the procedure when connecting the machine.

Scanning through other pages, like page 54, there's a similar statement: \"Der größte Arbeitswinkel der Gelenkwelle beträgt nach oben 30 ° und 30 ° nach unten.\" So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 30 degrees both when lifted and lowered. The user wants the exact information, so I should present it as 30° upwards and 30° downwards, or maybe just state the maximum as 30° in both directions.

There are sections about using the Online Streutabellenservice, the AutosetApp, and various settings like dosing rate, spreader adjustments, etc.\n\nThe question is about enabling fine application for low dosing rates. From what I remember, there's a section discussing the Feindosieren (which I think translates to \"fine dosing\" or \"low rate dosing\"). Let me check the relevant parts.\n\nLooking at Page 67, there's a section titled \"Feindosieren\" (Fine Dosing).

The steps involve turning off the tractor, adjusting the lever to the desired position, and ensuring it's locked. Also, the dosing rate is calculated using the formula provided, and the spreader settings are adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo, the answer should mention using the Feindosierhebel to close two openings and adjust the third, along with the formula for calculating the required discharge speed.

The text describes the handle's positions: \"3 offene runde Öffnungen für normales Dosieren, 1 offene runde und 2 geschlossene Öffnungen für das Feindosieren.\" This translates to three open round openings for normal dosing and one open round and two closed openings for fine dosing.\n\nThe question is about the symbol indicating the Fine application kit is enabled. The symbol here would likely be the representation of the handle's position. The text mentions that when using the Feindosier-Set, the handle is set to a position with one open and two closed openings. The symbol might be the notation for that position, which is described as \"1 offene runde und 2 geschlossene Öffnungen.\" \n\nLooking back at the context, on Page 69, there's a table with symbols like \"C,\" \"D,\" \"E,\" etc., which might correspond to different settings.

However, the exact symbol might be represented as a label or a specific icon. \n\nIn the context, on Page 67, there's an image reference for the Feindosierhebel with positions.

The answer might be that the symbol is the label indicating the handle is in the Feindosier position, which is described as having one open and two closed openings. However, the exact symbol might be represented as a specific icon or label. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the symbol in the Streutabelle, like the \"Feindosier-Set\" symbol.

Scanning through other pages, I don't see another reference to the hopper content and 100 kg. The rest of the context talks about calibration procedures, but this specific condition is only mentioned here. \n\nSo the answer should be that the automatic calibration is turned off when the hopper content is below 100 kg. The user wants a precise answer, so I need to state that exactly as found in the context.\n</think>\n\nWhen the hopper content falls below 100 kg, the automatic calibration is disabled.",

First, I need to recall what the context says about border spreading.\n\nLooking through the context, there are several sections discussing different methods of border spreading. On page 106, under \"Grenzstreuen,\" it mentions two different working methods for border spreading: \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech\" and \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit ExactLine.\" These seem to be the two primary functions. \n\nI should verify if there are any other mentions of functions related to border spreading. For example, on page 107, it elaborates on the hydraulische Grenzstreublech method, and page 110 talks about ExactLine. These sections confirm that the two functions are the hydraulische Grenzstreublech (single-shaft) and ExactLine (two-shaft) methods. \n\nThe question asks for the two functions, so the answer should list these two. The exact terms from the context are \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech\" and \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit ExactLine.\" Translating these into English, they would be \"Single-shaft border spreading with the hydraulic border spreader\" and \"Two-shaft border spreading with ExactLine.\" However, the user might expect the answer in German since the context is in German. But the instructions say to answer in English. Wait, the instructions say to answer in English. So I need to translate the terms accurately.\n\nWait, the original context uses terms like \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen\" which translates to \"Single-shaft border spreading\" and \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen\" as \"Two-shaft border spreading.\" The exact functions are using the hydraulic border spreader (hydraulisches Grenzstreublech) and ExactLine. So the two functions are:\n\n1. Single-shaft border spreading with the hydraulic border spreader (Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech)\n2. Two-shaft border spreading with ExactLine (Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit ExactLine)\n\nI need to make sure these are the exact terms from the context. Yes, that's correct. The answer should list these two functions as per the context.\n</think>\n\nThe two functions for border spreading are:  \n1. **Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech** (Single-shaft border spreading with the hydraulic border spreader).  \n2. **Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit ExactLine** (Two-shaft border spreading with ExactLine).",

The exact sentence is: \"Der Abstand zwischen der Innenseite des Zugseils und der Öffnung des Auslaufrohrs muss 109 mm betragen.\" Translating that, it says the distance between the inside of the rope (Zugseil) and the opening of the discharge pipe (Auslaufrohr) must be 109 mm. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions of similar distances. On page 138, there's a mention of a 1.0 mm distance between the discharge pipe and the spreader, but that's a different measurement. The question specifically asks about the rope and discharge bushing opening, which aligns with the 109 mm figure from page 136. \n\nNo other distances are mentioned that fit the exact terms \"rope\" and \"discharge bushing opening.\" Therefore, the answer should be 109 mm.\n</think>\n\nThe required distance between the rope (Zugseil) and the discharge bushing opening (Auslaufrohr) is **109 mm**.",

The models mentioned are 1875, 2550, 3225, and 3900. \n\nLooking at the row for the 3900 model, the entry under \"Eigengewicht (kg)\" (Own weight in kg) is listed as 795 kg.

Wait, no, looking again: \n\nWait, on Page 36, the technical data for Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD has several rows. Let me check again:\n\nRow 5: Eigengewicht (kg) is 795 for the 3900 model. Then row 10: Ohne Abdeckplane (kg) is 367.5, and row 11: Mit Abdeckplane (kg) is 414.5. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the \"Eigengewicht\" (own weight) should be the weight without any attachments. But here, the \"Ohne Abdeckplane\" is 367.5 kg, which is less than the \"Eigengewicht\" of 795 kg. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a typo. Wait, perhaps the numbers are for different models.

How can the weight without the cover be less than the own weight? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the numbers are for different models. Wait, perhaps the 3900 model's \"Eigengewicht\" is 795 kg, and the \"Ohne Abdeckplane\" is 367.5 kg, which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the \"Eigengewicht\" refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the total weight including the cover. But the question is about the weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900, which is likely the total weight.

Let me parse the table structure. The table headers are:\n\nQuality.Reibung *.Gewinde Anzugsmomente.70 (A2).0.10. Anzugsmomente.70 (A2).0.20. Anzugsmomente.70 (A2).0.30. Anzugsmomente.80 (A4).0.10. Anzugsmomente.80 (A4).0.20. Anzugsmomente.80 (A4).0.30.\n\nSo for each row, the first number is the bolt size (M5, M6, etc.), then the quality and friction coefficients. For example, for M18, the values are 176, 282, 352, 235, 376, 469. But I need to map these to the correct friction coefficients. The friction coefficients mentioned are 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 for the first three columns (70 A2), and 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 for the next three (80 A4). \n\nWait, the user is asking about a 10.9 quality bolt. Wait, the table on page 129 is for Edelstahl (stainless steel), but the question is about a steel bolt with quality 10.9. Wait, the table on page 129 is for Edelstahl (stainless steel), but the question is about a steel bolt with quality 10.9. Wait, maybe the user is referring to the table on page 129, which is for Edelstahl, but the question is about a steel bolt with quality 10.9. Wait, perhaps there's a confusion here. Let me check the context again.\n\nWait, looking at page 129, the table is for \"Anzugsmomente Edelstahl\" (stainless steel). The next page, page 130, is for \"Anzugsmomente Stahl\" (steel). So the user's question is about a steel bolt (Stahl), not stainless steel (Edelstahl). Therefore, I should look at page 130.\n\nOn page 130, the table for \"Anzugsmomente Stahl\" (steel) has entries for different bolt sizes. For M18, the values are:\n\nM18: 176, 282, 352, 235, 376, 469. Wait, the exact text is:\n\n\"7                         M18                         176                         282                         352                         235                         376                         469\"\n\nBut the headers for the table on page 130 are:\n\nQuality.Reibung *.Gewinde Anzugsmomente.70 (A2).0.10.

The user is asking about the torque in Nm required to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction coefficient.\n\nFirst, I need to recall where in the context this information might be. The context has several pages discussing maintenance, torque values, and fastening procedures. Specifically, pages 129 and 130 talk about torque moments for different materials and friction coefficients.\n\nLooking at page 129, there's a table for \"Anzugsmomente Edelstahl\" (Torque for stainless steel). The entry for M6 with quality 70 (A2) and friction 0.2 is listed as 9.9 Nm. \n\nI should verify if there's any other mention of M6 bolts with these specifications. Page 130 also has a table, but it seems to be for different friction coefficients. The 0.2 friction value is covered in page 129. \n\nThe answer should be 9.9 Nm as per the table on page 129.

The user is asking what to do if the fertilizer flow is blocked and which page to check. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of blocked fertilizer flow. The context is a technical manual, so it's likely there's a troubleshooting section.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see pages 152-154 discuss troubleshooting issues. On page 152, there's a list of problems and solutions. Problem 6 mentions \"Durchstrom von Kunstdünger wird behin- dert\" which translates to \"Flow of fertilizer is hindered.\" The solution says to clean the machine thoroughly after each use and replace the agitator if it's worn out. \n\nAdditionally, on page 153, problem 15 mentions \"Durchstrom wird an einer Seite behindert\" (flow is hindered on one side), suggesting the same solution: thorough cleaning and replacing the agitator if necessary. \n\nSo the answer should direct the user to check page 152 and 153, and the solution is to clean the machine and replace the agitator if worn. But the question specifically asks for the page to look, so the main reference is page 152 where the issue is first mentioned. However, since page 153 also covers related issues, maybe both pages are relevant. But the exact answer should be based on the context's direct mention.

The context seems to focus on spreading patterns, calibration, and system controls, not on fuel usage. There's a section about the ISO-Bediensystem and sensors, but no diesel figures. \n\nSince the question is about extra diesel consumption, and the context doesn't mention any specific numbers related to fuel usage for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD, the answer would be that there's no information provided.

It also talks about adjusting the dosing settings and using sensors to control the application rate.\n\nNow, the question is about cost comparison between fine application and normal dosing. The context doesn't explicitly mention anything about costs. It discusses technical aspects like dosing mechanisms, sensors, and how the machine adjusts based on various factors. However, there's no direct information regarding the financial cost of using fine application versus normal dosing. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of expenses or cost-related terms. Scanning through the sections, terms like \"Kosten\" or \"Preis\" aren't present. The focus is on operational details, safety, maintenance, and technical specifications rather than economic factors. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide any data on costs or pricing differences between the two dosing methods, the correct response would be that the information isn't found.

It mentions that for small doses, a small dosing opening is required, and using a transition to a more open opening is recommended. Then, in the \"Feindosierstand\" (fine dosing position), two of the three dosing openings are closed, allowing the fertilizer to flow through a single, more open opening. This setup is described as providing a more accurate and reliable flow, even for very small doses.\n\nHowever, the question is about suitability for small gardens. The context doesn't explicitly mention small gardens. It talks about adjusting dosing for small amounts, which could relate to small areas, but the term \"small gardens\" isn't used.

From the context provided, the tray test is part of the procedures for checking the spread pattern of a spreader, ensuring even distribution of fertilizer or similar materials. \n\nLooking through the context, there are several mentions of the tray test. For example, on page 77, it says that the tray test should be done under dry weather, low humidity, and maximum wind speed of 3 m/s. Also, on page 79, there's a mention of not using the spreader during rain or high humidity because the fertilizer can stick to the trays, making the results inaccurate. \n\nThe question is about temperature, specifically 40°C. The context doesn't explicitly mention temperature restrictions for the tray test. However, the related conditions mentioned are about weather, humidity, and wind. Since 40°C is a high temperature, it's possible that such conditions could affect the test's accuracy. But the context doesn't state that the tray test can't be done at that temperature. \n\nThe user's question is whether it's possible. Since the context doesn't provide information about temperature limits, the answer would be that it's not mentioned. However, the instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. Therefore, the correct answer here is that the context doesn't specify, so the answer is \"Unknown\".\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

But that doesn't directly answer the actuation method.\n\nWait, there's a part on page 85 where it mentions adjusting the plate's position and using the correct disc speed. However, the question is about pneumatic actuation. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at page 85, there's a section about the hydraulic border spreading plate and its settings. It mentions \"hydraulische Grenzstreublech\" and the adjustments needed. But there's no explicit mention of pneumatic actuation. \n\nWait, maybe on page 95? No, page 95 is about the spreader height.

The hydraulic border spreading plate is controlled via hydraulic systems. The question is about pneumatic actuation. \n\nLooking through the entire context again, I don't see any mention of pneumatic actuation for the hydraulic border spreading plate. The context talks about hydraulic systems, like the hydraulic control device for ExactLine, but not pneumatic. \n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, there's no information indicating that the hydraulic border spreading plate can be actuated pneumatically.

The user is asking, \"How should one proceed to stop spreading the fertilizer?\" So I need to find the exact steps from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of stopping the spreading process. The context is in German, so I need to be careful with the terms. Let me look for keywords like \"stop,\" \"stop spreading,\" or related actions.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section on page 90 under \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen\" which mentions stopping the spreading. Specifically, the instruction says: \"Stoppen Sie mit dem Streuen erst, wenn Sie mit dem Auffangbehälter mindestens eine Arbeitsbreite (z. B. 18 oder 24 Meter) passiert haben.\" Translating that, it means you should stop spreading when you've passed at least one working width with the catch container.\n\nAnother part on page 100 mentions stopping the spreading when the machine reaches the end of the field. For example, on page 100, it says: \"Stoppen Sie das Streuen, indem Sie die Dosiereinheiten der Maschine schließen, wenn Sie noch eine halbe Arbeitsbreite vom Parzellenende entfernt sind.\" So, closing the dosing units when you're half a working width away from the field end.\n\nAlso, on page 108, there's a step: \"Schalten Sie den Schlepper aus, ziehen Sie den Schlüssel aus dem Zündschloss und betätigen Sie die Feststellbremse des Schleppers.\" Which translates to turning off the tractor, removing the key, and engaging the parking brake. But this seems more about stopping the machine rather than the spreading process itself.\n\nThe key steps are stopping when passing a certain width and closing the dosing units. The exact answer should include both actions: stopping when the catch container has passed the working width and closing the dosing units when near the field end. Also, ensuring the dosing units are closed to prevent further spreading.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nStoppen Sie mit dem Streuen erst, wenn Sie mit dem Auffangbehälter mindestens eine Arbeitsbreite (z.

It mentions that when using the ExactLine or hydraulic border spreader, the spreader has two different working modes. Then, on page 107, there's a part about \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech\" (single-shaft border spreading with hydraulic border spreader). It talks about the direction X (1) which is the environmental position, where you spread less towards the field edge, resulting in less loss over the field edge but worse filling. \n\nWait, the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. Hmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong section. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at page 95, there's a section about \"Streuhöhe\" (spreading height). It says the distance between the ground or crop and the bottom of the spreader's blades must be 75 cm. That's the height setting. But the question is about the maximum height during spreading without GEOCONTROL headland. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is related to the 75 cm mentioned. The context says that the spreader should be set to 75 cm above the ground or crop. So when spreading without GEOCONTROL, the maximum height would be 75 cm. But I need to confirm if that's the case. \n\nLooking at the section on page 95, it clearly states: \"Der Abstand zwischen dem Boden oder dem Erntegut und der Unterseite der Schaufeln muss 75 cm betragen.\" So the distance is 75 cm. Therefore, the maximum height the fertilizer flies would be 75 cm. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the maximum height when spreading without GEOCONTROL headland. The 75 cm is the set height for the spreader, which might be the maximum height. However, I need to check if there's any mention of maximum height in the context related to the headland. \n\nAnother part on page 106 mentions that when using the ExactLine, the spreader is set to half the working width (1/2 X Meter) from the field edge.

However, there's a part about \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech\" (Single-plate border spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate). \n\nWait, maybe \"seven-sided\" is a mistranslation of \"Einscheiben,\" which translates to \"single-plate\" or \"single-sided.\" The context describes using a hydraulic border spreading plate to spread fertilizer along the field's edge, adjusting the working width.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the corrosion rate on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD compares between machines used in coastal areas versus inland agricultural regions. \n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant information in the provided context. The context is a manual for a machine, likely agricultural, discussing safety, operation, maintenance, and some technical specifications. The question is about corrosion, so I should look for sections related to corrosion or materials used.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see a section under \"Wartung\" (Maintenance) on page 21. It mentions that \"Kunstdünger und andere Salze haben großen Einfluss auf die Korrosionsgeschwindigkeit.\" Translating that, it says \"Artificial fertilizer and other salts have a significant influence on the corrosion rate.\" \n\nWait, but the question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD specifically. However, the context doesn't mention the Exacta-TLX model. The GEOSPREAD is mentioned in several places, like on page 23 and 24, but the Exacta-TLX isn't referenced. The user might be referring to the GEOSPREAD system as the Exacta-TLX, but that's an assumption. \n\nAssuming that the GEOSPREAD is the same as the Exacta-TLX, the relevant part is the corrosion influence from fertilizers and salts. The context doesn't directly compare coastal vs. inland regions. However, it does mention that salts (like those from fertilizers) affect corrosion. Coastal areas have more salt in the air due to sea spray, while inland areas might have less. \n\nBut the context doesn't explicitly state that coastal areas have higher corrosion rates. It only states that salts (from fertilizers) influence corrosion. So, the answer would be that the corrosion rate is influenced by the presence of salts, which are more prevalent in coastal areas due to sea spray, leading to higher corrosion compared to inland areas where such salts are less common. However, the context doesn't directly compare the two regions, so the answer must be based on the given info. \n\nWait, the user's question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. The context doesn't mention this model. The GEOSPREAD is discussed, but not the Exacta-TLX. Therefore, the answer might be that the context doesn't provide specific information on the Exacta-TLX's corrosion rate in coastal vs. inland areas. However, the user might be conflating GEOSPREAD with Exacta-TLX. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the GEOSPREAD system is part of the Exacta-TLX. If that's the case, then the corrosion is influenced by salts from fertilizers. Coastal areas have more salt in the air, leading to higher corrosion. But the context doesn't explicitly state this comparison. \n\nSince the context doesn't directly compare coastal and inland regions, the answer should be that the corrosion rate is influenced by the presence of salts (from fertilizers), which are more prevalent in coastal areas, leading to higher corrosion compared to inland areas. However, the exact comparison isn't stated in the context. \n\nBut the user's question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. Since the context doesn't mention this model, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context. However, the user might have made a typo, and the GEOSPREAD is the intended model. \n\nIn the absence of explicit comparison, the answer should be based on the given info. The context says that salts (from fertilizers) affect corrosion. Coastal areas have more salt in the air (from sea spray), so the corrosion rate would be higher there compared to inland areas. Therefore, the answer is that the corrosion rate is higher in coastal areas due to increased salt exposure, as per the context's mention of salts influencing corrosion.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Specifically, in the section about avoiding contact with harmful substances during cleaning, it says: \"Tragen Sie daher Schutzkleidung, wie z. B. Sicherheitshandschuhe, Sicherheitsschuhe und Schutzbrille.\" This translates to wearing protective clothing such as safety gloves, safety shoes, and safety goggles.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about cleaning fertilizer remnants before welding. There's another part under \"Explosionsgefahr durch Nitrat\" (Explosion hazard due to nitrate) which mentions removing fertilizer residues before welding. But it doesn't specify the type of gloves here. \n\nThe main mention of gloves is in the general safety section for cleaning, which lists safety gloves as part of the protective clothing. Since the question combines cleaning fertilizer (which is mentioned in the general safety section) and welding (which is addressed in the nitrate section), the answer would be the safety gloves mentioned in the general cleaning section. \n\nBut wait, the exact mention of gloves is in the section about avoiding contact with harmful substances during cleaning. The context says \"Sicherheitshandschuhe\" which are safety gloves. So the answer should be safety gloves, specifically mentioned in that part.

First, I need to go through the provided context carefully.\n\nLooking through the pages, the context is mostly about setup instructions for a machine, including parts like the coupling shaft, hydraulic systems, and maintenance steps. The question is about grease for profiled tubes in the coupling shaft. \n\nI'll start by searching for keywords like \"grease,\" \"profiled tubes,\" \"coupling shaft,\" or similar terms. Let me scan through the pages again.\n\nOn page 42, there's mention of \"Schmieren Sie die Gewindeenden der Schaufeln mit Fett ein.\" This translates to \"Lubricate the thread ends of the blades with grease.\" But this is about blades, not the profiled tubes of the coupling shaft.\n\nMoving to page 43, there's a section about Schaufeln (blades) again, and lubrication with grease. Still not relevant.\n\nPage 44 mentions \"Schmieren Sie die Gewindeenden der Schaufeln mit Fett ein\" again. Same as before. \n\nLooking at page 48, there's a part about \"Sicherungsmutter\" (locking nut) and \"Schmieren Sie die Gewindeenden der Schaufeln mit Fett ein.\" Still blades, not the coupling shaft's profiled tubes.\n\nPage 50 talks about the coupling shaft (Gelenkwelle) and mentions \"Schmieren Sie die Gewindeenden der Schaufeln mit Fett ein.\" Wait, but this is still about blades. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The question is about the coupling shaft's profiled tubes. The term \"profiled tubes\" might be \"Profilrohre\" in German. Let me look for that.\n\nOn page 51, there's a mention of \"Profilrohre\" (profiled tubes). The text says: \"Die Profilrohre sollen einander so weit wie möglich überlappen; es ist eine Überlappung von mindestens 150 mm erforderlich.\" But this is about overlapping, not grease.\n\nLooking at page 52, there's a section about \"Sicherungsketten der Schutzrohre\" (safety chains for protective tubes), but again, not grease.\n\nWait, maybe the grease is mentioned in the context of the coupling shaft's maintenance. Let me check page 50 again. The section about the coupling shaft (Gelenkwelle) mentions that the coupling shaft must be cut to the correct length, but there's no mention of grease here.\n\nLooking at page 51, under \"Gelenkwelle kürzen\" (cutting the coupling shaft), there's a part that says: \"Die Profilrohre sollen einander so weit wie möglich überlappen; es ist eine Überlappung von mindestens 150 mm erforderlich.\" Still no grease info.\n\nWait, maybe the grease is mentioned in the context of the hydraulic system? Let me check page 54, which talks about hydraulic hoses. There's a mention of \"Schmieren Sie die Gewindeenden der Schaufeln mit Fett ein\" again, but that's about blades.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding any direct mention of grease for the profiled tubes of the coupling shaft. The context seems to focus on lubricating the blades' thread ends with grease, but not the coupling shaft's profiled tubes. \n\nSince the question is about a specific grease type for the coupling shaft's profiled tubes, and the context doesn't mention any specific grease type for that part, the answer might be that it's not specified. However, the user's instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. \n\nWait, maybe I missed a part. Let me check again. On page 51, under \"Gelenkwelle kürzen,\" there's a mention of \"Die Profilrohre einfetten.\" Oh! \"Einfetten\" means to grease. So, the context says: \"Die Profilrohre einfetten.\" So, the profiled tubes (Profilrohre) should be greased. But what type of grease? The context doesn't specify the type, just that they should be greased. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the context doesn't specify the exact type of grease, only that greasing is required.

There's no specific number provided for the baud rate. \n\nThe user might be expecting a standard baud rate, like 9600, but the context doesn't state that. Since the instructions say to base the answer strictly on the context and respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure, I should check again if I missed any part.\n\nLooking through other pages, especially technical specs or settings, but I don't see any mention of baud rates. The context focuses on setup procedures, calibration, dosing, and safety, but not on communication parameters like baud rate. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the minimum baud rate isn't specified in the context. The user might need to refer to the IsoMatch control panel's manual for the exact baud rate settings, but based on the given text, there's no information provided.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

First, I need to find the relevant information in the provided context.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the context for any mention of fertilizer chunk size or blockage prevention. The context is mostly about operating a spreader, calibration procedures, and safety instructions. There's a section about avoiding blockages, especially when using low dosing rates. \n\nLooking at the part about Feindosierung (which I think is a specific dosing setting), there's a mention of avoiding clogging. The text says, \"Verstopfungen können dabei leicht auftreten, was zu einem schlechten Streubild und zu Schäden am Erntegut führen kann.\" But that's about clogging leading to issues, not the chunk size.\n\nFurther down, in the section about filling the machine, there's a note about avoiding contact with fertilizers and other substances. Then, in the \"Füllen\" section, there's a part that says: \"Lassen Sie Kunstdünger nie lange im Streuer. Durch Feuchtigkeit in der Luft können ebenfalls Brocken entstehen.\" This translates to not letting fertilizer stay in the spreader for too long, as moisture can cause chunks to form. However, it doesn't specify the maximum chunk size.\n\nAnother part mentions that when using very low doses (less than 25 kg/ha), the system can't perform automatic calibration because the weight is too small. But again, no chunk size info.\n\nWait, there's a section about blockage prevention when using the Feindosierung setting. It says, \"Um Verstopfungen zu vermeiden, können Sie 2 der 3 Dosieröffnungen schließen.\" But this is about closing two openings to prevent blockage, not the chunk size.\n\nLooking through the entire context again, I don't see any specific mention of the maximum chunk size in millimeters. The closest is the note about moisture causing chunks, but there's no numerical value provided. Since the question asks for a specific measurement in mm, and the context doesn't provide that, the answer would be that it's not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The question seems to be about the material of the tap (which could be a valve or a component) used in the hydraulic border spreading plate.\n\nI'll scan through the context for any mention of materials related to hydraulic components. On page 85, there's a section about the hydraulic border spreading plate. It mentions that for the H2O position, longer plates are provided, and the settings are A to D as per the spread table. However, there's no direct mention of the material of the tap.\n\nAnother part on page 91 talks about the ExactLine and mentions that during the spread test, the disc height is set to 75 cm. But again, no material info on the tap.\n\nWait, maybe the term \"tap\" refers to the hydraulic valve or a component that controls the flow. The context mentions \"hydraulic control device\" on page 89, but the material isn't specified there either. \n\nLooking for keywords like \"material\" or \"made of\" in the context. There's a mention of \"Aktivkohlefilter\" (activated carbon filter) on page 94, but that's for the cabin, not the tap. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is that the material isn't specified in the context.

The context is a manual for operating a spreader machine, discussing various settings, calibration, and techniques for spreading fertilizer. The question is about adjusting speed during border spreading to maintain the correct application rate.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section on \"Einsatz auf dem Feld\" (Field operation) which mentions adjusting speed. Specifically, on page 100, there's a part that says: \"Die Drehzahl des Schleppermotors (und somit der Zapfwelle) muss während des Streuens gleich bleiben (im Zusammenhang mit der Verteilung des Kunstdüngers in der Breite). Sie können die Fahrgeschwindigkeit somit nur anpassen, indem Sie einen anderen Gang wählen!\" \n\nThis translates to: The engine speed (and thus the drive shaft speed) must remain constant during spreading (in relation to the distribution of fertilizer in the width). You can only adjust the speed by selecting a different gear. \n\nWait, that doesn't directly mention a percentage reduction. Let me check other sections. On page 109, under \"Fahrmuster\" (Driving patterns), there's a mention of reducing the drive shaft speed to 75% for Situation A. \n\nIn the section \"Arbeiten aus Streuspuren heraus (Situation A)\" it says: \"Verringern Sie die Zapfwellendrehzahl auf 75 %.\" So, reducing the drive shaft speed to 75% when working from spray tracks (Situation A). \n\nBut the question is about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate.

However, the specific percentage might be mentioned elsewhere. \n\nLooking at page 110, under \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit der ExactLine\" (Two-shaft border spreading with ExactLine), it says: \"Wählen Sie, falls erwünscht, eine solche Beschleunigung, dass Sie mit derselben Fahrgeschwindigkeit wie beim Vollfeldstreuen fahren.\" Which means, if desired, choose an acceleration so that you drive at the same speed as during full field spreading. \n\nBut that's about maintaining speed, not reducing. However, in the section about working from spray tracks (Situation A), the drive shaft speed is reduced to 75%.

Point 4 mentions checking the condition of the blades (Schaufeln), but again, no specific hours. \n\nWait, on page 133, under \"Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus\" (Check and Adjustment of Dosing Mechanism), it says to check the dosing mechanism after the first 10 operating hours, every season, after every 100 operating hours, and if the spread pattern deviates by more than 3%. However, this is about the dosing mechanism, not the vanes.\n\nWait, maybe the vanes are part of the spreader's blades. If the question is about the blades (Schaufeln), perhaps there's a mention of their replacement interval. However, in the context provided, there's no explicit information about how many operational hours the vanes (blades) can last before replacement. The context does mention checking the blades' condition, but not their lifespan in terms of hours.\n\nSince the user is asking for the number of operational hours before replacement, and the context doesn't specify a particular number, the answer might be that it's not mentioned. However, I need to check again. \n\nWait, on page 125, under \"Wartungsintervalle\" (Maintenance Intervals), point 4 is \"Zustand Schaufeln\" (Condition of Blades), which is checked after the first 10 hours, every season, and after every 100 hours. But this is about inspection, not replacement. The context doesn't state that the blades need replacement after a certain number of hours. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no specific information about the operational hours before replacement for the vanes (blades). The answer would be that it's not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Let me check if there's a direct mention of connectors. On page 121, there's a note about using a lubricant that doesn't dry out and harden to prevent damage to cylinder seals. The term \"connectors\" might refer to parts like hydraulic couplings or other mechanical connectors. \n\nLooking further, on page 124, the table lists \"Getriebefett EP00/000\" for the central gear and other oils. However, the exact mention of connectors is in the note on page 121. The answer should be the lubricant that prevents corrosion, which is specified as a non-drying, non-hardening grease. \n\nWait, the exact text on page 121 says: \"Verwenden Sie ein Fett, das nicht austrocknet und hart wird. Und zwar, um Schäden an der Abdichtung der Zylinder zu vermeiden.\" Translating that, it's advising to use a grease that doesn't dry out or harden to prevent damage to cylinder seals. However, the question is about connectors, not cylinder seals. But maybe the connectors are part of the hydraulic system, so the same lubricant applies. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the table on page 124, the lubricant for the central gear is Getriebefett EP00/000. But the question is about connectors. Wait, in the context, the term \"connectors\" might refer to hydraulic couplings or other parts. However, the direct mention of connectors isn't there. \n\nWait, the user's question is about connectors, but the context mentions \"Kupplungen\" (couplings) in the hydraulic system. For example, on page 124, the table lists \"Getriebefett EP00/000\" for the central gear and other oils.

Alternatively, the answer might be the grease specified in the table for the central gear. \n\nWait, the user's question is about connectors, but the context doesn't directly mention connectors. However, the note on page 121 says to use a lubricant that doesn't dry out or harden to prevent damage to cylinder seals. Since the question is about connectors, maybe the answer is the same lubricant. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the table on page 124, the lubricant for the central gear is Getriebefett EP00/000. But the question is about connectors. Since the context doesn't explicitly mention connectors, but the note on page 121 talks about a lubricant that prevents corrosion (since drying out and hardening can cause corrosion), the answer might be that lubricant. \n\nBut the exact answer in the context is: \"Verwenden Sie ein Fett, das nicht austrocknet und hart wird.\" So the answer is a grease that doesn't dry out or harden. However, the question is about connectors, but the context doesn't specify connectors. However, the note is about cylinder seals, which are part of the hydraulic system.

I need to check the provided context to find any mention of screwdriver types related to the dosing mechanism.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context. The context is in German, so I need to look for any references to screwdrivers or tools. Let me go through the sections related to maintenance and dosing mechanism adjustments.\n\nLooking at Page 133, there's a section about controlling and adjusting the dosing mechanism. It mentions safety precautions but not specific tools. Page 134 talks about adjusting the dosing mechanism and mentions using a screwdriver to loosen the nuts on the 4 mounting screws. Wait, here it says \"Lockern Sie die Muttern der 4 Befestigungsschrauben, mit denen der Dosiermechanismus am Behälter befestigt ist, mit einigen Umdrehungen.\" The term \"Befestigungsschrauben\" refers to mounting screws. The text doesn't specify the type of screwdriver, though. \n\nLooking further, on Page 135, there's a mention of adjusting the dosing plates and using a screwdriver again. Still, no specific type is mentioned. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mention of tools in another section. Let me check the \"Anzugsmomente\" pages (129-131) for screw types, but those are about torque values, not screwdriver types. \n\nAnother place to check is the section about replacing hydraulic hoses on Page 132, but that's about hydraulic systems. \n\nHmm, the context doesn't explicitly state whether flathead or Phillips is required. The user might be assuming that the answer is in the text, but if it's not mentioned, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, sometimes in technical manuals, the type might be implied by the screws used. For example, if the screws are cross-head (Phillips), but without explicit mention, I can't assume. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify the screwdriver type for adjusting the dosing mechanism, the answer should be that it's not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

But wait, the question is about the typical lifespan before replacement. The context mentions both seasonal replacement and every 100 hours. However, since the user is asking for operational hours, the key point here is the 100 hours. The seasonal part might depend on usage, but the explicit number given is 100 hours. \n\nI need to confirm there's no other mention of the seal ring's lifespan elsewhere.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the 'small crack of light' dimension in millimeters between 'dosing baffles' when closed. First, I need to understand what exactly they're referring to. The term 'small crack of light' might be a translation or a specific term used in the context of the machinery described in the provided text.\n\nLooking through the context, there are several sections about maintenance and adjustments related to the dosing mechanism. The user mentioned 'dosing baffles,' which I think refers to the parts that control the flow of the fertilizer or substance being spread. The 'small crack of light' might be a small gap or space that allows some light to pass through when the baffles are closed, which is a way to check if they are properly aligned or adjusted.\n\nI need to search the context for any mention of dimensions related to the dosing baffles when closed. Let me scan through the pages. \n\nOn page 135, there's a section about adjusting the dosing plates. It says: \"Wenn die Dosieröffnungen nicht richtig schließen, dann verlieren Sie unnötig Kunstdünger und die Dosis ist unbeabsichtigt höher als Sie bei einer bestimmten Dosierstellung erwarten. Schieben sich die Platten zu sehr übereinander, ist die Dosis unbeabsichtigt zu niedrig. Wenn die Dosierscheiben in der korrekten Position montiert sind, dann können Sie, wenn die Dosieröffnungen geschlossen sind, noch einen kleinen Spalt sehen.\" \n\nThis translates to: If the dosing openings don't close properly, you lose unnecessary fertilizer, and the dose is unintentionally higher than expected. If the plates are pushed too much together, the dose is unintentionally too low. If the dosing discs are correctly mounted, you can still see a small gap when the dosing openings are closed.\n\nSo the 'small crack of light' is referred to as a \"kleinen Spalt\" which is a small gap. The question is asking for the dimension in millimeters. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the exact measurement of this gap. It only mentions that when the dosing discs are correctly positioned, a small gap is visible. There's no specific number provided in the text. \n\nLooking through other sections, like page 136, there's a mention of the distance between the inner side of the draw rope and the opening of the discharge pipe needing to be 109 mm. But that's for a different part. \n\nAnother part on page 138 talks about the distance between the discharge pipe and the spreader plate needing to be 1.0 mm. However, that's about the height, not the gap between the baffles. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide a specific measurement for the 'small crack of light' between the dosing baffles, the answer would be that it's not found in the context. The user might be referring to a gap that's visually checked but not quantified in the provided text.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the free 'test period' duration for the GEOCONTROL software user licence. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of a test period or trial period related to the GEOCONTROL software. The context is in German, so I'll need to parse through the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the pages, I see sections about the IsoMatch Shop and the GEOCONTROL software. On page 145, there's a mention: \"Über den IsoMatch Shop können Sie eine Nutzungslizenz erwerben, die ihre Maschine nach Ablauf des Gratistestzeitraums arbeiten lässt...\" Translating that, it says you can purchase a license that allows the machine to work after the free test period ends. The key term here is \"Gratistestzeitraums,\" which translates to \"free test period.\" However, the context doesn't specify the duration of this period. \n\nI'll check other sections for any mention of days or duration. Scanning through the rest of the document, there's no explicit mention of how many days the test period lasts. The answer might be that the duration isn't specified in the provided context. Since the question asks for the exact duration in days, and the context doesn't provide that number, the correct response would be that it's not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the valve type and manufacturer for the 'valve set' that comes with the hopper empty sensor. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of a valve set related to the hopper empty sensor. The context is in German, so I'll need to scan through the text for relevant terms. \n\nLooking at the sections about the hopper empty sensor, there's a mention of the \"Behälter leer Sensor\" (Hopper Empty Sensor). The context says, \"Der Sensor Behälter leer sorgt für einen Alarm, wenn der Behälter fast leer ist. Der Sensor wird immer mit dem Ablass-Set geliefert.\" So the sensor comes with an \"Ablass-Set,\" which translates to an emptying set or discharge set. \n\nNow, the question is about the valve type and manufacturer. The context doesn't explicitly mention a valve type or manufacturer in relation to the Ablass-Set. The term \"Ablass-Set\" might refer to a set of components for emptying the hopper, possibly including valves, but there's no specific information about the valve's type or manufacturer. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide details on the valve's make or model, the answer should indicate that the information isn't found. The user might be referring to a part that's not detailed here. Therefore, the correct response is to state that the information isn't present in the context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of a drain kit or related terms.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about the \"Behälter leer Sensor\" (Hopper Empty Sensor) and a \"Ablass-Satz\" (Drain Set). The context mentions that the drain set is used for quick emptying of residual fertilizer. However, I need to check if there's any specific information about the drain rate in liters per minute.\n\nScrolling through the pages, on Page 149 under \"Zubehör\" (Accessories), it says: \"Für eine genaue Einstellung einer manuell eingestellten Dosis ist eine Abdrehprobe erforderlich. Der Auffangbehälter ist dabei ein unverzichtbares Hilfsmittel. Zum schnellen Ablassen von Restdüngemittel ist ein Ablass-Satz erhältlich.\" This translates to needing a drain set for quick emptying of residual fertilizer. However, there's no mention of the rate here.\n\nLooking further, on Page 150 under \"Zubehör\" (Accessories), there's a mention of \"Abdeckplane\" (Covering tarp) and \"Pelletsieb\" (Pellet sieve), but nothing about drain rate. \n\nContinuing through the context, there's a section about \"Beseitigung von Störungen\" (Troubleshooting) on Pages 152-154, but those discuss issues with spreading rather than drain rates. \n\nThe only mention of a drain kit is in the context of the \"Ablass-Satz\" (Drain Set) being available for quick emptying, but there's no specific numerical value provided for liters per minute. The user is asking for a precise answer, but the context doesn't include the drain rate. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide the drain rate in liters per minute for the drain kit, the correct response would be that the information is not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

On page 150, under \"Zubehör\" (Accessories), there's a mention of \"Abdeckplane\" (cover plane) and \"Abdeckplane elektrisch\" (electric cover plane). The text says, \"Die Abdeckplane schützt den Kunstdünger im Kübel gegen Feuchtigkeit und Schmutz.\" This translates to the cover protecting the fertilizer from moisture and dirt. However, it doesn't mention the material or UV resistance here.\n\nFurther down, on page 150, there's a line: \"Dieses Sieb können Sie zum Streuen mit Pellets verwenden.\" Wait, that's about a sieve for pellets, not the cover. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at page 150 again, the section about the cover plane mentions that it's for protecting against moisture and dirt. The material isn't specified here. The electric cover plane is mentioned, but again, no material details. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that the material isn't specified in the context. The user is asking about the sail material, but the context doesn't mention any specific material for the hopper cover. The term \"sail\" might be a mistranslation or a specific term here. Alternatively, maybe \"Abdeckplane\" is referred to as a sail-like cover. However, the context doesn't state the material or UV resistance. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide information about the material of the hopper cover or its UV resistance, the correct answer would be that this information is not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",
