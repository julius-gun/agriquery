On the one hand you want to achieve maximum cover to the field edge to ensure a good crop, while on the other hand you want to minimise the loss over the field edge.\nThe spreader has 2 different functions and accessories to cater for border spreading.\n· one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate,\n· boundary track spreading with ExactLine.\nWhen one-sided boundary spreading, drive with the tractor along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. With boundary track spreading, drive down the first sprayer tramline from the field edge and spray in the direction of the border.\nWe advise you to spread the site first before you spread the borders. During border spreading, the control system does not perform any automatic calibration, so it cannot accurately determine the correct dosing setting for the required application rate. Consequently, the application rate can deviate from the required application rate during border spreading. By spreading the field first, the control system can determine the correct dosing setting and thus spread at the correct application rate, also during border spreading.\n</context>",
