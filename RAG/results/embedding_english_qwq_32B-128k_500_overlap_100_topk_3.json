There's mention of 15% difference in tube content and 25% in middle buckets when using the border plate. But nothing here about overlap percentage specifically.\n\nMoving to Page 84: This page discusses setting the discharge point, PTO shaft rpm, and angle adjustments. The term \"overlap\" isn't mentioned here either. It mentions working width and spreading pattern tests but no percentages related to overlap.\n\nPage 88 is about testing the full field spreading pattern with the hydraulic border plate. The instructions mention that the middle buckets might have 25% less application rate compared to outer tubes when using the border plate. However, this is about the difference in application rate, not overlap percentage. The page also refers to page 81 for the full field test, but since page 81 isn't included in the context, I can't check there.\n\nPage 89 is empty based on the provided context. \n\nThe question is about the \"overlap percentage\" for the full field spreading. The closest mention is on page 88 where it says the middle could be 25% lower, but that's during border spreading adjustments. The term \"overlap\" isn't used there. Since the context doesn't explicitly state an overlap percentage for the full field pattern, the answer should be that it's not found in the provided information.

The user wants to know how to transmit the tractor's driving speed to the IsoMatch when the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the provided context. The key points are on pages 32 and 33. On page 32, under \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set,\" it says that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you can add it with the IsoMatch power cable set. Then the tractor becomes ISOBUS ready, allowing connection via the IsoMatch control box. \n\nAlso, earlier on page 32, there's a mention about speed: \"If speed is not measured on the (trailed) machine, but via the tractor, the speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics. A special cable set is required for this.\"\n\nSince the question specifies the tractor lacks ISOBUS, the answer would involve using the IsoMatch power cable set along with connecting a speed sensor or adapter cable. The context says that after adding the power cable set, the tractor is ISOBUS ready, so the speed can be transmitted via that setup. The specific mention of the adapter cable for speed is crucial here. The answer should reference connecting the speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch using the special cable set. \n\nI need to ensure the answer is precise and based exactly on the context. The exact phrases are \"speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch\" and \"special cable set is required.\" So combining these, the answer is that the speed is transmitted by connecting the speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch using the special cable set. The mention of the power cable set for non-ISO tractors also supports this setup.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch by connecting the speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch using a special cable set.

The key details here are \"upper left\" and \"red extension\". \n\nI should make sure there's no other mention of the main switch location elsewhere.

Press the button for at least 1 sec.\" That seems directly relevant. \n\nThe key sentence here is \"Press the button for at least 1 sec.\" The question is asking for the duration, which is clearly stated as 1 second.

Check this again after one hour of use · after delivery and · after maintenance or repairs have been carried out.\"\n\nThat seems directly relevant. The phrase \"after one hour of use\" is specified here. The question mentions \"after initial setup\" and \"after any maintenance or repairs,\" which aligns with \"after delivery\" and \"after maintenance or repairs.\" The answer should be \"after one hour of use.\"\n\nAdditionally, looking at the table earlier in the context (pages listed as 8,9,10), there's a mention of checking after the first operating hour. That reinforces the same point. The instruction says to \"Turn all nut and bolt connections up to the point as given in the chart below · after the first operating hour, · regularly (at least weekly).\"\n\nSo combining both the table reference and the explicit instruction on page 38, the exact answer is \"after one hour of use\" or \"first operating hour.\" The answer needs to be precise, so using the exact wording from the context is important.

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of \"vane lock nuts\" or similar terms.\n\nLooking at the context, there are two main sections: one about steel tightening torques and another about stainless steel tightening torques. Under the steel section, there's a list of torques for different bolt sizes and qualities, along with notes about friction coefficients and exceptions. The exceptions mention that torques for bolts with serrated lower edges (like Tensilock and Whizlock) are 10% extra. \n\nWait, the question is about \"vane lock nuts,\" but in the context, the terms used are \"self-locking nuts\" and specific types like Tensilock (K100) and Whizlock. Vane lock nuts might be another term for self-locking nuts with serrated edges? The context says that for those types, the torques are 10% higher than the standard values listed. \n\nHowever, the question specifically mentions \"vane lock nuts,\" which I don't see explicitly in the text. The closest is the mention of Tensilock and Whizlock under the exceptions. If vane lock nuts are a type of self-locking nut with serrated edges, then the answer would be that their torques are 10% extra from the standard values. But the question is asking for the exact torque value. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the user is asking for a specific torque value, but without knowing the bolt size and quality, we can't pick a number from the tables. The context provides tables with different sizes (M5, M6, etc.) and qualities (like 4.6, 8.8, etc.), so the torque depends on those factors. The question doesn't specify the size or quality of the vane lock nut in question. \n\nHmm, but maybe the question assumes that \"vane lock nuts\" are the same as the self-locking nuts mentioned, and the 10% extra applies. However, without more details like the bolt size and the friction coefficient (0.10 or 0.13), we can't give a numerical answer. The user's question doesn't provide those specifics. \n\nLooking back at the question again: it just asks for the torque for vane lock nuts without any additional parameters. Since the context doesn't mention \"vane lock nuts\" explicitly, only \"self-locking nuts\" and specific types like Tensilock, which are 10% extra, but without the size or other details, the exact torque can't be determined from the given context. The answer might be that it's not found in the context because \"vane lock nuts\" aren't listed, or perhaps it's covered under the exceptions with the 10% increase. But since the question doesn't specify the size or other parameters, the answer can't be extracted precisely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"vane lock nuts\" are considered under the standard self-locking nuts, but the context says that serrated ones (like Tensilock) have 10% extra. If vane lock isn't one of those, then maybe they follow the standard torques. But without explicit mention, it's unclear. Since the question is about vane lock specifically and it's not in the text, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown. The context mentions \"self-locking nuts\" and specifies torque adjustments (10% extra) for types like Tensilock and Whizlock, but \"vane lock nuts\" are not explicitly referenced.

I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of the position sensor and its connection.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each page mentioned. Starting with Page 55, which talks about connecting hydraulic hoses and electric plugs. It mentions connecting hydraulic hoses for the ExactLine/Hydraulic border spreading plate. The steps here are about cleaning and connecting the hoses and electric plugs. The electric plugs include connecting the ISOBUS communication plug and the control box. There's a part about connecting an ISO plug to the control box and a CAN plug to the tractor's ISOBUS network. But there's no mention of a position sensor here.\n\nMoving to Page 86, it discusses using the H2O setting for border spreading and mentions the spreading chart positions A to D. However, this seems more about settings and not connections for sensors.\n\nPage 87 describes adjusting the border spreading plate based on test results but again, no mention of a position sensor's connection.\n\nPage 84 and 85 are about testing the spreading pattern, setting up troughs, and operational steps. There's talk about the spreading disc and dosing units, but nothing about a position sensor's connection point.\n\nLooking back through all the pages again to ensure I didn't miss anything. The term \"position sensor\" isn't appearing anywhere. The closest is the ISOBUS communication plug and control box connections on Page 55, but that's for communication, not a position sensor. The context mentions CAN plugs and ISO plugs, but again, no specific sensor connection details.\n\nSince the question is about the position sensor's connection location and the context doesn't reference a position sensor at all, the answer should be that it's not found in the provided information. The user instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. Therefore, the correct answer here is \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific precaution to take before working between the tractor and machine to check the coupling shaft length. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The question is about a safety step mentioned when someone has to be between the tractor and machine. \n\nLooking at the context, there are several mentions of safety precautions. On page 50, under \"Before first use\" and \"Mounting the coupling shaft\", there's a section that says: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.\"\n\nThat seems directly relevant. The key points here are putting the machine on a supporting beam, switching off the engine, and removing the keys. The question specifically asks for the precaution before working between them, so the exact steps mentioned here are important.\n\nAnother part on the same page reiterates: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine\" and mentions the same steps again. The answer should capture the main action here, which is using a supporting beam. Additionally, the steps about turning off the engine and removing the keys are also part of the precautions. \n\nThe question asks for the \"specific precaution\", so maybe the primary one is placing the machine on a supporting beam. The other steps (switching off engine, removing keys) are also part of the precautions but the main answer should include all the mentioned steps as per the context. Wait, the user wants the exact information from the context. Let me check again.\n\nThe exact instruction says: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\" So the precautions are two-fold: placing on a supporting beam AND switching off the engine with keys removed. \n\nThe question is about what should be done before working between them. The answer needs to include both actions. The user wants the exact wording from the context. The context says \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving... Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\"\n\nTherefore, the precise answer should list both steps. But maybe the primary one is the supporting beam. Wait, the question is about the precaution before working between the tractor and machine. The context explicitly states that putting the machine on a supporting beam is the first step. The other steps (switching off engine, removing keys) are also part of the precautions. \n\nThe answer should include all the mentioned precautions. The user's instructions say to be precise and exact. The exact phrases from the context are: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\"\n\nSo the answer should combine these two points. The user wants the specific precaution, so the exact answer is those two actions. Let me check if there's any other part. The context also mentions engaging the parking brake, but that's part of another step. Wait, looking again:\n\nIn the context under \"Checking the coupling shaft length\" steps: \"Engage the parking brake of the tractor.\" But the question is about the precautions before working between them. The initial part before the steps mentions the supporting beam and engine off. \n\nSo the correct answer is the combination of putting the machine on a supporting beam, switching off the engine, and removing the keys. The exact wording from the context is \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be exactly that, but since the user wants it concise, maybe just the key points. The question asks for the specific precaution, so the main one is the supporting beam. But the context also mentions the engine and keys. The user wants the exact information, so the answer should include all three actions? Wait, the steps also mention engaging the parking brake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the context again:\n\n\"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition. Without the support, a power lift that drops could wedge you in, resulting in possible serious physical injury.\"\n\nThen later steps under \"Checking the coupling shaft length\" steps:\n\n\"Engage the parking brake of the tractor.\"\n\nBut the question is about the precautions before working between the tractor and machine. The parking brake is part of the steps listed after placing the machine on the beam. Wait, in the initial paragraph under",

The user is asking: \"Below which application rate in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?\" I need to find the exact value from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for mentions of the fine application kit. There's a section that says, \"the fine application kit must be used.\" Looking at the preceding lines, there's a bullet point: \"· the relevant flowrate is 3.7 kg/min,\" and it mentions that the settings are based on using the fine kit. But that's an example, maybe not the threshold.\n\nAnother part mentions \"Calculate the required flowrate with fine application: 3 x 9 = 27 kg/min.\" But that's a calculation for a specific case. Wait, maybe there's a general rule. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the \"SlugPellets\" section, there's a table with kg/min values. The first column has 0.21, 0.32, etc., but those are probably for different settings. The key might be in the example with Nutramon. The example says the required flowrate was 9 kg/min, and then they multiplied by 3 for the fine application, getting 27. But that's specific to that scenario.\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"the settings given are based on using a fine application kit, which you do not need to calculate yourself.\" Hmm. Maybe the threshold is when the flowrate is below a certain value. Let me check the first example again. The example with the selected rate of 23 kg/ha had a flowrate of 3.7 kg/min and required the fine kit. Another example with 25 kg/ha needed 9 kg/min without the kit (but multiplied by 3 when using it). Wait, no—the 9 kg/min was the required without the kit? Wait, the Nutramon example says \"the required application rate falls beyond the scope,\" so they calculated 9 kg/min required, then for fine application, they multiplied by 3 to get 27, which fits into the dosing setting 18+3. That suggests that when using the fine kit, the flowrate is higher? Or maybe the fine kit is used for lower rates?\n\nWait, perhaps the fine application kit is needed for lower flow rates. In the first example, the flowrate was 3.7 kg/min and they had to use the fine kit. The second example required 9 kg/min without the kit, but when using the kit, they needed 27. That might mean that the kit is used when the required flow rate is below a certain threshold, and using the kit triples the flow rate? Or maybe the kit is used when the flow rate is below a certain value, and the setting is adjusted accordingly. \n\nLooking for explicit mentions: The context states \"the fine application kit must be used\" in the first example where the flowrate is 3.7 kg/min. There's no explicit number given like \"below X kg/min use the kit\". Wait, maybe in the \"SlugPellets\" table, the kg/min values are lower. Let me check the \"SlugPellets\" section. The table there has kg/min values like 0.21, 0.54 up to 2.5. But the question is about when to use the fine application. The instruction says \"the settings given are based on using a fine application kit\", so perhaps the kit is used for lower rates. The example with 3.7 kg/min required the kit, so maybe the threshold is below 4 kg/min? Or maybe the answer is 4 kg/min? Wait, in the first example, the flow rate was 3.7, which is below 4, and they used the kit. The second example's required flow was 9, which didn't need the kit (but when using the kit, they had to adjust). \n\nAlternatively, looking for any explicit statement. The context says: \"the fine application kit must be used.\" The only direct mention is in the first example's bullet points. But the question is asking for the threshold. Wait, in the Nutramon example, they had to calculate for 9 kg/min, and when using the fine kit, they multiplied by 3 (so 27). That suggests that the kit is used when the required flow rate is lower than the chart's minimum? Or perhaps the kit is used when the flow rate is below a certain value. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 4 kg/min. Looking at the first example's flow rate of 3.7 kg/min (below 4) required the kit. The next example's 9 kg/min didn't need it. So maybe the threshold is 4 kg/min. Let me check the context again. \n\nIn the \"SlugPellets\" table, the kg/min values go up to",

In the context, there's a section that says: \"The computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate with the following formula: Flowrate required = (kg/min) Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600\". \n\nThat seems to be the exact formula they're asking for. The formula is presented clearly here.

So the formula is Flowrate required equals (working width multiplied by driving speed multiplied by application rate) divided by 600. \n\nI should present it as written in the context, using the same variables and structure.

The text says, \"connect it with the supplied CAN cable to a standard tractor CAN connection.\" That mentions CAN, which is a type of serial communication. \n\nLooking further, page 143 mentions an \"IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable\" for ISOBUS tractors. The term \"9-point\" might refer to a 9-pin serial connector, but I need to confirm if that's the serial connection type. However, the context also refers to ISOBUS, which typically uses CAN bus. \n\nPage 32 mentions ISO 11786 In cab connection and refers to ISOBUS communication via CAN.

The question is about the danger after disengaging the PTO shaft. Let me check each page for relevant sections.\n\nStarting with Page 52, there's a section about connecting and disconnecting safely. It mentions the PTO shaft being off, but the question is after disengaging. Then on Page 18, under \"Safety,\" there's a part about the PTO shaft end. The exact sentence is: \"Protect the PTO shaft end well. Slide the protection sleeve over the PTO shaft as soon as the coupling shaft has been removed. Clothing could become entangled into an unprotected PTO shaft end that could lead to serious injury.\"\n\nAh, here it is. After disengaging (removing the coupling shaft), the unprotected PTO shaft end is dangerous because clothing can get entangled. The reason given is that without the protection sleeve, there's a risk of entanglement leading to injury. \n\nI need to make sure this is the only relevant part. Checking other pages: Page 54 talks about cutting the coupling shaft and connecting procedures, but not about the danger after disengaging. Page 53 and 55 don't seem relevant.

The advice there is to check the vanes. \n\nAlso, on page 83, the INDICATION section discusses adjusting the discharge point based on test results. For example, if the spreader isn't spreading wide enough, adjust the discharge opening towards A. But the question is about irregular spreading, not just width.\n\nLooking at entry 15 on page 84: \"The setting mechanism of the discharge point is not set well\" suggests performing the \"Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism\" as the action. \n\nEntry 16 mentions the dosing mechanism not being set well, which could also affect spreading. \n\nThe user's question is about irregular spreading. The context doesn't explicitly use \"irregular\" but entries 12-16 list possible causes. The closest direct advice for a problem leading to visible tracks (which might be a symptom of irregular spreading) includes checking vanes (entry 13), discharge point settings (entry 12,15), and dosing mechanism (16). \n\nThe question is about spreading irregularly, so the answer might involve checking those components. The exact instruction in the context for such issues points to checking vanes (entry 13 says \"Check the vanes\"), so that's a possible answer. Alternatively, the discharge point and PTO RPM (entry 12). \n\nWait, the exact question is \"spreads irregularly\"—the context's entry 13's issue is \"Worn or missing vanes\" leading to visible tracks, which could be part of irregular spreading. The answer given there is to check the vanes. \n\nAlternatively, entry 15 and 16 also suggest checking mechanisms. But the most direct answer from the context for a spreading issue (like irregular) related to vanes is entry 13's instruction to \"Check the vanes\". \n\nSo the answer should be: Check the vanes.\n</think>\n\nCheck the vanes.",

Wait no, looking at the structure:\n\nThe table starts with:\n\nType | Operation | pattern | Surface\n\nFor row 2 (mineral), the line is:\n\n2            mineral                                                                  angular, with sharp angles and edg- es                                                                     very rough\n\nAh, here, the \"pattern\" for mineral is \"angular, with sharp angles and edges\" and the surface is \"very rough\". So the pattern is \"angular, with sharp angles and edges\".\n\nThe question is specifically about the pattern, so the answer should be that phrase. Let me confirm there's no other mention of mineral's pattern elsewhere. The images mentioned include \"mineral\" but the text here in row 2 is the key. The answer should be the exact text from the pattern column under mineral.\n</think>\n\nangular, with sharp angles and edges",

The user is asking for the hopper weight without the hopper cover in kg for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 model.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has a table with different models: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. The question is about the 3225 model. \n\nLooking at the rows in the context, there's a section labeled \"Hopper weight\" followed by \"Without hopper cover (kg)\". The entries under the 3225 column for that row are 337,5 kg. Wait, the numbers are separated by commas, which might be decimal points in some countries, but here it's likely just a separator for thousands. But in this context, since the numbers are like 277,5, maybe it's 277.5 kg. However, the question specifies kg, so the comma is probably a decimal. But in some regions, commas are used as decimals. However, looking at the other entries, for example, the weight (kg) row has 705, 735, etc., which are whole numbers. The hopper weights without cover are 277,5; 307,5; 337,5; 367,5 for the four models. Since the models are 1875,2550,3225,3900, the third one (3225) would be 337,5 kg. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the 3225 model. The columns are aligned under each model. The 3225 column's \"Without hopper cover (kg)\" is 337,5. So the answer should be 337.5 kg. But the context uses a comma, so maybe it's written as 337,5. The question says to answer in English, but the number format might stay as per context. However, the user might expect a decimal point. But the instruction says to be precise and exact from context. The context shows 337,5 so the answer should be 337,5 kg. Wait, but the answer needs to be in English, so maybe convert the comma to a period? Hmm, but the exact data uses a comma. The user might want the exact value as presented. \n\nLooking at the context again, under the row \"Without hopper cover (kg)\", the entries are 277,5; 307,5; 337,5; 367,5 for the four models. The third column is 3225, so 337,5 kg. The answer should be 337.5 kg if converted, but the context uses a comma. Since the instruction says to answer in English, perhaps the comma is a decimal separator, so 337.5 kg. But the exact text uses a comma. The user might want the exact number as in the context. Let me check the question again. The question says to answer in English, but the context's numbers use commas. Maybe the answer should be written as 337,5 kg? But in English, it's usually a decimal point. However, the user might prefer the exact value from the context. Since the context has 337,5, I should present it as is. Wait, but the answer needs to be in English. Maybe the comma is just a thousands separator? Wait, 337,5 would be 3375 if comma is a thousands, but that doesn't make sense because the next model's value is 367,5. So it's more likely a decimal. So the answer is 337.5 kg. But the context uses a comma, so perhaps the correct answer is 337,5. The user might accept that. The instruction says to be precise and exact. So I should take it as written. The answer is 337,5 kg. But the question asks for kg, so maybe just the number. The question says \"hopper weight without hopper cover in kg\", so the answer is 337.5 (if converted) or 337,5 as per context. Since the context uses a comma, I'll go with 337,5. But in English, it's 337.5. Hmm. The user might expect the exact value from the context. Let me check the context again.

Scanning the tables, there's a section under \"Technical specifications\" with columns labeled 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. These numbers might correspond to different models. \n\nLooking at row 5 in the first table, the \"Weight (kg)\" row has values 705, 735, 765, 795 under each model respectively. Since the question is about the 3900 model, the corresponding weight would be 795 kg. \n\nI should double-check if there's any other mention of weight for the 3900 elsewhere. The \"Maximum load capacity (kg)\" is listed as 3900 in the first column, but that's probably the capacity, not the machine's own weight. The \"Weight (kg)\" row is more likely the machine's weight. \n\nAnother check: the \"Maximum total weight (kg)\" is 4895 for all models, which might include the load. The question specifically asks for the weight of the machine itself, so 795 kg seems correct. \n\nNo conflicting info found in other pages. The answer should be 795.\n</think>\n\n795",

I need to find the exact interval from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context sections related to maintenance intervals. The question is about the vanes, so I should check the pages mentioned, especially where \"Vanes\" or \"condition of the vanes\" is mentioned.\n\nLooking at Page 125 under the \"Maintenance intervals\" section. There's a list with different maintenance tasks and their intervals. Let me parse that list:\n\nLooking at line 3: \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle · \" and line 4: \"Condition of the vanes · \". The symbols next to them might indicate the intervals. The columns here are labeled as after first 10 hours, weekly, every 100 hours, min. 1x per year, and \"as recommended\" or \"if worn\". \n\nThe columns are a bit unclear because the headers are broken. The original text on Page 125's maintenance intervals has headers that are partially cut. The headers are: \"da il y af te r th e first 10 hou rs we ekly ev ery 1 00 ho urs min. 1 x per ye ar As r eco mme nde d If worn Page\". So reconstructing the headers:\n\nProbably the columns are:\n\n- After the first 10 hours\n- Weekly\n- Every 100 hours\n- Min. 1x per year\n- As recommended\n- If worn\n\nEach row has entries marked with a bullet (·) in the applicable column. \n\nFor line 4: \"Condition of the vanes · \" — the bullet is in the \"weekly\" column? Let me check alignment. \n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nLine 3: Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle · — the bullet is under \"every 100 hours\" maybe? Or perhaps the alignment is different. The exact placement of the bullets is crucial here. \n\nThe original text for line 3 and 4:\n\n3 Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle ·                                                                                                                \n4 Condition of the vanes · \n\nThe bullet for line 3 is under \"every 100 hours\" (since the columns are after 10h, weekly, every 100h, annually, as recommended, if worn). The bullet for line 4 (vanes) is in the same column as line 3? Or maybe the bullet is in the weekly column?\n\nWait, the way it's written in the context:\n\nLooking at line 3 and 4:\n\nLine 3: \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle · \" — the bullet is after the description. The columns are arranged such that each column is marked with a · in the respective column. \n\nThe headers are:\n\nColumns (from the headers line):\n\n\"da il y af te r th e first 10 hou rs we ekly ev ery 1 00 ho urs min. 1 x per ye ar As r eco mme nde d If worn Page\"\n\nSo splitting the headers properly:\n\n- After the first 10 hours\n- Weekly\n- Every 100 hours\n- Min. 1x per year\n- As recommended\n- If worn\n\nThe alignment of the bullets under each task's line indicates which interval applies. \n\nLooking at line 4 (Condition of the vanes):\n\nThe line says \"Condition of the vanes · \" — the bullet is in the \"weekly\" column? Let me see the structure. \n\nIn the context, line 4 is written as:\n\n4 Condition of the vanes · \n\nThe bullet is placed after the description. The spacing might indicate which column it's under. Since line 3's bullet is under \"every 100 hours\" (assuming the alignment), line 4's bullet might be under \"weekly\". Wait, perhaps the first bullet in line 3 is under \"every 100 hours\", and line 4's bullet is under \"weekly\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Condition of the vanes\" is under the weekly interval. Let me check another entry for reference. \n\nLooking at line 1: \"Checking bolts and nuts\" has bullets in the first two columns (after first 10h and weekly). The line says \"· · \" which would mean both intervals. \n\nLine 2: \"Checking the hydraulic system\" has a bullet in the first column (after first 10h). \n\nLine 5: \"Checking and setting the dosing mechanism\" has a bullet in the third column (every 100h) and fifth (as recommended). \n\nSo for line 4 (vanes), the bullet is in the second column (weekly).

On page 140, there's a section titled \"Replacing agitator axle seal\" which mentions that the seal must be replaced every season and after every 100 operational hours. \n\nLooking at page 125 under the \"Maintenance intervals\" section, there's an entry for \"agitator seal\" in row 21. The columns indicate the maintenance intervals. The \"every 100 hours\" column and the \"min. 1 x per year\" column have marks, which probably mean it's done every 100 hours and at least once a year. But the exact wording on page 140 says \"every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours.\" \n\nSince the question asks for the interval, the answer should combine both the seasonal and the operational hour requirements. The exact phrase from page 140 is the most direct answer. However, the table on page 125 might also support that. But the user wants the exact info from the context. The key line is on page 140: \"The seal must be replaced every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours.\"\n\nSo the answer should be \"every season and after every 100 operational hours.\"\n</think>\n\nevery season and after every 100 operational hours",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the torque required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context has two main sections: one for steel tightening torques and another for stainless steel. Since the question specifies a steel bolt, I'll focus on the first section.\n\nLooking at the steel section, the table lists different qualities like 4.6, 8.8, 10.9, 12.9, and friction coefficients 0.10 and 0.13. The columns are labeled under \"Torques.10.9.0,10\" and \"Torques.10.9.0,13\" for the 10.9 quality with friction 0.10 and 0.13 respectively. \n\nThe rows are for different bolt sizes. The M18 is listed in row 3 (since the rows start at 0: M5 is row 0, M6 row1, M8 row2, M10 row3? Wait, no, looking back, the rows are numbered 0 to 7 for steel. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the steel section, the rows are numbered from 0 to 7. The M18 is in row 7? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the steel table:\n\nRow 0: M5\n\nRow 1: M6\n\nRow 2: M8\n\nRow 3: M10\n\nRow 4: M12\n\nRow 5: M14\n\nRow 6: M16\n\nRow 7: M18\n\nYes, so M18 is row 7. \n\nNow, the columns for 10.9 quality with 0.13 friction. The column headers are a bit confusing. The headers are listed as:\n\nQuality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13. Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13. Torques.12.9.0,10. Torques.12.9.0,13.\n\nSo each \"Torques.XXX.0,XX\" corresponds to the quality and friction. For 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction, the column is \"Torques.10.9.0,13\". \n\nLooking at the headers, the order is:\n\nAfter \"Quality.Friction\", the next columns are:\n\nTorques.4.6.0,10 (quality 4.6, friction 0.10)\n\nTorques.4.6.0,13 (quality 4.6, friction 0.13)\n\nTorques.8.8.0,10 (8.8, 0.10)\n\nTorques.8.8.0,13 (8.8, 0.13)\n\nTorques.10.9.0,10 (10.9, 0.10)\n\nTorques.10.9.0,13 (10.9, 0.13)\n\nThen 12.9 etc.\n\nSo for M18 (row7), the 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction column is the sixth column after the first two (since the first two columns are \"Quality.Friction\" and then the size). Wait, the exact headers are a bit hard to parse because of the formatting. Let me count the columns properly.\n\nThe headers line is:\n\nQuality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13. Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13. Torques.12.9.0,10. Torques.12.9.0,13.\n\nSo splitting by periods? Or maybe the headers are separated by spaces. The way it's written, after \"Quality.Friction *.Thread\", the next entries are the torque columns. Let me see the actual data rows.\n\nLooking at the first data row (row0 for M5):\n\n0                         M5               1,7                 2                 5                 6                  7                  8                  9                 1",

                    "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and with a 0.2 friction be fastened?",
                    "expected_answer": "9.9 Nm",
                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the torque in Nm required for a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context has two main sections: one for stainless steel tightening torques and another for steel tightening torques. Since the question specifies a stainless steel bolt, I should focus on the first section labeled \"Stainless steel tightening torques\".\n\nLooking at the stainless steel section, there's a table with columns for different qualities and friction coefficients. The relevant rows are those under \"Torques.70 (A2).0.20\" because the question mentions 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction. \n\nNow, I need to find the row for M6. Scanning the rows, the second entry (row 1) is for M6. The columns for the 70 (A2) quality and 0.20 friction should be the fifth and sixth columns? Wait, let me check the headers again. The headers for the stainless steel part are a bit confusing. Let me parse the columns properly.\n\nThe headers listed are:\nQuality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30.\n\nSo for the 70 (A2) quality, the columns are:\n- 0.10 friction: third column (Torques.70 (A2).0.10)\n- 0.20 friction: fourth column (Torques.70 (A2).0.20)\n- 0.30 friction: fifth column (Torques.70 (A2).0.30)\n\nWait, actually, the way the headers are written might be a bit off. Let me re-express the headers properly. The first line after \"Stainless steel tightening torques\" has:\n\n   Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30.\n\nSo splitting that into columns, each \"Torques.XXX\" is a separate column. So for the 70 (A2) quality, the columns are:\n\n- Torques.70 (A2).0.10 (column 3)\n- Torques.70 (A2).0.20 (column 4)\n- Torques.70 (A2).0.30 (column 5)\n\nThen the next set is for 80 (A4).\n\nLooking at the rows, the M6 row is row 1 (since row 0 is M5). The entries for row 1 (M6) are:\n\n1                         M6                   6.3                   9.9                  12.2                   8.4                  13.2                  16.3\n\nBreaking this down, the columns after M6 are:\n\n- Torques.70 (A2).0.10: 6.3\n- Torques.70 (A2).0.20: 9.9\n- Torques.70 (A2).0.30: 12.2\n- Then the next columns are for 80 (A4) quality, starting with 0.10 friction: 8.4, etc.\n\nSo for M6, 70 (A2) quality, and 0.2 friction, the value is 9.9 Nm. \n\nI need to confirm that the question is indeed referring to the stainless steel section. The question mentions \"stainless steel bolt\", so yes, that's correct. The other section is for steel, which isn't relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the correct torque is 9.9 Nm.\n</think>\n\n9.9",

The user is asking what to do if the fertilizer flow is blocked and which page to refer to.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context includes pages 114, 115, 116, and 117. The question is about a blocked fertilizer flow, so I should focus on sections discussing causes and solutions for blockages.\n\nStarting with Page 114 under \"INDICATION\", it lists possible causes of failures, including blockages by hard objects, fertiliser chunks, or encrusted layers. The page also gives instructions like using a hopper cover, not leaving fertiliser in the spreader, and cleaning after use. It mentions steps to handle the machine carefully, disconnect PTO, switch off systems, etc. But the specific actions to resolve a blockage might be in the following pages.\n\nLooking at Page 116, under \"stoppage\" INDICATION, it says if the blockage is due to an encrusted layer, you can try reducing the lump with tools. It also mentions steps like inspecting hopper contents, fitting vanes, checking discharge settings, and continuing spreading. If the lump is out of reach, it refers back to the \"Damage\" section mentioned in the previous paragraph, which is on Page 115.\n\nPage 115's \"Damage\" section details examining discs, discharge openings, checking for damage caused by hard objects, and steps like placing an object in the discharge opening, engaging the control box, and emptying the hopper. It also mentions repairing damage and refers to page 93 for transport preparation. \n\nThe question asks where to look, so the answer should point to the page numbers where the solution is. The main instructions for handling blockages due to stoppage (encrusted layers) are on Page 116, but the \"Damage\" section related to blockages from hard objects is on Page 115. However, the initial steps for blockages (like using tools, checking lumps) are on 114 and 116. The user's question is about what to do if the flow is blocked. The exact steps for resolving the blockage (like using a stick, screwdriver, etc.) are on Page 116 under \"stoppage\". The page numbers mentioned in the context for the solution steps are 114, 115, and 116. But the question specifically asks \"at what page should I look?\" So the answer should list the relevant pages where the procedures are detailed. \n\nLooking at the context, the initial blockage causes and some steps are on Page 114. The detailed steps for handling stoppage (blockage) are on Page 116. The \"Damage\" section on Page 115 also has related steps. However, the exact answer might be that the primary instructions are on Page 114 and 116. But the question might be pointing to the pages where the solution is. The user might need to refer to the pages where the problem is addressed. The context mentions \"until emptying the hopper\" which is part of the \"Damage\" steps on Page 115. \n\nWait, in the context, on Page 116 under \"stoppage\", it says if you can't reduce the lump, you should follow the working method described in the previous paragraph \"Damage\" on Page 115. So the answer would involve both pages 114 (for initial steps) and 115/116. But the question is asking where to look. The exact answer in the context says to refer to the \"Damage\" section on Page 115. \n\nAlternatively, the main steps for blockage due to stoppage (encrusted layers) are on Page 116. The user should look at Page 114 for causes and initial steps, and Page 116 for the procedure. But the question is phrased as \"what should I do if the flow is blocked, at what page should I look?\" The answer should list the page numbers where the solution is found. \n\nLooking at the context again, the first part of the answer (the actions) are on Page 114 and 116. The \"Damage\" section on Page 115 is referenced from Page 116. The user should look at Page 114 and 116. However, the exact instruction on handling the blockage (using tools, etc.) is on Page 116. The page numbers mentioned in the context for the answer are 114 and 116. But the question might expect the page numbers where the solution is detailed. \n\nThe answer should be concise.

The main technical specifications on pages 37, 38, 98, 99, 100, and the initial tables.

Page 98 and 99 discuss tramline patterns and boundary spreading methods, which are operational techniques but not related to fuel usage. \n\nThe question specifically asks for extra diesel consumption, so I might be missing something. Maybe there's a part in the technical specs or another section that mentions power requirements or hydraulic systems that could imply fuel use. The \"Electrical supplies required\" on page 37 mention an ISObus control box and trailer sockets, but that's electrical, not diesel. \n\nThe tractor power (kW) is listed on page 37, row 6, but the value is blank.

The context on page 107 talks about using the hydraulic border spreading plate in the field, adjusting the working width, and mentions environmental and yield settings. Page 106 also discusses border spreading, differentiating between one-sided boundary spreading and boundary track spreading. It advises spreading the site first before the borders. \n\nHowever, the key point here is whether it's suitable for small gardens. The context repeatedly refers to \"field edges,\" \"property borders,\" and \"ditches,\" which are more associated with agricultural fields rather than small gardens. There's no specific mention of garden size or small areas in the provided information. The instructions mention adjusting the working width, but there's no indication that it's designed for small spaces. \n\nThe testing procedure on page 84 mentions positioning troughs 2 meters from a line marking a fictive ditch.

Let me start by scanning the pages given. \n\nOn page 144, under the \"Accessories\" section, there's a part that says: \"Other connections are the same as the 'Input IM Tellus' cable set, supplied as a standard item.\" Hmm, but that might not list the specific types. \n\nLooking at page 143, there's a bullet point under the \"Input IM Tellus with ISO11786 In cab connection\" section: \n- ISO 11786 In cab\n- lights and ignition\n- Tractor CAN (optional plug specific to the tractor required)\n- Video input.\n\nThat seems to list the connections the cable is used for.

The answer should include lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and Video input. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"other kind of connections\" so maybe excluding the ISO 11786. The context on page 143 says the standard item includes those four. Since the question is about what else besides the ISO connection, the answer would be the other three: lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and Video input. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. On page 32, it mentions connecting speed sensor or adapter cable to IsoMatch, but that refers to different cables. Page 144 also mentions \"Sensor input IM Tellus\" for tractor's speed sensor or radar, but that's an optional accessory, not the standard cable. \n\nSo the exact answer from the context is the list on page 143 under the bullet points. The answer should list those three: lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (with the note about optional plug), and Video input. But the user wants it concise.

The user is asking, \"How should one proceed to stop spreading the fertilizer?\" I need to find the exact steps from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context pages (114-117) for any mention of stopping the spreading process. On page 114, under \"Working method\" and \"INDICATION,\" there's a section about handling failures or stoppages. It mentions steps like disconnecting the PTO shaft, switching off the electronic control system, turning off the tractor, and engaging the handbrake. But that seems more about addressing blockages rather than stopping spreading intentionally.\n\nLooking at page 116, under \"Use in the field\" and \"stoppage,\" there's a section about handling blockages. The steps here include closing the sieve, inspecting for lumps, refitting vanes, checking settings, and closing the hopper cover. However, the question is about stopping the spreading process, not resolving a blockage. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user wants to know the procedure to stop spreading. The context might not explicitly state \"how to stop spreading\" but perhaps the steps to address a stoppage or shutdown. On page 114, the steps after a failure include disconnecting PTO, switching systems off, and ensuring the tractor is off. That seems like part of a shutdown procedure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe under \"To be done before spreading\" on page 115, but that's preparation steps. The closest is the section on page 114 under \"Finding the cause of the failure or stoppage\": it says to disconnect PTO immediately, switch off electronic control, turn off tractor, remove key, engage handbrake. These steps are to safely address a stoppage but might also apply to stopping spreading intentionally. \n\nSince the question is about proceeding to stop spreading, the exact steps from page 114 under the \"Handle with care\" section are the most relevant. The key points are disconnecting the PTO shaft, switching off systems, tractor, etc. The answer should list those steps precisely as given.\n</think>\n\nDisconnect the PTO shaft immediately, switch off the electronic control system, switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition, and engage the handbrake of the tractor.",

The key here is to look specifically for information related to the height when GEOCONTROL isn't being used.\n\nStarting with Page 97, the context talks about spreading on the headland, filling passes, tramlines, and using GEOCONTROL.

The user is asking why damage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing is most likely caused by a hard object. I need to look through the provided context to find the exact reason.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context on page 115. The section under \"Damage\" mentions examining the components and checking for damage. The key part here is the sentence: \"If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The agitator is probably damaged too. You must first repair the damage or have it repaired before continuing with spreading.\"\n\nSo the exact answer is right there. The context directly states that the damage is \"most likely caused by a hard object.\" There's no need to infer anything else. The answer should be a direct quote from that sentence. I just need to make sure there's no other part of the context that provides a different reason. Looking through page 116, the troubleshooting section talks about other issues like noise or vibrations, but nothing about hard objects causing damage. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is that the damage is caused by a hard object, as stated in the context. No other information is needed. I'll present that exactly as written.\n</think>\n\nThe damage is most likely caused by a hard object.",

The context doesn't explicitly mention what to do in the absence of a physician. \n\nLooking further, page 73 also mentions reading safety instructions from the supplier and wearing protective clothing. However, that's preventive, not a response to an accident. The other pages (like 114-115) discuss mechanical issues with the spreader, not first aid. \n\nSince the context strictly says to contact the physician and doesn't provide alternatives if that's not possible, the answer would be that the context doesn't specify actions when a physician isn't available.

I need to find the exact information from the provided context that answers this.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context pages mentioned. The question is about the consequences of not lubricating the grease nipples. \n\nLooking at Page 118 under \"Storing the machine\" and \"Cleaning\", there's a section that mentions lubricating before and after cleaning. The context says: \"It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, grease and oil all items once again for conservation.\"\n\nThe key part here is the reason given for lubricating: to prevent dirt, fertiliser, and water from entering the bearings. The implication is that without lubrication, these contaminants would enter the bearings. The question is about what happens if they are never lubricated, so the answer would be the opposite of the prevention mentioned here.\n\nThe exact wording from the context is: \"If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings.\" So, if not lubricated, dirt, fertiliser, and water would enter the bearings. \n\nI need to check if there's any other part of the context that directly states the consequences. Looking through other pages like 126 and 125, the maintenance intervals mention lubrication steps but don't explicitly state the negative outcomes. Page 118 is the only place that directly addresses the consequence of not lubricating. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that dirt, fertiliser, and water will enter the bearings if the nipples are not lubricated. The exact phrase from the context is the prevention statement, so reversing that gives the answer.\n</think>\n\ndirt, fertiliser and water will enter the bearings",

It says to grease them if there's difficulty during coupling/decoupling and mentions doing it at least once per season. However, the exact grease type isn't listed here either.\n\nThe key point is that the only mention of a grease type is the \"universal grease type\" on page 126, which applies to all lubricating nipples. Since the profiled tubes are part of the coupling shaft's components and the user is asking specifically about them, the answer likely refers to this universal grease. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that the profiled tubes use this exact type. Wait, but the instruction says \"All lubricating nipples...\" and the coupling shaft has grease nipples. So maybe the profiled tubes are lubricated via those nipples with the universal grease. \n\nAlternatively, when the user mentions \"profiled tubes,\" maybe there's another mention. Let me check again. On page 127, when talking about greasing the profiled tubes, the steps mention applying grease to the running surface, but no specific type is given there. The only grease type mentioned is the \"universal grease type\" for the nipples. Since the question is about the profiled tubes, but the context doesn't specify a different grease for them beyond the universal type mentioned for the nipples, the answer should be the universal grease. \n\nWait, but the central gearbox mentions gear wheel grease EP 00/000, but that's for a different part. The profiled tubes' grease isn't specified beyond the universal type.

On page 50, the focus is on mounting the coupling shaft, checking its length, and safety precautions. Page 51 continues with shortening the shaft, and page 54 talks about connecting to the tractor, coupling the shaft, and more safety steps. Page 55 is mentioned but there's no content provided.\n\nLooking for any mention of \"hose coupling support\" specifically. The terms \"coupling shaft\" appear frequently, but \"hose coupling support\" isn't something I can find. The context discusses protection sleeves, check chains, PTO shafts, and drive axles, but not a hose-related component. The question might have a term that's not present in the given text. \n\nSince the instructions emphasize answering with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if the info isn't present, and after a thorough check, I don't see \"hose coupling support\" mentioned. The answer should reflect that the information isn't available in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The question mentions \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen,\" which seems to be a product name. Scanning through the context, I see \"Delicia\" listed under \"Schnecken Linsen\" in the section with images. There's also a mention of \"Slug pellets\" and a table on page 58 that discusses different types of fertilizers or pellets based on their characteristics.\n\nLooking at page 58's table, the types are categorized from 0 to 7. The entry for \"Slug pellets\" is listed under type 7, labeled as \"Seed Slug pellets\". The description says that seeds can vary but are part of this category. Since the example in the context refers to spreading slug pellets, and \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" is mentioned near the images related to slug pellets, it's likely that the type corresponds to the Seed Slug pellets category. \n\nThe question asks for the specific type from the example. The example given in the context under the spreading chart mentions \"slug pellets\" and refers to using the fine application kit. The table on page 58's type 7 is the only mention of slug pellets as a type. Therefore, the answer should be \"Seed Slug pellets\".\n</think>\n\nSeed Slug pellets",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer in millimeters to prevent blockage. I need to find this information strictly from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context again. The main sections talk about distribution of granule sizes. There's a part that mentions different diameter ranges and their implications. \n\nLooking at the indications regarding distribution: \n\nThe first bullet says if 10% or more are under 2.0mm, spreading is difficult. The second bullet states that if 80-100% are between 2.0-4.75mm, it's good. The third bullet warns that if 20% or more are over 4.75mm, it's problematic, leading to distribution issues and crop damage. \n\nThe question is about preventing blockage. The context mentions blockage in the tip about cleaning the parts to prevent blockage, but that's more about maintenance. The main info on granule sizes and their effects is in the bullet points. \n\nThe key point here is the 4.75mm threshold. The third bullet says having 20% or more over 4.75mm causes issues. But the question is about the maximum acceptable size to prevent blockage. The context doesn't explicitly mention blockage due to size, except in the tip about cleaning. However, the distribution guidelines might imply that exceeding 4.75mm in a significant percentage (20% or more) is problematic. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. The context says if over 20% are above 4.75mm, it's difficult for optimum distribution and could damage crops. The term \"chunk\" here might refer to those larger granules. Since the problem arises when 20% or more are over 4.75mm, the maximum acceptable would be up to 4.75mm. But the exact threshold for individual chunks? The distribution sections mention the ranges. The 4.75mm is the upper limit for the optimal range. So the maximum acceptable size is 4.75mm. Because anything above that in significant quantity causes issues. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 4.75mm as the upper limit. The context doesn't mention blockage directly, but the question might be inferring from the distribution guidelines. Since the problem with blockage isn't explicitly stated except in the maintenance tip, but the main issue with size over 4.75mm is distribution and crop damage. However, the user's question is about preventing blockage. The only mention related to blockage is the tip to clean the parts to prevent them from getting blocked. But that's about maintenance, not the granule size. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is not directly stated. Wait, the question is about maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. The context says \"If the diameter of 20% or more of the fertiliser granules is greater than 4.75 mm it would be difficult for optimum distribution. This could lead to damage to the crops as the granules could make holes in the leaves of the crop.\" So the issue here is crop damage, not blockage. The blockage part is about cleaning the sieves. \n\nWait, the user might be conflating blockage with the distribution issues. The problem with large granules (over 4.75mm) is causing distribution issues and crop damage, but not necessarily blockage of the spreader. The actual blockage prevention is mentioned in the tip to clean the parts. \n\nSo maybe the context doesn't explicitly state the maximum size to prevent blockage. The question might be looking for the 4.75mm as the upper limit from the distribution criteria, even though the context's main issue with that size is distribution and crop damage, not blockage. Since the user's question is about blockage, but the context doesn't directly link size to blockage except in the maintenance tip. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distribution meter's largest sieve is 4.75mm, so anything above that is considered problematic. The distribution example given is 0-70-30-0, which has none above 4.75mm. The instruction says to use the distribution meter with the 4.75mm slot. So maybe the maximum acceptable is up to 4.75mm. \n\nSince the question is about preventing blockage, and the only related part is the tip to clean to prevent blockage, but the granule size's upper limit for optimal spreading is 4.75mm. The answer is likely 4.75mm. Even though the context's main issues with that size are distribution and crop damage, the question might be expecting that number as the maximum to stay within the optimal range. \n\nTherefore, the answer is ",

The user is asking about the tolerance for the measured distance from the bottom of the vanes to the ground or crop, in centimeters.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant section. The question mentions \"measured distance from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop\". Scanning through the pages, on page 95, under the section \"Adjusting the machine\" and \"Spreading height\", there's a paragraph that says:\n\n\"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\"\n\nThe key point here is that the distance must be exactly 75 cm. The question is about the tolerance, which would indicate the allowable variation around this measurement. However, the context doesn't mention any tolerance range, just the exact value of 75 cm. \n\nLooking further, in other sections like page 96 discussing the discharge bushing height, there's a specification of 1.0 mm with some consequences if it's more or less, but that's a different measurement. The question specifically refers to the distance from the vanes to the ground/crop, which is only stated as 75 cm without any tolerance mentioned. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide a tolerance (like ± a certain amount), the answer should reflect that the exact required distance is 75 cm, and there's no stated tolerance. The user asked for the tolerance, so if there's none specified, the answer might be that it's exactly 75 cm with no allowed variation. But the question is about the tolerance, so if the context doesn't mention a range, the answer would be that the tolerance isn't provided, but the required distance is 75 cm. However, the user's question is specifically about the tolerance. Since the context says \"must be 75 cm\" without mentioning a range, maybe the tolerance is zero, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, the answer is that the required distance is exactly 75 cm, so the tolerance isn't given, but according to the context, it's strictly 75. Since the user is asking for the tolerance, and the context doesn't state a range, perhaps the answer is \"75 cm\" as the exact value with no tolerance specified. Wait, but the question is about the tolerance, not the exact value. Since the context doesn't mention a tolerance (like ±0.5 cm or something), the correct answer would be that there's no tolerance mentioned, so the required distance is exactly 75 cm. But the user is asking for the tolerance, so maybe the answer is \"Not found in context\" because the tolerance (allowed variation) isn't stated. Wait, but the question might be a trick. Let me check again. The exact text says \"must be 75 cm\". So the tolerance is that it has to be exactly 75 cm. But in engineering terms, sometimes \"must be X\" implies a tolerance unless specified otherwise. However, the context here doesn't give a range. Therefore, the answer is that the required distance is 75 cm, but the tolerance isn't specified. Since the question asks for the tolerance, and the context doesn't mention it, the answer should be \"Not found in context\". Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The question is about the tolerance for that distance. The context says \"the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" There's no mention of a range or tolerance. So the answer is that the tolerance isn't provided. Therefore, the correct response is \"Not found in context\" or perhaps the tolerance is zero, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another part. Wait, looking at page 96, there's a mention of 1.0 mm for the discharge bushing, but that's a different measurement. The user's question is specifically about the distance from the vanes to the ground/crop. Since that's only stated as 75 cm with no tolerance, the answer is that the tolerance isn't mentioned. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context\" or perhaps the exact value is 75 cm, but the question is about tolerance. Since the user's instructions say to answer based on the context and if unsure, say \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\", I think the correct answer here is that the tolerance isn't specified, so \"Not found in context\".\n</think>\n\nThe context specifies that the distance from the bottom of the vanes to the ground or crop \"must be 75 cm.\" No tolerance range (e.g., ±X cm) is provided in the text. \n\n<answer>\n75 cm\n</answer>\n\nWait, the question asks for the **tolerance**, not the exact value.

The context explicitly states 3 m/s as the maximum for the tray test. Since the question is about when spreading quality becomes unacceptable, this 3 m/s is the threshold. The context doesn't mention any other wind speed limits elsewhere, so this must be the answer.\n\nI need to ensure there's no other mention of wind speed that might conflict.

The points listed there include checking roadworthiness, lights, brakes, setting parts to transport mode, checking weight distribution, mounting front weights, etc. I don't see any mention of tire pressure here. \n\nMoving to page 14, it's about safety and calculating axle loads.

However, there's no direct mention of adjusting driving speed or a percentage reduction here.\n\nNext, I check page 107, which has a spreading chart and an example calculation. The example uses a driving speed of 8 km/h. The calculation shows how to determine the flow rate based on width, speed, and application rate. But the example doesn't discuss changing speed for border spreading. The question is about adjusting speed to compensate the application rate during border spreading. \n\nLooking again through the text on both pages, there's a note that during border spreading, the control system doesn't do automatic calibration, so the application rate might deviate.

The first part mentions driving along the field edge, but I don't see a specific distance here. \n\nMoving to Page 98, which is about tramline patterns with ExactLine. The context says: \"Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) when doing boundary track spreading with ExactLine (optional extra).\" There's also a note to set the first way at half the working width from the edge. The phrase \"1/2 X meters\" seems important here. The X likely represents the working width, so half of that would be the distance. \n\nPage 99 discusses the hydraulic plate method, but the first path there is along the outermost work area, not specifying a half-width. Page 103 and 104 also mention similar points but the key detail is on Page 98. \n\nThe question is about the first path's distance. The exact instruction on Page 98 says the first path is set at half the working width (1/2 X meters) from the field edge. Since the question asks for the distance tolerance, the answer should be half the working width, expressed as 1/2 X meters. However, the user wants the exact value from the text. The context uses \"1/2 X meters\" where X is the working width. But the question might be expecting a numerical value. Wait, maybe X is a variable here, so the answer is \"half the working width\" or \"1/2 X meters\". Since the context states it explicitly, that's the exact info. The user might need the exact phrase from the text. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"half the working width (1/2 X meters)\" as per Page 98.\n</think>\n\nhalf the working width (1/2 X meters)",

The context mentions pages 120 and 121 under \"Storing the machine.\" Let me look there. \n\nOn page 120, the instructions mention placing wheel chocks in front of the parking wheels if the machine is equipped with them. The steps include driving the tractor forward about 200 mm, disconnecting plugs and hoses, and using wheel chocks. There's also a note about using a firm, stable ramp like a pawl. However, there's no mention of slope angles here. The context talks about using wheel chocks to prevent rolling but doesn't specify any angle limitations.\n\nLooking through other pages, like pages 14-17, which are about safety and axle loads, there's no information about slope angles either. The question is about the parking support's ability to handle a 10-degree slope. The context doesn't provide details on the maximum slope angle the parking support can handle. The only related advice is to use wheel chocks, but without specific angle data, I can't confirm if 10 degrees is acceptable.\n\nSince the context doesn't mention any slope angles or the parking support's capacity regarding inclines, the answer should be that the information isn't found in the provided context.

The context includes pages 118, 119, 121, etc., which discuss storing and maintaining the machine. \n\nLooking at page 121 under \"Preparation for winter storage,\" it mentions steps like cleaning, lubricating, checking seals, using preservative grease on white parts like piston rods, and ensuring electrical components aren't set up with water. But the question is about spring preparation, which might involve steps after storage. \n\nWait, the question is about the start of the spring season, so maybe the answer is in the preparation steps before storage, but reversed? Or perhaps there's a section about preparing after storage. Let me check again.\n\nIn the context, page 121 says \"Paint any damaged paintwork.\" That's a step beyond cleaning and lubrication. Also, it mentions \"Provide white parts such as piston rods of hydraulic cylinders with preservative grease...\" but that's for storage. However, when preparing for work in spring, maybe the reverse steps are needed. Wait, the question is about what to do at the start of spring to prepare it for work. The context might not explicitly mention spring preparation, but the winter storage steps might imply that after storage, you need to do certain things. \n\nLooking at page 121 again: \"Paint any damaged paintwork\" is listed as a step before storage. But when preparing for work, maybe that's part of the preparation. Also, \"Lubricate and oil all points once again to ensure conservation\" is part of the storage steps, but the question is about beyond cleaning and lubrication. \n\nWait, the question says \"beyond cleaning and lubrication,\" so the answer should be other steps mentioned. On page 121, after cleaning and lubricating again, it says to paint damaged paintwork and to provide white parts with preservative grease. But since the question is about preparing for work in spring, perhaps the steps would include checking those areas again. However, the context might not explicitly state spring preparation steps. \n\nAlternatively, looking at page 118, under \"Storing the machine,\" the steps are to lubricate, clean, lubricate again. But the question is about the start of the season (spring), so maybe the steps are the reverse. However, the context doesn't have a section for preparing after storage. \n\nWait, the question is about what should be done at the start of spring to prepare it for work, beyond cleaning and lubrication.

Also, \"Provide white parts... with preservative grease or inject... preserving liquid\" but that's for storage. However, when preparing for work, maybe you need to check those parts again. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be \"Paint any damaged paintwork\" as that's an additional step mentioned in the preparation steps before storage. Since the question is about preparing for work, perhaps the steps are similar but in reverse. The context might not explicitly state spring prep, but the closest instruction is on page 121 where after cleaning and lubrication, you paint damaged paintwork. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Paint any damaged paintwork.\"\n</think>\n\nPaint any damaged paintwork.",

The user is asking how many operational hours vanes typically last before needing replacement, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The mention of \"vanes\" appears on pages 125, 43, and 44. \n\nOn page 125, under the \"Maintenance intervals\" section, item 3 and 4 mention checking the condition of the agitator axle, vanes, etc., but the intervals listed there are things like after the first 10 hours, weekly, every 100 hours, or annually. However, the specific entries for vanes (item 3 and 4) have a checkmark under \"min. 1 x per year\" and \"If worn\". But that's about when to check them, not when to replace.\n\nLooking at page 43, which has detailed info on vanes. The section talks about even wear and exchanging vanes over time to ensure they wear evenly. There's a tip suggesting exchanging the first vane with a fixed one and then later with the central vane. But there's no specific hour count mentioned here. It's more about maintenance practices to prolong their life rather than a set timeframe.\n\nPage 44 is mentioned in the context but there's no content provided here except the header. So nothing there.\n\nThe question is about how many hours until replacement. The maintenance intervals don't specify a replacement interval in hours for vanes. The closest is \"If worn\" which is a condition-based replacement, not time-based. Since the context doesn't provide a specific number of hours, the answer should reflect that the information isn't present. The user instructions say to answer \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the context doesn't specify a set number of operational hours before replacement; it depends on wear.

I need to find the exact answer from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context pages given. The question mentions connectors and a suitable lubricant. Let's check each page. \n\nStarting with Page 118, the main topic is storing and cleaning the machine, mentioning lubrication steps but not specifying the type of lubricant. It refers to lubricating grease nipples and mentions the \"Lubricating points\" on page 126, but the question is about connectors. \n\nMoving to Page 119, this seems to be an index or table of contents. The entry for \"lubricating points\" is on page 126, but again, not sure if that's relevant here. The connectors are listed on page 128. \n\nPage 128 is where the answer might be. The section titled \"Maintenance\" under \"Connectors\" says: \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding...\" Here, it mentions using a \"suitable lubricant\" but doesn't specify the type. Wait, the exact wording is \"Apply a suitable lubricant\"—so the context doesn't name a specific type like grease or oil. The instruction says to be precise. \n\nLooking again, maybe another part of the context? Page 129 is empty. The other pages don't mention connectors with specifics. The question is about the type, but the context only says \"a suitable lubricant\" without naming it. The answer might be that it's not specified, but the user wants exact info from context. Since the context doesn't give the exact type, the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". Wait, but the instruction says to answer in English and if unsure, use those terms. \n\nWait, the context on page 128 says \"Apply a suitable lubricant\" but doesn't name it. The question asks for the type, which isn't provided. So the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". Alternatively, maybe \"oil\" is mentioned? Let me check again. The same paragraph says \"oiling the connectors will prevent...\" So maybe \"oil\" is the answer? Wait, the sentence says \"Apply a suitable lubricant... Oiling the connectors...\" Here, \"oiling\" might imply that oil is the type. But the first part says \"lubricant\", which could be oil. The exact wording is a bit ambiguous. \n\nWait, the exact text: \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding...\" So the first sentence says to use a lubricant, and the second sentence says \"oiling\" which is applying oil. So maybe the suitable lubricant is oil? The answer might be \"oil\". But the first part says \"lubricant\" and the second clarifies that oiling is needed. So the answer is \"oil\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"lubricant\" here is general, but the example given is oil. Since the question asks for the type, the context says \"suitable lubricant\" but the next sentence uses \"oiling\", so perhaps the answer is \"oil\". \n\nWait, but the exact instruction says to extract the exact information. The context says \"Apply a suitable lubricant...\" but doesn't name the type. The next sentence says \"oiling\" which is a form of lubrication with oil. So maybe the answer is \"oil\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"a suitable lubricant\" but that's too generic. The user wants the exact type. Since the context doesn't specify beyond \"suitable lubricant\" and mentions oiling, perhaps the answer is \"oil\". \n\nHmm, but the question is about the type. The context says \"suitable lubricant\" but the next sentence says \"oiling\", so maybe the answer is \"oil\". Let me check again. \n\nThe exact lines: \n\n\"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding and becoming difficult to use.\"\n\nSo \"oiling\" is part of the explanation. So the recommended lubricant is oil. Therefore, the answer is \"oil\".\n</think>\n\noil",

I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context pages mentioned. The question is about the agitator axle seal, so I should focus on sections related to maintenance or replacement of that part. \n\nLooking at Page 140 under \"Replacing agitator axle seal\", there's a paragraph that says: \"The agitator axle is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent fertiliser granule loss along the agitator axle. The seal must be replaced every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours.\" \n\nHere, it mentions the seal is made of plastic. The question is asking for the material specification. The context doesn't provide any additional details like the type of plastic (e.g., PVC, PP, etc.) or specific standards. The only specification given is that it's a plastic seal. \n\nI should check other pages to be thorough. Page 141 talks about metal seal rings but doesn't mention the plastic seal's material. Page 126 and 127 discuss lubrication points but not materials. \n\nSince the context only states it's a plastic seal without further specifics, the answer should be that the material is plastic. There's no mention of other specifications like thickness or part numbers. The user wants exact info from the text, so \"plastic\" is the only answer here.\n</think>\n\nThe 'plastic seal' is specified as a plastic material in the context. \n\nAnswer: plastic",

The question is about the metal seal rings, so I should focus on the sections that mention them. \n\nLooking at Page 141, under the Maintenance section, there are steps involving the metal seal rings. The first bullet point says, \"Remove the metal seal rings.\" The context here directly refers to them as metal seal rings. The question is asking for the material, which in this case is explicitly stated as \"metal.\" \n\nI need to check if there's any other mention that might specify a different material or additional details, but from the given text, every reference to the seal rings on that page uses \"metal\" as the material. There's no mention of another material like plastic or any other type. \n\nOther pages like 126, 127, 139, 140 don't seem relevant here. Page 139 talks about discharge bushings and dosing mechanisms but not the seal rings' material. \n\nTherefore, the answer is straightforward: the material is metal.

It mentions the plugs but no length.\n\nPage 32 discusses ISOBUS tractor connection and mentions the \"IM Tellus Input\" cable as a standard item, but again, no length specified. There's a part about a special cable set for speed sensors, but that's about type, not length.\n\nPage 33 and 143 describe the IsoMatch Tellus GO control box and mention the 9-pin in-cab cable for ISOBUS tractors.

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of the drain kit and its drain rate.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections. The main part towards the end lists technical specifications for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. There's a section with rows numbered 0 to 10, under \"General\". The rows mention hopper capacity in liters: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. But that's the hopper's content, not the drain rate.\n\nFurther up, there's a list of items with numbers 0 to 43. Entry 33 mentions \"Disconnect machine\" and 35 \"Winter storage\". Entry 33 and 34 don't seem relevant. Then entry 33 is \"Disconnect machine\" and 34 is \"machine\", but nothing about drain rate. \n\nLooking at entry 33: \"Disconnect machine\" page 119, and 35 is Winter storage. Then entry 43: \"Drain kit\" with a reference to page 149. The context might have a mention on page 149, but the provided text doesn't include that page's content.

So the drain kit is mentioned in line 43, pointing to page 149. However, the provided context doesn't include page 149's content. The user's context ends with the technical specs table which doesn't mention drain rate. \n\nSince the context provided doesn't have any numbers or data about the drain rate of the drain kit, the answer would be that it's not found in the given context. The question specifically asks for the drain rate in liters per minute, but there's no such value present here.
