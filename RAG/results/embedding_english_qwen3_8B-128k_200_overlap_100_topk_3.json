Also, the connection point on the central gearbox and the terminal selection. \n\nWait, the context says, \"The working width is adjusted with: \u00b7 the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and \u00b7 the discharge point.\" Then later, \"The working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox.\" So combining these, the working width is determined by the coupling shaft connection point (specifically the terminal selected) and the discharge point. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the machine's working width is determined by the connection point for the coupling shaft (turtle/hare terminal) and the discharge point. The exact wording from the context is: \"The working width is adjusted with: \u00b7 the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and \u00b7 the discharge point.\" But the question is about what determines it, so the answer is those two factors. Also, the terminal selection based on the spreading chart. \n\nBut the answer needs to be precise. The context says the working width is determined by the connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox and the discharge point. So the answer is those two factors. The exact answer from the context is: \"The working width is adjusted with: \u00b7 the correct connection point for the coupling, shaft with the PTO speed and \u00b7 the discharge point.\" But the user wants the answer to be as precise as possible. So the answer should be: \"The working width is determined by the connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox and the discharge point.\" Also, the terminal (turtle or hare) selected based on the desired working width from the spreading chart. \n\nWait, the context says, \"Which terminal (turtle or hare) you need to use is listed in the (online) spreading chart and depends on the desired working width.\" So the terminal selection is part of the connection point. Therefore, the answer should include the connection point (terminal selection) and the discharge point. \n\nSo the answer is: The working width is determined by the connection point for the coupling shaft (turtle/hare terminal) and the discharge point. But the exact wording from the context is: \"The working width is adjusted with: \u00b7 the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and \u00b7 the discharge point.\" So the answer should be those two factors. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: The working width is determined by the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and the discharge point. But the context also mentions the central gearbox connection point. Wait, the context says, \"The working width of the spreader is also determined",

Wait, but the question is about application rate in kg/min, not flowrate. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a part that says: \"We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.\" So flowrate here is the key. But the question is about application rate. Wait, maybe there's a confusion between flowrate and application rate here.

However, the question is about application rate in kg/min. Wait, maybe there's a mix-up between flowrate and application rate.

But that's in kg/ha, not kg/min. The question is about kg/min. \n\nWait, the first part says \"flowrate is less than 40 kg/min\" advises using the fine application. So the answer might be 40 kg/min. But the question is about application rate, not flowrate. However, the context might be using flowrate and application rate interchangeably here. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\nThe question is: \"Below which application rate in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?\" The context says: \"We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.\" So the answer is 40 kg/min. But the question is about application rate, not flowrate. However, the context might have a mistake or use the terms interchangeably. Since the context directly states flowrate less than 40 kg/min, but the question is about application rate, maybe the answer is 40 kg/min.

But the first instruction says flowrate less than 40 kg/min. So which one is correct? The question is about application rate, but the context uses flowrate. Maybe the answer is 40 kg/min. However, the user might have a typo. Alternatively, the answer is 40 kg/min. Let me check again. The first sentence says \"flowrate is less than 40 kg/min\" advises using the fine application. So the answer is 40 kg/min. But the question is about application rate. Maybe the context uses flowrate and application rate interchangeably. Therefore, the answer is 40 kg/min.

The 1250 mm is about the hopper rim to ground, not the spreader to platform. Therefore, the answer should be 200 mm.\n</think>\n\n[The maximum distance between the spreader and loading platform is 200 mm.]",

There's a part that says, \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo, the key here is that the first trough (which is in the imaginative ditch) can't exceed 10% of the middle trough's quantity.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the context.\n\nThe context states that the quantity in the first trough (imaginative ditch) must be a maximum of 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the middle trough's quantity is 100%, and the first trough is 10%. Therefore, the maximum allowed loss in the ditch (which is the first trough) is 10% of the middle trough's quantity.

The middle trough's quantity is the reference point. The loss in the ditch (first trough) is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the maximum allowed loss is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. But the question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough\". That might be a misinterpretation. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum loss allowed in the ditch (which is the first trough), which is 10% of the middle trough's quantity.

Therefore, the maximum allowed loss in the ditch (first trough) is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. But the question is asking about the maximum loss allowed in the middle trough.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the maximum allowed loss in the ditch, which is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. But the question says \"the maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough\". That seems to be a misstatement.

However, the user wants it extremely precise. Let me check if there's any other info. No, the rest is about low doses and filling during spreading.

Scanning through the text, there's a row in the table where the type is listed as 'mineral'. The columns are Type Operation, pattern, Surface. For the mineral type, the pattern column says \"angular, with sharp angles and edges\". The surface is described as \"very rough\". \n\nThe question specifically asks for the pattern, so I should focus on the 'pattern' column. The answer should be exactly what's written there. I need to make sure there's no confusion with other types. The other entries like Granular, prills, etc., have different patterns, but the mineral's pattern is clearly stated. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of 'mineral' elsewhere in the context. The rest of the text talks about distribution, spreading charts, and other types, but nothing else about the mineral's pattern. So the answer is definitely the angular description. \n\nThe user wants a precise, concise answer, so just the pattern part without extra details. The answer should be in English and match the format exactly. No need to mention the surface unless the question asked for it.

The context has two main sections: one about stainless steel tightening torques and another about steel tightening torques. The question specifies \"stainless steel,\" so I should focus on the first section.\n\nLooking at the first section, under \"Stainless steel tightening torques,\" there's a table. The rows are labeled with numbers 0, 1, etc., and the columns are M5, M6, etc. The friction coefficients are mentioned as 0.10 and 0.20.

Looking at the table, under the M6 column, the values for 0.20 friction are listed. Let me check the numbers. The line for M6 under the 0.20 friction is 12.2 Nm.

Wait, the first line (0) is for M5, then the next line (1) is for M6. The numbers after M6 are 6.3, 9.9, 12.2, 8.4, 13.2, 16.3. But how are these columns structured? The original context might have columns for different friction coefficients. The first part mentions \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20.\" So maybe the first set of numbers is for 0.10 friction, and the next for 0.20. But the exact alignment is a bit unclear. However, the user is asking for 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction. \n\nLooking at the line for M6, the third value (since 0.10 is first, 0.20 is second?) might be 12.2 Nm. Wait, the line for M6 is \"1                         M6                   6.3                   9.9                  12.2                   8.4                  13.2                  16.3\". If the first number after M6 is 6.3 for 0.10, then 9.9 for 0.20? Or maybe the numbers are for different friction coefficients. Alternatively, the first set of numbers (6.3, 9.9, 12.2) might be for 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and the next set (8.4, 13.2, 16.3) for another quality? Wait, the initial part says \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what they should do if the fertilizer flow is blocked and which page to look at. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the context provided. The context has several entries, each with an issue and a solution. The second entry under \"Use in the field\" mentions that if the flow is blocked, the solution is to clean the machine well after each use and replace the agitator if worn. The page number associated with this is 118.\n\nWait, the question is about the page number. Let me check again. The context has entries numbered 5, 6, 7, then \"Use in the field\" with stoppage, then page numbers like 116 and 118. The entry for blocked flow is under the \"Use in the field\" section, and the page number listed there is 118. \n\nSo the answer should mention both the action (clean the machine and replace agitator) and the page number 118. But the user's question is specifically about what to do and which page to look at. The context says \"at what page should I look?\" So the answer should include the page number where the solution is found. \n\nLooking at the context, the entry for blocked flow is on page 118. Therefore, the answer is to clean the machine and replace the agitator, and refer to page 118. But the user might be asking for the page number where the solution is located. The instruction says to extract the exact information. The context says \"Clean the machine well after each use. Replace the agitator if it is worn out\" under the entry for blocked flow, which is on page 118. So the answer should be that you should clean the machine and replace the agitator, and look at page 118. But the question is phrased as \"at what page should I look?\" So the answer should specify the page number. However, the exact answer from the context is that when the flow is blocked, the solution is to clean the machine and replace the agitator, and the page number is 118. Therefore, the answer should be: \"Clean the machine well after each use. Replace the agitator if it is worn out. Page 118.\" But the user might want the page number as the answer. Wait, the question is \"at what page should I look?\" So the answer is page 118. But the instruction says to extract the exact information. The context says \"If you have not found any damage, the failure is probably due to stoppage from an encrusted layer of fertiliser. \uf034 Try to reduce the size of the lump or encrusted layer with an object such as a stick, screwdriver or vane. If you open the filters to reduce the lump or encrusted layer from the top side, you should block them to prevent unwanted closing.\" Wait, that's under the \"Use in the field\" section. But the entry for blocked flow is under the second entry (number 6) which says \"The flow of the fertiliser is blocked\" and the solution is to clean the machine and replace the agitator, with page 118. So the answer is to clean the machine and replace the agitator, and refer to page 118. But the user's question is asking for the page number. However, the exact answer from the context is that when the flow is blocked, the solution is to clean the machine and replace the agitator, and the page number is 118. Therefore, the answer should be: \"Clean the machine well after each use. Replace the agitator if it is worn out. Page 118.\" But the user might be asking for the page number as the answer. Wait, the question is \"at what page should I look?\" So the answer is page 118. But the context also mentions that the solution is to clean the machine and replace the agitator. So the answer should include both the action and the page number. However, the user's question is phrased as \"What should I do if the flow of the fertiliser is blocked, at what page should I look?\" So the answer should include both the action and the page. But the answer format requires a concise answer. The context says that for blocked flow, the solution is to clean the machine and replace the agitator, and the page number is 118. Therefore, the answer is: \"Clean the machine well after each use. Replace the agitator if it is worn out. Page 118.\" But the user might be looking for the page number as the answer.

The user is asking, \"For what other kind of connections can the IM Tellus Input cable be used?\" So, I need to look through the provided context to find information about other connections that the IM Tellus Input cable can handle.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for mentions of \"IM Tellus Input cable\" or similar terms. The context mentions \"Input IM Tellus\" cable several times. Let me check each relevant section.\n\nIn the first part, it says, \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" Then later, there's a section about the IsoMatch power cable set for non-ISO tractors, which is needed if the tractor doesn't have the ISO 11786 in cab connection. It mentions that other connections are the same as the \"Input IM Tellus\" cable set. \n\nAnother part says, \"Various cables and extension cables for many different types of radar are available.\" Also, there's a mention of the \"Sensor input IM Tellus\" for connecting the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch control box. \n\nSo, putting this together, the IM Tellus Input cable is used for connections like ISO 11786 in cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), video input, and radar or wheel sensor connections via the Sensor input IM Tellus. Wait, but the question is about \"other kind of connections\" beyond the standard ones. The standard Input IM Tellus cable is used for ISO 11786 in cab, lights, ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. Then, the Sensor input IM Tellus is for radar or wheel sensor. But the question is asking for other connections that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for ISO 11786 in cab, lights, ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. But the question is about \"other kind of connections\" beyond that. Wait, the user might be asking for other connections besides the standard ones. Let me check again.\n\nThe context says that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for the standard connections. Then, the Sensor input IM Tellus is an optional cable for connecting radar or wheel sensor. So, the Input IM Tellus cable is used for the standard connections, and the Sensor input is for radar/sensor. But the question is about other connections that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Input IM Tell's cable can be used for ISO 11786 in cab, lights, ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. But the question is asking for \"other kind of connections\" beyond that. Wait, the user might be referring to the standard Input IM Tellus cable's other uses. Let me re-read the context.\n\nThe context says: \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" Then later, \"A connection set is supplied as a standard item with the IsoMatch for: \u00b7 ISO 11786 In cab \u00b7 lights and ignition \u00b7 Tractor CAN (optional plug specific to the tractor required) \u00b7 Video input.\" So the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those four connections. Then, the Sensor input IM Tellus is for radar or wheel sensor. So the answer would be that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for ISO 11786 in cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. But the question is asking for \"other kind of connections\" that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for those four connections. But the user is asking for \"other kind of connections\" beyond the standard ones. Wait, perhaps the answer is that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for ISO 11786 in cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. So the answer should list those. But the question is phrased as \"other kind of connections\" which might imply that the standard ones are already known, and the user is asking for additional ones. However, based on the context, the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those four. The Sensor input is a separate cable. Therefore, the answer is that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for ISO 11786 in cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. So the answer should list those.\n</think>\n\nThe IM Tellus Input cable can be used for ISO 11786 in cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input connections.",

The entire context focuses on hydraulic operations, like disconnecting the connector, adjusting settings, and using the spreading chart. \n\nSince the question is about pneumatic actuation and the context only discusses hydraulic systems, the answer should be that it's not mentioned. The user might be confusing hydraulic with pneumatic, but based on the given text, there's no information supporting pneumatic actuation. Therefore, the correct response is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\".\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The context provided has some technical information about machinery, probably related to a spreader or similar equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to find the exact part in the context that answers this. The context mentions that if there's damage to those parts, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The reason given there is that the agitator is probably damaged too, and you need to repair the damage before continuing. But the question is about why the damage is caused by a hard object. \n\nLooking through the context again, there's a part that says: \"If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. The agitator is probably damaged too.\" Wait, that's the same sentence. So the context states that the failure (damage) is caused by a hard object. But the question is asking why that's the case. However, the context doesn't explain the reason why a hard object causes the damage. It just states that if there's damage, it's likely due to a hard object. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The context mentions that if you can't see the cause, you remove the vanes to check the discharge opening. Then, passing an object like a screwdriver through the discharge opening to feel for objects or damage. If there's damage, it's likely a hard object. But the context doesn't explain why a hard object would cause the damage. It just states that the presence of damage indicates a hard object as the cause. \n\nSo the answer is based on the context's direct statement. The question is asking for the reason why damage is caused by a hard object. However, the context doesn't provide a reason; it just states that the damage is most likely caused by a hard object. Therefore, the answer should be the exact sentence from the context: \"If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object.\" But the user wants a concise answer. Wait, the question is phrased as \"Why is damage... most likely caused by a hard object?\" The context doesn't explain the 'why' but states that the damage is caused by a hard object. So the answer is that the context says the failure is caused by a hard object. Therefore, the answer is that the damage is caused by a hard object. But the user wants the answer to be based on the context. Since the context directly states that the failure is caused by a hard object, the answer is that the damage is caused by a hard object. But the question is phrased as \"Why is damage... caused by a hard object?\" So the answer is the context's statement that the failure is caused by a hard object. Therefore, the answer is that the damage is caused by a hard object. But the user wants the answer to be precise and based on the context.

The user is asking about the tolerance for the measured distance from the bottom of the vanes to the ground or crop, in centimeters. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context mentions several steps and measurements related to setting the height. The key sentence here is: \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" \n\nNow, the question is about the tolerance. But wait, the context states that the distance must be 75 cm, but does it mention any tolerance range? Let me check again. The context says \"must be 75 cm\" without specifying a range or tolerance. There's no mention of plus or minus a certain amount. All the instructions are about setting it to exactly 75 cm. \n\nThe user is asking for the tolerance, which implies a range around 75 cm. However, the context doesn't provide any information about acceptable variations. It only specifies the required distance. Therefore, based on the given context, there's no tolerance mentioned. The answer should be that the required distance is exactly 75 cm, and since tolerance isn't specified, the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"What is the tolerance for 'measured distance...'\", so if the context doesn't mention any tolerance, then the correct response is that it's not found.

The context is about preparing a machine and tractor for transport on public roads. It lists various checks and steps to ensure safety. Let me go through each point.\n\nLooking at the items, there are several checks like ensuring lights are working, checking brakes, verifying the quick coupling ropes, fitting extra lighting, checking folding parts and their locks, setting parts to transport mode, checking weight distribution, mounting front weights, checking headroom, lowering the power lift, locking the control lever, checking lights again, dosing units closed, switching off the control box, removing dirt, and securing control devices.\n\nWait, the question is about tire pressure range.

But the context mentions reducing the application rate by 25% if you select a gear that ensures the same speed as the normal PTO shaft. However, the actual speed reduction percentage isn't directly stated. The PTO shaft rpm is mentioned as 540 rpm minus 25% equals 400 rpm.

The context has two main sections: one about the spreader's functions and another about using ExactLine with tramlines.\n\nIn the section about using ExactLine with tramlines, there's a part that says: \"Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) when doing boundary track spreading with ExactLine (optional extra).\" Then, under \"Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B):\" it mentions driving the first path with the tractor's middle about 2 metres from the field edge. \n\nThe question is about the 'first path' distance. The key here is to determine which part refers to the first path. The first scenario with ExactLine mentions driving half the working width (1/2 X meters) from the field edge. However, the second scenario (situation B) specifies 2 metres for the first path. \n\nBut the question is about the general case. Wait, the user might be referring to the first path in the context of border spreading. The context mentions two methods: one-sided boundary spreading and boundary track spreading with ExactLine. \n\nIn the \"Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B)\" section, the first path is set at 2 metres from the field edge. However, the question is about the distance tolerance. The answer might be 2 meters as per that section. But I need to check if there's a specific mention of tolerance. The text says \"Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 7,5%.\" Wait, no, the distance is 2 meters. \n\nWait, the exact text says: \"Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge.\" So the distance is 2 meters. The question is about the distance tolerance, which might refer to this 2 meters. However, the term \"tolerance\" isn't used in the context. The user might be using \"tolerance\" to mean the required distance. \n\nAlternatively, in the ExactLine section, it's half the working width (1/2 X meters), but that's for boundary track spreading. The question is about the first path for border spreading. The answer is likely 2 meters as per situation B. But the user might be referring to the first path in general. However, the context mentions two scenarios: one with tramlines and one without. The answer depends on which scenario. \n\nThe question is about border spreading, which could be either method. However, the first path in the situation B (without tramlines) is 2 meters. The other method (ExactLine) might have a different distance.

They mention removing and replacing the metal seal rings, checking their condition, and ensuring proper installation. However, I don't see any specific numbers or mention of how long the seal ring lasts before needing replacement. The context provides procedures for maintenance and replacement but doesn't specify a lifespan in hours. \n\nThe question is about the typical lifespan, which implies there's a standard or expected duration. Since the context doesn't provide any figures or references to operational hours, I can't extract that information. The answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions. I need to make sure I'm not missing any part of the text. Let me scan again.

The context is about maintenance instructions for a machine, specifically involving adjusting the dosing mechanism and discharge bushing. \n\nLooking for mentions of the 'small crack of light', I find a section under \"Setting the dosing baffles\". It says: \"If the dosing plates are mounted in the correct positions, you will see a small crack of light when the dosing openings are closed.\" \n\nBut wait, the question is about the dimension in millimeters. The context mentions a 1.0 mm distance between the discharge bush and the spreading disc, but that's a different part. The 'small crack of light' is described as a visual indicator, not a specific measurement. \n\nThe context doesn't explicitly state the exact millimeter dimension for the crack. It only mentions that when the baffles are correctly positioned, you see a small crack of light. There's no numerical value provided for that crack's width. \n\nSince the question asks for the dimension in millimeters and the context doesn't provide that specific number, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\".
