The type of grease mentioned is not specified, but it can be inferred to be a general-purpose grease or multi-purpose grease.\n\nThe text does not provide specific information about the exact type of grease. However, based on common practices in the industry, a suitable option would be:\n\n* Shell Rodina 2 (or equivalent)\n* Castrol GS2\n* SAE 80W-90\n\nThese are general-purpose greases that can be used for lubricating nipples and other applications.\n\nIt is essential to note that the specific type of grease should be chosen based on the equipment's specifications, manufacturer's recommendations, or the application requirements.",
