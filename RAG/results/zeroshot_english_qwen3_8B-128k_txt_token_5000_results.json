Looking through the pages, specifically page 32 and 33 mention the IsoMatch control box and how it connects with the tractor. \n\nOn page 32, there's a section about adapting non-ISO tractors with the IsoMatch power cable set. It says that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you can add the IsoMatch power cable set. Then, the driving speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch. \n\nWait, but the question is about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So the answer must involve using the power cable set. Also, there's a mention of connecting the speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch. \n\nLooking at page 32 again: \"If speed is not measured on the (trailed) machine, but via the tractor, the speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics.\" \n\nSo the method is connecting the speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch. Additionally, the power cable set is used to make the tractor ISOBUS ready. \n\nPutting it together, the answer should state that the tractor's driving speed is transmitted to the IsoMatch via the IsoMatch power cable set, which enables ISOBUS communication, allowing the speed data to be sent through the ISOBUS connection. \n\nWait, but the exact answer might be more specific. The context says that if the tractor lacks ISOBUS, you use the IsoMatch power cable set to make it ISOBUS ready, and then the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS. So the answer is using the IsoMatch power cable set to enable ISOBUS, then the speed is sent through ISOBUS. \n\nBut the question is specifically about how the speed is transmitted when there's no ISOBUS.

Specifically, it says: \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" This seems relevant because the question is about the height above the troughs, which are part of the spreading setup.\n\nAdditionally, on page 91, there's a mention of the tray test where the disc height is set to 75 cm above the troughs. The exact line says: \"During the tray test the disc height above the troughs was set to 75 cm.\" This directly answers the question about the ExactLine testing. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about the ExactLine. The ExactLine is mentioned on page 89 and 91. On page 91, under \"Setting the spreading height back to the tray test,\" it states that the disc height was set to 75 cm above the troughs during the tray test.

In order to comply with the standards the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo the key sentence here is that the first trough (which is in the ditch) can have a maximum of 10% of the middle trough's quantity. That means the loss is 10% of the middle trough's amount. Therefore, the maximum allowed loss is 10%.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of this percentage elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, like page 91, there's a similar mention: \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough... must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track.\" So this confirms the 10% figure.\n\nThe question is about the maximum fertilizer loss in the middle trough's quantity.

Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.\"\n\nSo the danger here is that the machine continues to run due to inertia even after the PTO shaft is disengaged. The reason is inertia, which keeps the machine moving until the parts stop. The answer needs to be precise and concise, directly quoting the context. I should make sure not to add any extra information beyond what's stated.

Looking at the pages, I remember seeing something about high-pressure cleaners on page 118. Let me check that section again.\n\nHere's the relevant part: \"When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes. Furthermore, do not set up electrical components. Water can cause electrical failures. INDICATION [Image]\" \n\nWait, that doesn't mention the pressure. Let me check other sections. Oh, on page 121, there's a note about using a high-pressure cleaner: \"TIP When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.\" Still no pressure value.\n\nWait, going back to page 118, there's a section under \"Be careful while cleaning with high pressure cleaners\" which says: \" Only use low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.\" There it is! The maximum allowable pressure is 80 bar. That's the exact figure mentioned.

On page 24, it mentions that the spreader has two actuators to set the application rate and working width. It also talks about fine dosing settings and normal dosing. \n\nIn the section about fine application, it states that low application rates require a small dosing opening.

This setup is meant to provide accurate, reliable flow at low rates and prevent blockages. However, there's no mention of cost here.\n\nLooking further, on page 26, there's a part about adjusting the working width and application rates. It mentions that changing the application rate or fertilizer type only requires entering new flowrate values and adjusting settings.

Since there's no explicit mention of small gardens, but the technique is described for fields, maybe the answer is that it's suitable, but the context doesn't specify gardens. However, the user might infer that since it's for fields, it could be adapted for gardens.

Since the question is whether it can be, and the context only describes it as hydraulic, the answer would be that it's not pneumatically actuated. However, the user's instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" if unsure. But since the context clearly states it's hydraulic, the answer is no.

The user is asking about the maximum height the fertilizer flies when spreading without GEOCONTROL headland. \n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant part of the context. The question is specifically about the height without using GEOCONTROL. Let me scan through the context.\n\nLooking at the pages, on page 100, there's a section about \"Start spreading\" and \"Overlap on the headland\". It mentions setting the height to 75 cm from the ground or crops. But that's a general setting, not specifically about the fertilizer's flight height.\n\nWait, maybe there's more. On page 103, under \"Hydraulic border spreading plate\", there's a mention of spreading to the field edge and adjusting the border spreading plate. But again, not directly about height.\n\nWait, the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. The context might mention the height setting for the spreader. Earlier, on page 95, it says: \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" So that's the height setting for the spreader. But is that the same as the fertilizer's flight height?\n\nWait, the fertilizer's flight height would depend on the spreader's height setting. If the spreader is set to 75 cm above the ground, then the fertilizer would be released from that height. But the question is about the maximum height, so maybe there's a specific value mentioned.\n\nLooking again, on page 100, under \"Start spreading\", it says: \"The rpm of the tractor engine... must remain constant while spreading (with regards to distributing fertiliser along the width).\" Not directly related.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is 75 cm. Because the context mentions that the spreader must be set to 75 cm from the ground or crops. That's the height the fertilizer is released from. So the maximum height would be 75 cm. But the question is about the fertilizer's flight height. If the spreader is set to 75 cm, then the fertilizer is released at that height. However, the actual flight height might be influenced by other factors like the spreader's design, but the context doesn't mention any other specific numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mention of the maximum height in another part. Let me check again. On page 107, there's a mention of spreading to the field edge with different directions, but no specific height. \n\nSo the only direct mention is the 75 cm setting. Therefore, the answer is 75 cm. But the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. If the spreader is set to 75 cm, that's the height from which the fertilizer is released. Unless there's a specific value for the maximum flight height, which isn't mentioned, the answer would be 75 cm. \n\nWait, but maybe the answer is different. Let me check again. The context says \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" So the spreader is set 75 cm above the ground. That's the height the fertilizer is released from. Therefore, the maximum height the fertilizer flies would be 75 cm.

The user specifically wants measures for road transport, so I should check if that's mentioned there.\n\nIn the \"Stopping work\" section on Page 112, the steps listed include closing the dosing units, switching off the PTO shaft, turning off the electronic control system, switching off the tractor, removing the keys, engaging the parking brake, removing remains from the crop, dirt, and stones, fixing the hopper cover, and taking all appropriate measures for road transport. The last point refers to \"Preparing the machine to be transported\" on page 93. \n\nThe question is about measures for road transport when stopping work. The direct answer from the context is that you should take all appropriate measures for road transport, as mentioned in the stopping work section. However, the exact phrasing in the context is \"Take all appropriate measures for road transport.\" So the answer should be that specific instruction.\n</think>\n\n[Take all appropriate measures for road transport.]",

I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context pages. The question is about fertiliser attracting water. Let me look for any mentions of water attraction in the context. \n\nLooking at page 114, there's a section about damage and stoppage. It mentions that \"Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks. These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.\" \n\nThat seems directly relevant. The context states that fertilisers attract water, leading to chunk formation. So the answer should be based on that sentence. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Checking other pages, like page 115 and 116, they talk about cleaning and storage but not the reason for water attraction. Page 117 mentions corrosion but not water attraction. \n\nSo the key sentence is on page 114. The answer should be concise, extracting the exact reason given in the context. The answer is that most fertilisers attract water, leading to chunk formation which can block the spreader or affect spreading patterns. But the question is why they attract water, so the answer is the first part: because they attract water, forming chunks. \n\nWait, the exact wording in the context is \"Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks.\" So the reason is that they attract water, which causes chunk formation. The answer should state that most fertilisers attract water, leading to chunk formation. But the question is asking for the reason they attract water. Wait, the context doesn't explain why they attract water, just that they do. So the answer is that they attract water, which causes chunks. But the question is why they attract water. Wait, maybe the context doesn't explain the reason, just states the fact. \n\nWait, the user's question is \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" The context says \"Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks.\" So the context states that they attract water, but doesn't explain why. However, the answer needs to be based on the context. Since the context doesn't provide a reason for the attraction, but only states that they do, then the answer would be that they attract water, but the context doesn't explain why. However, the user's question is asking for the reason, but the context only states the fact. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The context says \"Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks.\" So the answer is that they attract water, which causes chunks. But the question is why they attract water. However, the context doesn't provide a reason for the attraction; it's just a statement of fact. Therefore, the answer should be that they attract water, but the context doesn't explain why. However, the user's question is phrased as \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" implying that the context might have an explanation. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again. The context mentions that fertilisers attract water, leading to chunk formation. But the reason for the attraction isn't given. Therefore, the answer based on the context is that they attract water, but the context doesn't explain why. However, the user's question is asking for the reason, so if the context doesn't provide it, the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the user's instruction says to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. \n\nWait, but the context does state that they attract water, so the answer is that they attract water, but the question is why they do so. Since the context doesn't explain the reason, the answer would be that the context doesn't provide a reason. However, the user's question is phrased as \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" and the context says they do, but doesn't explain why. Therefore, the answer should be that the context doesn't provide a reason, so the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nBut wait, the user's instruction says to base the answer strictly on the context. If the context doesn't explain why they attract water, then the answer is that the context doesn't provide that information. However, the user's question is about the reason for attraction, and the context only states that they do. Therefore, the answer would be \"Not found in context.\" \n\nBut wait, the user's question is \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" and the context says \"Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks.\" So the context states that they attract water, but the reason isn't given.

It mentions that if there's damage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. It also states that the agitator is probably damaged too. \n\nAnother part on page 114 under \"Damage\" says that most types of fertilizer attract water and can form large chunks, which might block the spreader. However, the direct answer to the question is specifically mentioned on page 115. \n\nThe key sentence is: \"If you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object.\" That's the exact information needed. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other part of the context that contradicts or adds more details.

It says to wear protective clothing and gloves, read safety instructions from the supplier, and follow their directions. Also, if contact occurs, it mentions contacting a physician. \n\nBut the question is about what to do when there's no physician available. The context doesn't explicitly state first aid steps for someone who has fallen into fertilizer. However, there's a part on page 117 about contact with materials leading to injury and advising to contact a physician. Since there's no physician available, maybe the answer is to seek immediate medical help, but since that's not possible, perhaps the context doesn't provide specific first aid measures. \n\nWait, the context says \"Contact your physician in such an event!\" but if there's no physician available, maybe the answer is that the context doesn't provide specific instructions for that scenario.

Looking at page 118, there's a section about cleaning and storing the machine. It says, \"It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time. If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings.\" \n\nThen, on page 121 under \"Preparation for winter storage,\" it mentions, \"Lubricate and oil all points once again to ensure conservation.\" Also, page 124 talks about oil and grease content, specifying the quantities and types, but not directly about the consequences of not lubricating.\n\nWait, the question is about the consequence of never lubricating the grease nipples. The context doesn't explicitly state what happens if they are never lubricated. The advice given is to lubricate to prevent dirt, fertilizer, and water from entering bearings. However, the direct answer isn't stated as a negative consequence if they are never lubricated. The context emphasizes the benefits of lubricating, but doesn't mention the outcome of not doing so. \n\nSince the instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure, and there's no direct mention of the consequence of not lubricating, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, maybe there's another part.

It mentions that fertilizers and other salts significantly influence the rate of corrosion. It also says to empty the hopper at the end of activities and clean the machine after using such materials to prevent corrosion. \n\nNow, the question is about coastal vs. inland regions. Coastal areas typically have higher salt content in the air due to sea spray, which can accelerate corrosion. Inland areas might have less salt exposure. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention coastal or inland regions.

It just warns that leaving it on could drain the battery, but doesn't state the exact duration. \n\nI need to check if there's any mention of battery life or time. Let me go through the context again. \n\nLooking at page 32: \"The driving speed of your tractor (or your trailed machine) is transmitted via the ISOBUS to the IsoMatch.\" No mention of battery. \n\nPage 34 again: The warning is about the battery being flattened if the control box is left on, but no specific time. \n\nThe answer might be that the context doesn't specify a number of hours. The user is asking for a precise answer, but if the context doesn't provide a specific number, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nWait, the instruction says if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Since the context doesn't mention a specific duration, the answer should be that it's not found. \n\nBut let me check again. Maybe there's a part about battery life. Let me scan through all pages again. \n\nLooking through pages 30-34, the only mention related to battery is on page 34: \"the control box uses power, as a result of which the tractor battery could be flattened.\" No time frame given. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the context doesn't provide the exact number of hours.

The relevant sections are likely on pages 109 and 110, which mention driving patterns for different situations.\n\nLooking at page 109, under \"Driving pattern\" and \"Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A)\", there's a mention: \"Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge.\" This seems directly related to the question. \n\nAdditionally, on page 110, under \"Boundary track spreading with ExactLine\", it states: \"Drive half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters) (=first sprayer tramline) when doing boundary track spreading with the ExactLine.\" However, this refers to a different method (ExactLine) and uses 1/2 X meters, which might be a variable depending on the working width. The question is about the 'first path' for border spreading, which seems to align more with the 2 metres mentioned on page 109.\n\nI need to confirm if \"first path\" refers to the initial pass in situation A or B. The context mentions two situations: situation A (using ExactLine and additional room with the border spreading plate) and situation B (closing one disc and using a border spreading plate). The instruction for situation A says to drive the first path with the tractor's middle about 2 metres from the field edge. \n\nThe question doesn't specify whether it's situation A or B, but the general term 'border spreading' might refer to the method where you drive along the field edge. However, the exact answer is likely the 2 metres from page 109. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of distance tolerance. On page 109, under \"Working without sprayer tramlines (situation B)\", it also mentions driving the first path with the tractor's middle about 2 metres from the field edge. Wait, no, looking back, in situation B, the instruction says: \"Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge. Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.\" So both situations A and B mention 2 metres for the first path. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 2 metres. The context directly states this, so the answer should be 2 meters.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n2 metres",

First, I need to find the relevant information in the provided context.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about storing the machine, specifically on page 119. The text mentions placing the machine on a stable, level base. It also talks about using a ramp if needed. However, there's a part about the parking support: \"the machine or parking support must only be placed on a straight, firm surface.\" \n\nWait, the question is about a 10-degree slope. The context doesn't explicitly mention a 10-degree slope. It does say to avoid placing the machine on a slope, but the exact angle isn't specified. The instruction is to use a stable, level base. If the slope is 10 degrees, that's a bit steep. The context doesn't state whether it's safe or not. Since there's no direct mention of a 10-degree slope, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, there's a mention of using a ramp if the power lift can't be lowered enough. However, that's about the power lift, not the parking support. \n\nThe key part is: \"the machine or parking support must only be placed on a straight, firm surface.\" So, if the surface is not level, even a slope, it's not allowed. Therefore, the parking support isn't designed for slopes. The answer would be that it cannot withstand storage on a 10-degree slope because the instructions specify a level surface. But the context doesn't explicitly say that 10 degrees is unsafe. Wait, the user is asking if it can withstand storage on a 10-degree slope. The context says to place it on a stable, level base. If the slope is 10 degrees, that's not level. Therefore, the answer is no, but the context doesn't directly state that. Since the exact angle isn't mentioned, maybe the answer is \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't specify. However, the instruction says to place on a stable, level base, implying that slopes are not recommended. So the answer would be that it's not recommended, but the exact answer based on the context is that the parking support must be on a straight, firm surface, so a 10-degree slope isn't allowed. Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" but the context doesn't explicitly say that. Wait, the user's question is whether it can withstand storage on a 10-degree slope. The context says to place on a stable, level base. If the slope is 10 degrees, that's not level. Therefore, the answer is that it's not recommended, but the context doesn't explicitly state that. Since the instructions don't mention the angle, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, the instruction says to place on a stable, level base, which implies that slopes are not suitable. Therefore, the answer would be that the parking support cannot withstand storage on a slope of 10 degrees. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. So the correct answer based on the context is that the parking support must be placed on a straight, firm surface, so a 10-degree slope is not allowed. Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" but the context doesn't directly say that. Wait, the user's question is whether it can withstand storage on a 10-degree slope. The context says to place on a stable, level base. If the slope is 10 degrees, that's not level. Therefore, the answer is that it's not recommended, but the context doesn't explicitly state that. Since the exact answer isn't found, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, the instruction says to place on a stable, level base, which implies that slopes are not allowed. Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" but the context doesn't explicitly mention 10 degrees. So the answer is \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't specify the angle.

The user is asking what should be done at the start of the spring season to prepare the machine for work beyond cleaning and lubrication.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context is mostly about maintenance, storage, and operating procedures for a spreader machine. The question is specifically about spring preparation, so I should focus on sections related to starting the season or preparation steps.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section titled \"Preparation for winter storage\" on page 121. It mentions that at the end of the season, the machine must be prepared for winter storage. The steps include lubricating, cleaning, and lubricating again. However, the user is asking about the start of the spring season, not winter. But maybe the preparation steps for winter storage are similar to those needed at the start of the next season.\n\nAnother relevant part is on page 125 under \"Maintenance intervals,\" which lists various maintenance tasks. However, the question is about preparation beyond cleaning and lubrication. \n\nWait, there's a mention on page 121 about \"Provide white parts such as piston rods of hydraulic cylinders with preservative grease or inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with preserving liquid (supplied) for protection against corrosion.\" This is part of the winter storage preparation. But again, this is for the end of the season, not the start of spring.\n\nLooking further, on page 123, there's a section about \"Maintenance\" which includes checking and setting the dosing mechanism and discharge point settings. However, the exact answer might be in the \"Preparation for winter storage\" section. \n\nWait, the user is asking about the start of the spring season. The context mentions that at the end of the season, the machine should be prepared for winter storage. So, logically, at the start of the spring season, similar steps would be taken. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention spring preparation. \n\nBut the question says \"beyond cleaning and lubrication,\" so maybe there's a specific step mentioned. Let me check again. \n\nOn page 121, under \"Preparation for winter storage,\" it says: \"Provide white parts such as piston rods of hydraulic cylinders with preservative grease or inject the (white) metal parts of the machine with preserving liquid (supplied) for protection against corrosion.\" This is part of the preparation steps. However, this is for winter storage. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that after cleaning and lubrication, you should check and adjust the dosing mechanism and discharge point settings. Looking at page 125, under \"Maintenance intervals,\" there's a point 5: \"Checking and setting the dosing mechanism\" and point 6: \"Checking and setting the discharge point setting mechanism.\" These are part of the maintenance intervals. \n\nBut the question is about preparation at the start of the spring season. The context doesn't explicitly mention spring preparation steps, but the closest related information is the preparation for winter storage. However, the user is asking for steps beyond cleaning and lubrication. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is to check and adjust the dosing mechanism and discharge point settings as part of the preparation. Since the context mentions these steps under maintenance intervals, perhaps that's the answer. \n\nWait, the user's question is about preparing for work beyond cleaning and lubrication. The context on page 121 says that after cleaning, you should lubricate again, and also paint any damaged paintwork. But that's part of winter storage. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is to check the hydraulic system and ensure all components are in good condition. But I need to find the exact answer. \n\nLooking back, the user's question is about the start of the spring season. The context doesn't have a direct mention of spring preparation, but the closest is the preparation for winter storage. However, the user is asking for steps beyond cleaning and lubrication. \n\nWait, the answer might be that after cleaning and lubrication, you should check and adjust the dosing mechanism and discharge point settings. These are part of the maintenance intervals. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be to inspect and ensure all parts are in working order, but the exact answer needs to be from the context. \n\nLooking at page 125, under \"Maintenance intervals,\" point 5 and 6 mention checking and setting the dosing mechanism and discharge point setting mechanism. These are part of the maintenance steps. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to check and set the dosing mechanism and discharge point setting mechanism.

Looking at Page 126, there's a section titled \"Lubricating points\" which mentions that all lubricating nipples can be filled with a universal grease type. The text then refers to pages 124 and 125 for more details.\n\nOn Page 124, under \"Oil and grease content,\" there's a table.

The user is asking about the type of suitable lubricant recommended for connectors to prevent corrosion. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of lubricants related to connectors. The context is quite technical, so I'll need to scan through the sections carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section under \"Maintenance\" that mentions connectors. Specifically, on page 128, there's a part that says: \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding and becoming difficult to use.\" \n\nNow, the question is about the type of lubricant. The context doesn't explicitly state the name of the lubricant here. However, earlier in the document, on page 124, there's a table that lists lubricants. For example, under item 1, it says \"Lubricate with grease Lubricate with oil 1 to 2 times Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2 or equivalent MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90.\" \n\nBut wait, the question is specifically about connectors.

However, in the same context, when talking about lubricating points, it says to use a universal grease type. Also, in the section about the central gearbox, they mention EP00/000 gear grease. \n\nBut the exact answer might be in the part where they mention the connectors. Since the context doesn't specify a particular lubricant for connectors beyond saying to use a suitable one, but in the maintenance intervals, they mention using Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2, or equivalent. However, the question is about connectors, and the only direct mention is on page 128, which says to apply a suitable lubricant, but doesn't name it. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that the lubricant should be oil, as per the instruction to oil the connectors. But the context says \"apply a suitable lubricant\" which could be oil or grease. However, in the table on page 124, for lubricating with oil, they list Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2, etc. So perhaps the answer is that the suitable lubricant is oil, specifically those brands.

The user is asking about the typical lifespan of the agitator 'seal ring' in operational hours before it needs replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided context carefully. The context is a maintenance manual, so I should look for sections that mention the seal ring or related components. \n\nLooking at the pages, on page 134, there's a mention of the agitator axle and seal ring. The instruction says, \"The agitator axle must turn freely from the seal ring.\" But that's about function, not lifespan.\n\nMoving to page 140, which is about replacing the agitator axle seal. The text states: \"The agitator axle is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent fertiliser granule loss along the agitator axle. The seal must be replaced every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours.\" \n\nWait, the question is about the 'seal ring', but the context mentions a 'plastic seal' on the agitator axle. Is the seal ring the same as this plastic seal? The term 'seal ring' might be a different component, but in the context, the only mention related to replacement is the plastic seal on the agitator axle. \n\nThe user might be referring to the seal ring as part of the agitator axle's seal. Since the context doesn't explicitly mention a 'seal ring' lifespan, but does mention the plastic seal needing replacement every season and after 100 hours, perhaps the answer is based on that. However, the question specifically asks about the 'seal ring', which isn't directly mentioned. \n\nBut maybe in the context, the seal ring is the same as the plastic seal. If that's the case, then the answer would be every season and after 100 operational hours. However, the user might be looking for the operational hours part. The context says \"every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours.\" So the seal (possibly the seal ring) needs replacement every 100 hours. \n\nBut the question is about the 'seal ring' specifically. If the context doesn't mention the seal ring's lifespan, but the plastic seal's, then the answer might be that it's not found. However, the user might consider the seal ring as the same as the plastic seal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the seal ring is part of the dosing mechanism. Looking back, on page 134, there's a mention of the seal ring. The instruction says to check the distance between the agitator axle and the seal ring. But there's no mention of replacement intervals for the seal ring itself. \n\nSo, the only mention of a seal requiring replacement is the plastic seal on the agitator axle, which is replaced every season and after 100 hours. Since the question is about the 'seal ring', and the context doesn't specify its lifespan, but the plastic seal's, perhaps the answer is that the seal (which might be the seal ring) needs replacement every 100 operational hours. \n\nBut the user might be conflating terms. Since the context doesn't explicitly state the seal ring's lifespan, but the plastic seal's, the answer might be that the seal (assuming seal ring) should be replaced every 100 operational hours. However, the exact term 'seal ring' isn't used in the context for replacement intervals. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the context is that the plastic seal on the agitator axle must be replaced every season and after 100 operational hours. But since the question is about the 'seal ring', which isn't directly mentioned, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". However, if the seal ring refers to the plastic seal, then the answer is 100 operational hours. \n\nBut the context says \"every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours.\" So the answer would be that the seal (assuming seal ring) should be replaced every 100 operational hours. However, the exact term 'seal ring' isn't used. Therefore, the answer might be that the lifespan is not specified for the seal ring, but the plastic seal is replaced every 100 hours. \n\nBut the user's question is about the 'seal ring', which isn't directly addressed. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context\" or \"Unknown\". However, if the seal ring is the same as the plastic seal, then the answer is 100 operational hours. \n\nGiven that the context mentions the plastic seal on the agitator axle needing replacement after 100 hours, and the question is about the 'seal ring', which might be the same component, the answer would be 100 operational hours. But since the term 'seal",

Or perhaps there's another part. Let me check other pages. \n\nOn page 136, there's a mention of the distance between the inside of the rope and the discharge bushing being 109 mm. But that's different from the crack between the baffles. \n\nWait, maybe the 'small crack of light' is referring to the 1.0 mm distance mentioned in page 138 regarding the discharge bushing and spreading disc. But that's a different measurement. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is not directly stated. The context mentions the small crack of light when the dosing openings are closed, but doesn't specify the exact dimension. However, the user is asking for the dimension. If the context doesn't provide a specific number, then the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nBut wait, let me check again.
