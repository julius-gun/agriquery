The context is a manual for a machine, probably agricultural, discussing safety, usage, technical specs, and setup procedures. The relevant section is likely around the part where they talk about connecting the IsoMatch control box to the tractor, especially when the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS.\n\nLooking through the context, on Page 32, there's a section about adapting non-ISO tractors with the IsoMatch power cable set. It mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you can add it using the IsoMatch power cable set. Then, the driving speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So the answer would involve using the IsoMatch power cable set to enable ISOBUS communication. The exact sentence might be: \"The driving speed of your tractor (or your trailed machine) is transmitted via the ISOBUS to the IsoMatch.\" But that's when the tractor has ISOBUS. Wait, no, the context says that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you add it with the IsoMatch power cable set, making it ISOBUS ready.

Also, there's a note about a sensor being available as an optional extra to read the ExactLine and hydraulic border spreading plate positions, connected to the machine electronics.\n\nPage 48 talks about the calibration container and some setup steps, but not directly about the sensor connection. \n\nSo, the key point is that the position sensor must be connected to the electronic box on the spreader. The exact answer should be that the sensor is connected to the electronic box on the spreader. I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Let me check again. \n\nYes, page 47 clearly states: \"Connect the position sensor in the electronic box on the spreader.\" That's the direct answer.

It mentions that the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. The key sentence there says: \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo, the middle trough (which is the one in the middle of the track) has a quantity that's 10% of the middle trough's quantity.

Let me parse it again.\n\nThe sentence says: \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo, the first trough (which is in the ditch) should be 10% of the middle trough's quantity.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the middle trough is the one in the middle of the track. The first trough in the ditch is the one next to the fictive ditch. The statement says that the quantity in the first trough (ditch) must be a maximum of 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So, the loss in the ditch (the first trough) is 10% of the middle trough. Therefore, the maximum allowed loss is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. But the question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" Wait, maybe the question is asking for the maximum percentage loss relative to the middle trough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle trough's quantity is considered as 100%, and the first trough (ditch) can't exceed 10% of that. Therefore, the maximum allowed loss in the ditch (the first trough) is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the answer would be 10%.\n\nLooking back at the context, on page 87, the exact sentence is: \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo the first trough (ditch) is 10% of the middle trough.

The user is asking for the hopper weight without the hopper cover for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 model. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant section in the provided context. The context has several pages, and the technical specifications are mentioned on page 36. Let me check that section.\n\nLooking at page 36, there's a table under \"Technical specifications\" for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD with different models: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. The columns are 0 to 13. \n\nThe user is asking about the \"hopper weight without hopper cover,\" which corresponds to row 10 in the table. Let me scan through the entries. \n\nRow 10 says: \"Without hopper cover (kg)\" with values 277,5 for 1875, 307,5 for 2550, 337,5 for 3225, and 367,5 for 3900. \n\nSo the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 has a hopper weight without cover of 337.5 kg. \n\nI need to confirm there's no other mention of hopper weight elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, I don't see any other references to hopper weight for this model. The answer should be 337.5 kg. \n\nThe user might be looking for this value for setup or operational purposes, ensuring they know the weight for transportation or handling. The answer is precise and directly from the table, so it's safe to provide that.\n</think>\n\n337.5",

Scanning through the pages, I see on Page 36 under Technical specifications. There's a table with different models: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. \n\nLooking at the rows, the fifth row (row 5) under the 3900 model mentions \"Weight (kg)\" and the value is 795.

The context is a manual for a machine, likely agricultural, discussing various technical specifications and safety instructions. \n\nLooking through the pages, I remember that on page 37, there's a section about technical specifications, including sound levels. Let me check that. \n\nOn page 37, under the \"Technical specifications\" section, there's a table. The rows 2 to 5 mention different sound levels. Specifically, row 2 says \"Tractor at 540 rpm (dB)\" with values 71.9 and 76.2. Then row 3 is \"Tractor + operating, empty spreader (dB)\" with 71.9 and 82.3. Row 4 is \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) (dB)\" with 73.8 and 84.6. Row 5 is \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB)\" with 73.0 and 87.2. \n\nThe question is about the sound level when the rear window is opened. Looking at the headers, the first column seems to be the condition, and the second column is the sound level. The first entry under row 2 is \"Closed cabin\" and the second is \"Rear window opened\". So for the Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60), the value when the rear window is opened is 84.6 dB. \n\nI need to confirm that this is the correct entry. The user specified \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60)\" which matches row 4. The rear window opened corresponds to the second value in that row, which is 84.6 dB. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 84.6 dB.\n</think>\n\n84.6 dB",

The context provided is a manual for maintaining a spreader machine.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant sections. The question is about the interval for checking bushing height and setting discharge. Looking through the context, pages 136 and 138 mention the discharge bushing height. \n\nOn page 138, there's a section titled \"Checking and setting the discharge bushing height.\" The text says, \"The distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be 1.0 mm.\" Then, under the instructions, it mentions measuring the distance and adjusting if necessary. However, the specific interval isn't stated here.\n\nLooking further, in the maintenance intervals on page 125, there's a table. The entry for \"Checking and setting the discharge bushing height\" is listed under \"Page 138.\" The maintenance intervals table on page 125 lists various tasks with their intervals. For example, some tasks are daily, after the first 10 hours, weekly, every 100 hours, etc. \n\nBut the exact interval for checking the bushing height isn't explicitly mentioned in the context. The manual might imply that it's part of regular maintenance checks, but the user is asking for the specific interval. Since the context doesn't provide a clear interval for this particular task, the answer might be that it's part of routine checks as per the maintenance schedule. However, the user might expect an answer based on the maintenance intervals listed. \n\nWait, looking back at page 125, the maintenance intervals table includes \"Checking and setting the discharge bushing height\" under the \"Page 138\" entry. The intervals listed there are \"min. 1 x per year\" and \"As recommended.\" But the exact interval isn't specified beyond that. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify a particular interval beyond the general maintenance checks, the answer would be that it's checked and set as part of the regular maintenance intervals, which are outlined in the maintenance schedule. However, the user might need a more precise answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that it's checked during the maintenance intervals specified in the manual, which include regular checks as per the maintenance schedule. But since the exact interval isn't given, the answer might be \"as recommended\" or \"during regular maintenance checks.\" However, the user wants the exact information from the context. \n\nWait, in the maintenance intervals on page 125, the entry for \"Checking and setting the discharge bushing height\" is listed under \"Page 138\" and the intervals are \"min. 1 x per year\" and \"As recommended.\" So the answer would be that it must be checked and set at least once per year, as per the maintenance intervals. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer based on the context is that the bushing height must be checked and the discharge set at least once per year.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nAt least once per year.",

The question is about a blocked fertilizer flow, so I should search for sections mentioning blocked flow or related issues.\n\nLooking at page 140, there's a section about replacing the agitator axle seal. It mentions that if the seal is not replaced, it could lead to fertilizer granule loss. But that's more about seal maintenance than blocked flow.\n\nMoving to page 141, there's a part about replacing the seal rings and checking the agitator axle. It also mentions that if the agitator is worn out, you should replace it. However, the direct mention of blocked flow is not here.\n\nOn page 152, there's a troubleshooting table. Problem 6 states: \"Incorrect application rates (kg per hectare) - The flow of the fertiliser is blocked. Solution: Clean the machine well after each use. Replace the agitator if it is worn out.

This setup is meant to provide accurate, reliable flow at low rates. \n\nHowever, the context doesn't mention anything about the cost of fine application versus normal dosing. The information provided focuses on the technical aspects, like how the dosing works, the settings, and the effects on spreading patterns. There's no discussion of expenses, pricing, or cost-related factors related to these application methods. \n\nSince the question is about cost and the context doesn't address costs at all, the answer should be that the information isn't found in the context.

First, I need to find the relevant information in the provided context.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about boundary track spreading with ExactLine on page 29. It mentions that ExactLine allows spreading right up to the border from the first sprayer tramline. However, it also states that current environmental standards only allow minimal loss over the field edge. \n\nThen, on page 30, there's a part about the GEOSPREAD function influencing the spreading pattern. It mentions one-sided boundary spreading with a border spreading plate and notes that adjusting the border spreading plate helps overcome environmental pollution. But there's no explicit mention of small gardens here.\n\nAnother part on page 28 talks about reducing working width during the pass, which allows variable working width at an angle on headlands (gored spreading). However, this seems more about adjusting for different field conditions rather than small gardens.\n\nThe key point is that the context discusses one-sided boundary spreading as a method to minimize fertilizer loss over the field edge, which is relevant for environmental standards. However, there's no direct mention of small gardens. The term \"small gardens\" isn't used anywhere in the context. The discussions are about agricultural fields and environmental impact, not residential gardens. \n\nSince the context doesn't address small gardens specifically, the answer should be that it's not mentioned. The user might be conflating agricultural practices with garden use, but based on the given text, there's no information about suitability for small gardens. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

On page 33, it's described as a universal ISOBUS terminal with various functions. The text mentions that it can operate multiple programs simultaneously, has a touch screen, and can check the machine's status, tractor data, field data, etc. However, there's no mention of weather checking. \n\nOn page 41, there's a section about the GPS signal for GEOCONTROL, which might relate to location, but not weather.

The user is asking about the maximum height the fertilizer flies when spreading without using the GEOCONTROL headland. \n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant part of the context. The question is specifically about the height of fertilizer during spreading without GEOCONTROL. Let me scan through the provided context.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section on page 100 under \"Use in the field\" that mentions: \"TIP Set the overlap on the field boundary to 0 if you do not wish to spread over the field boundary.\" But that's about overlap, not height. \n\nAnother part on page 106 under \"Border spreading\" says: \"The spreader has 2 different functions and accessories to cater for border spreading.\" Still not about height. \n\nWait, there's a mention on page 95 under \"Spreading height\": \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" This seems related to the height setting of the spreader. \n\nBut the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies, not the setting. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at page 105: \"The spreading pattern of both spreading discs overlap partially, especially in the middle behind the spreader.\" Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the section about ExactLine on page 110. It mentions: \"The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 10,000%).\" Wait, that seems like a typo. Maybe it's 10% of the center quantity. But that's about loss, not height. \n\nWait, maybe the height is related to the spreading disc height. On page 95, it says: \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" So the spreading discs are set 75 cm above the ground. But does that mean the fertilizer is spread at that height? \n\nBut the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. If the discs are 75 cm above the ground, then the fertilizer would be spread at that height. However, the context might have a specific value. \n\nWait, looking at page 100 again: \"The driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed!\" Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the section about the ExactLine on page 110. It says: \"The (online) spreading charts indicate the correct setting for the ExactLine and the relevant rpm for the PTO shaft and the spreading discs.\" But that's about settings, not height. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the section about the hydraulic border spreading plate on page 107. It mentions: \"The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%). Test if the border spreading plate (optional extra) door de test therefore always before hand as described in...\" Still about loss, not height. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is not directly stated. The user might be referring to the height setting of the spreader. On page 95, it says the distance from the bottom of the vanes to the ground or crop is 75 cm. So the fertilizer is spread at 75 cm height. But the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. If the spreader is set to 75 cm, then that's the height. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mention of the height in the context of ExactLine. On page 110, it says: \"Set the ExactLine to the environment setting as per the details given in the spreading chart for the desired working width.\" But no specific height. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 75 cm. Since the context mentions that the spreading discs are set to 75 cm above the ground or crops. So when spreading without GEOCONTROL, the fertilizer is spread at 75 cm height. Therefore, the maximum height is 75 cm. \n\nBut I need to confirm. The question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. If the spreader is set to 75 cm, then that's the height. So the answer is 75 cm.

I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for sections related to stopping work or road transport. Looking at the pages, Page 112 mentions \"Stopping work\" and lists several steps. Let me check that section.\n\nOn Page 112, under \"Stopping work,\" the steps include closing the dosing units, switching off the PTO shaft, turning off the electronic control system, switching off the tractor, removing the keys, engaging the parking brake, removing crop remains, fixing the hopper cover, and taking measures for road transport. The last point refers to \"Preparing the machine to be transported\" on page 93.\n\nSo the direct answer should include the steps mentioned here. The user wants precise measures, so I need to list each step as per the context. However, the question specifically asks for measures for road transport. The context mentions \"Take all appropriate measures for road transport\" as part of the stopping work procedure. \n\nBut looking at the exact text, the answer should include the steps listed under stopping work, especially the part about road transport. The answer should be concise, so I'll extract the relevant points: closing dosing units, turning off systems, parking brake, removing debris, securing hopper, and taking road transport measures. However, the exact answer from the context is \"Take all appropriate measures for road transport.\" But the user wants the exact answer from the context. Let me check again.\n\nIn the context, under \"Stopping work\" on Page 112, the last bullet says: \"Take all appropriate measures for road transport.\" So the answer should be that specific instruction. However, the user might expect more details. Wait, the answer needs to be precise and based on the context. The exact answer is \"Take all appropriate measures for road transport.\" But maybe there's more. Let me check if there's another mention. \n\nLooking at Page 116, there's a mention of \"Take all appropriate measures for road transport\" again. So the answer is that exact phrase.

Looking at page 126, there's a section about lubricating points. It says that all lubricating nipples can be filled with universal grease. Then, on page 127, under \"Applying or adding grease,\" there's a part about the coupling shaft profiled tubes needing regular greasing. If the halves of the coupling shaft don't slide smoothly during coupling or decoupling, you should grease the contact surfaces. \n\nBut the question is about never lubricating the grease nipples. The context doesn't explicitly state the consequences of never lubricating them. However, there's a mention on page 124 about never using more oil or grease than prescribed, but that's about over-lubrication, not lack thereof. \n\nWait, maybe there's an implication. If the grease nipples aren't lubricated, the machine parts that rely on them might not function properly. For example, the coupling shaft's profiled tubes need regular greasing.

The user is asking how the corrosion rate on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD compares between coastal and inland agricultural regions. \n\nFirst, I need to find information in the provided context that relates to corrosion and the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. Let me scan through the context.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section under \"Maintenance\" on page 21 that mentions: \"Fertiliser and other salts have a great influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper at the end of activities. Protect the machine by always cleaning it after using such material and patch breaks in the paint. Corrosion affects the strength of the construction and the operation of the machine, which could lead to a shortened lifespan.\"\n\nSo, the context states that fertilizers and other salts influence corrosion rates. Now, the question is about coastal vs. inland regions. Coastal areas typically have higher salt content in the air due to sea spray, while inland areas might have less salt. \n\nThe Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD is used for spreading fertilizers, which are salts. If the machine is used in coastal areas, the exposure to salt (from both fertilizers and the environment) would likely increase corrosion. Inland areas, with less salt in the air and possibly different fertilizers, might have lower corrosion rates. \n\nHowever, the context doesn't explicitly mention coastal vs. inland regions. It only talks about the effect of fertilizers and salts on corrosion. So, the answer must be inferred based on the given information. The context doesn't provide direct data comparing coastal and inland, but it does indicate that the presence of salts (from fertilizers) increases corrosion. Therefore, machines used in coastal areas (with more salt exposure) would experience higher corrosion rates compared to inland areas where such salts are less prevalent.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD specifically. The context doesn't mention any specific data on corrosion rates between different regions for this model. The only info is that fertilizers and salts affect corrosion. So, the answer should be based on that. Since the context doesn't compare coastal and inland, but the user is asking for a comparison, maybe the answer is that the corrosion rate is higher in coastal areas due to increased salt exposure, but the context doesn't explicitly state this. However, the user might expect that since the context mentions salts influence corrosion, and coastal areas have more salt, the answer is that the rate is higher in coastal regions. But the context doesn't directly say that. So, the correct answer based on the context is that the corrosion rate is influenced by the presence of salts from fertilizers, but there's no direct comparison between coastal and inland regions. However, the user might infer that coastal areas have more salt, leading to higher corrosion. But since the context doesn't mention coastal vs inland, the answer should be based on the given info. The answer should state that the corrosion rate is influenced by the presence of salts from fertilizers, but there's no direct comparison provided in the context. However, the user's question might expect an answer based on the assumption that coastal areas have more salt. But according to the instructions, if the context doesn't have the info, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". Wait, the context does mention that fertilizers and other salts influence corrosion. So, if the machine is used in coastal areas where there's more salt in the air, the corrosion rate would be higher. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. Therefore, the answer should be that the corrosion rate is influenced by the presence of salts from fertilizers, but there's no direct comparison between coastal and inland regions in the context. However, the user's question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD, and the context doesn't mention any specific data on that.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how many hours the IsoMatch Tellus can operate continuously before flattening a typical tractor battery if left switched on with the engine off.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any information related to battery drain or operation time when the engine is off. The context is mostly about safety procedures, maintenance, technical specs, and setup instructions for the machine and control systems. \n\nI'll start by skimming through the sections. On page 34, there's a mention about switching off the control box when leaving the tractor. It says, \"Always switch off the control box when you leave the tractor. If the box is engaged, unintended functions can be activated while you are in the danger area. Moreover, the control box uses power, as a result of which the tractor battery could be flattened.\" \n\nBut this doesn't specify the exact number of hours. I need to check if there's any mention of battery drain rates or operational time. Looking through other pages, there's a section on page 31 about automatic calibration and battery content, but it's about the hopper weight, not the battery. \n\nAnother part on page 34 mentions that if the hopper content becomes less than 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. However, this is about the hopper, not the battery. \n\nI don't see any specific information about how long the IsoMatch Tellus can run on a battery when the engine is off. The context warns about the battery being flattened if the control box is left on, but it doesn't provide a time frame. \n\nSince the question asks for a precise answer and the context doesn't mention a specific number of hours, the correct response would be that the information isn't found in the context. The user might need to refer to the manufacturer's specifications or battery capacity details, which aren't provided here.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The context is a manual for setting up and using a machine, probably agricultural. The question is about grease for profiled tubes in the coupling shaft.\n\nLooking through the pages, I remember that on page 51, there's a section about shortening the coupling shaft. Let me check that. \n\nOn page 51, under \"Shortening the coupling shaft,\" there's a step that says: \"Apply grease to the profiled tubes.\" But wait, the context doesn't mention a specific type of grease here. It just says to apply grease. \n\nWait, maybe another section. Let me scan through other pages. On page 50, under \"Mounting the coupling shaft,\" there's a mention of checking the coupling shaft length. Still no specific grease type. \n\nLooking at page 52, \"Connecting to the tractor\" section. There's a part about checking the coupling shaft, but again, no grease type specified. \n\nWait, maybe in the section about the coupling shaft's profiled tubes. Let me check page 51 again. The exact text is: \"Apply grease to the profiled tubes.\" But the context doesn't specify the type of grease. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mention elsewhere. Let me check page 43, which talks about vanes and greasing threaded rods. But that's for vanes, not the profiled tubes. \n\nHmm. The user is asking for a specific type of grease, but the context only mentions applying grease without specifying the type. Therefore, the answer might be that the context doesn't specify the type, so the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nWait, but the user's instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. Since the context doesn't mention a specific grease type, the answer should be that it's not found. \n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a part.

However, the question specifically mentions 'baud rate,' which might be a bit confusing since RS-232 typically uses a specific set of parameters, including baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity. But the user is asking for the minimum baud rate, so I need to check the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, I remember there was a section about the RS 232 connection. Let me scan through the pages again. \n\nAh, here's the relevant part: On Page 72, under the section \"Variable, externally driven application rate,\" there's a mention of the RS 232 connection. The text says, \"The external system and the control system of a spreader with an IsoMatch control box communicate through a serial port with an RS 232 connection.

However, the context doesn't explicitly state the baud rate. The text mentions the RS 232 connection and refers to the user manual for the IsoMatch control box for the settings, including the occupation of pins and settings required. But there's no specific number given for the baud rate here. \n\nThe user is asking for the minimum baud rate, but the context doesn't provide that information. The context only mentions that the RS 232 connection is used and that the settings (including baud rate) are in the user manual.

The context is quite lengthy, so I'll look for keywords like \"driving speed,\" \"border spreading,\" and \"application rate.\"\n\nLooking through the pages, on page 107, there's a mention of border spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate. It says, \"The maximum acceptable loss over the field edge is determined by environment standards. In order to comply with the standard the quantity of fertiliser spread beyond the field edge must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity distributed in the centre behind the spreader (= 100%).\"\n\nWait, that's about the loss percentage, not directly the speed reduction. Let me check other sections. \n\nOn page 109, under \"Driving pattern,\" there's a part that says: \"Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.\" But that's about PTO shaft speed, not driving speed. \n\nLooking at page 100, under \"Start spreading,\" it mentions: \"The rpm of the tractor engine (therefore also of the PTO shaft) must remain constant while spreading (with regards to distributing fertiliser along the width). The driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed!\" \n\nHmm, so the driving speed is adjusted by selecting another speed, but there's no specific percentage mentioned here. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is related to the 10% loss mentioned earlier. The question is about compensating for application rate. If the loss is 10%, maybe the speed reduction is related to that. But the context doesn't explicitly state a percentage for speed reduction. \n\nAlternatively, looking at page 107 again, the test for the border spreading plate is mentioned, but no speed percentage. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the part about the ExactLine settings. On page 110, it says: \"In the yield setting (YIELD), the loss over the field edge is higher than what is allowed by the environmental standard. Therefore, never use this setting next to surface water. Cover to the border is very good with this option.\" But again, not about speed. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the part about the PTO shaft rpm. On page 100, it says: \"The rpm of the tractor engine (therefore also of the PTO shaft) must remain constant while spreading (with regards to distributing fertiliser along the width).\" So the speed reduction might be related to maintaining PTO rpm. But the question is about driving speed reduction percentage. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 75% as mentioned on page 109. Let me check again. On page 109, under \"Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A):\" it says, \"Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.\" But that's PTO rpm, not driving speed. \n\nWait, the question is about driving speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't explicitly mention a percentage for driving speed during border spreading. However, there's a mention of \"the driving speed can only be adjusted by selecting another speed!\" on page 100. But no specific percentage. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 10% as per the maximum acceptable loss. But the question is about speed reduction to compensate for application rate. The context doesn't directly link the 10% loss to a speed reduction percentage. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 75% as per the PTO rpm reduction. But the question is about driving speed, not PTO rpm. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is not directly stated. The user might be referring to the 10% loss, but the question is about speed reduction. Since the context doesn't mention a specific percentage for driving speed reduction during border spreading, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nWait, but the user's question is about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage to compensate for application rate. The context mentions that the application rate can be affected by the spreading pattern and overlap. However, there's no direct mention of a percentage for speed reduction. \n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, there's no specific percentage given for driving speed reduction during border spreading. The answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The user is asking about the distance tolerance in meters from the field edge when driving the 'first path' for border spreading. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The context is a manual for operating a spreading machine, covering various aspects like setup, safety procedures, and specific techniques for border spreading. \n\nLooking through the pages, I remember there were sections about border spreading methods, particularly using the hydraulic border spreading plate and ExactLine. The question is about the 'first path' distance from the field edge. \n\nI'll start by searching for keywords like \"first path,\" \"field edge,\" \"distance,\" or \"tolerance.\" Let me scan through the relevant sections. \n\nOn page 109, under \"Driving pattern,\" there's a section about working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A). It mentions: \"Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge.\" That seems directly relevant. \n\nAnother mention is on page 110 regarding ExactLine, but that's about setting the ExactLine position, not the distance. \n\nAlso, on page 109, under working without sprayer tramlines (situation B), it says: \"Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge.\" So both situations A and B mention 2 meters. \n\nThe question is about the distance tolerance, which in this context seems to be exactly 2 meters. The term \"tolerance\" might be a bit ambiguous, but given the manual's instructions, it's specifying the exact distance. \n\nI need to confirm there's no other mention of a different distance. Scanning through other pages, I don't see any other numbers related to this specific question. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2 meters. The manual explicitly states that the first path should be driven with the tractor's middle about 2 metres from the field edge. This is the precise information needed.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n2 metres",

Looking at the pages, I see that Page 119 talks about disconnecting the machine and mentions parking support. Specifically, there's a part that says: \"the machine or parking support must only be placed on a straight, firm surface.\" \n\nWait, that's a key point. The context explicitly states that the parking support should be on a straight, firm surface. There's no mention of slopes or angles. The question is about a 10-degree slope.

Looking through the pages, I see on page 118 under \"Storing the machine\" there's a mention of preparing for winter storage, which includes lubricating, cleaning, and lubricating again. But the user is asking about the start of the spring season, so maybe the same steps apply but in reverse? Wait, the context also mentions on page 121 under \"Preparation for winter storage\" that before storing for winter, you should lubricate, clean, and lubricate again. However, the question is about the start of the spring season, which would be the opposite of winter storage. \n\nWait, maybe there's a section that talks about starting the season. Let me check again. On page 118, there's a note about preparing for winter storage, which includes cleaning and lubrication. But the user is asking about spring, so perhaps the same steps are done at the start of the season. However, the exact answer might be in another part. \n\nLooking at page 121, under \"Preparation for winter storage,\" it says: \"It is advisable to first lubricate, clean and again lubricate the machine before storing it for a short or longer period of time.\" But the user is asking about the start of the spring season, which would be similar to preparing for the season, not winter storage. However, maybe the answer is that you should check and adjust the dosing mechanism. \n\nWait, looking at page 133, there's a section about checking and setting the dosing mechanism, which should be done after the first 10 running hours, each season, etc. So maybe part of preparing for the season is checking and setting the dosing mechanism. \n\nAlternatively, on page 121, under \"Preparation for winter storage,\" it mentions that after cleaning, you should lubricate and oil all points again. But the user is asking about spring, so perhaps the same steps apply. However, the question says \"beyond cleaning and lubrication,\" so maybe there's another step. \n\nWait, the user is asking for what should be done beyond cleaning and lubrication.

But I need to look for any mention of the lifespan or replacement intervals for vanes.\n\nLooking through the pages, on page 135, there's a mention of the dosing plates and their correct positioning. However, the key part might be in the maintenance intervals.

The context is a technical manual for a machine, probably agricultural, discussing maintenance, lubrication, and parts replacement. The question is specifically about lubricants for connectors to prevent corrosion.\n\nLooking through the pages, I remember that on page 128, there's a section about connectors. Let me check that. \n\nOn page 128, under the section \"Connectors\", it says: \"The following parts only function well if they are provided with sufficient oil. Check this regularly. The connectors between the central gearbox and the spreading disc gearboxes are used with border spreading and when checking the spreading pattern with the tray test. Disconnect one of the connectors from the spreading discs. Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors.

However, the context doesn't explicitly mention the type of lubricant. It just says \"suitable lubricant\". Wait, but maybe there's more. Let me check other sections for any mention of lubricants.\n\nLooking at page 124, there's a table under \"Oil and grease content\" which lists lubricants. For example, it mentions Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2, or equivalent MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90. But is that for connectors specifically? The context on page 128 refers to connectors but doesn't specify the type. However, the answer might be inferred from the general lubricants mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWait, the question is about connectors and preventing corrosion. The context on page 128 says to oil the connectors to prevent corrosion. The lubricants mentioned in the table on page 124 are for lubricating points, including grease nipples. However, the exact lubricant for connectors isn't specified in the context. The answer might be that the suitable lubricant is a general oil, but the context doesn't specify a particular type. \n\nBut the user's question is about what type of lubricant is recommended. Since the context doesn't specify a particular type beyond \"suitable lubricant\", but in the maintenance section, the lubricants mentioned are Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2, or equivalent MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90. These are for lubricating points, which might include connectors. However, the exact answer might be that the suitable lubricant is a general oil, but the context doesn't specify. \n\nWait, the answer needs to be based strictly on the context. If the context doesn't mention a specific type, then the answer would be that the suitable lubricant is not specified, but the instruction is to use a suitable lubricant. However, the user might expect the answer to be the ones mentioned in the table. Let me check again.\n\nIn the table on page 124, under item 1, it says: \"Lubricate with grease Lubricate with oil 1 to 2 times Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2 or equivalent MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90\". This might refer to lubricating points, which could include connectors. However, the exact mention for connectors is on page 128, which says to apply a suitable lubricant. Since the context doesn't specify a particular type for connectors, but the general lubricants mentioned are Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2, or equivalent MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90, perhaps those are the recommended types. \n\nBut the question is about connectors specifically.

However, in the context, there's also mention of a 'seal ring' in other sections. For example, on page 141, there's a part about replacing the fertiliser sealing ring. But the specific lifespan for the seal ring isn't directly stated there. \n\nBut the main information about replacement intervals is on page 140, which talks about the seal (not explicitly seal ring) needing replacement every season and after 100 operational hours. Since the question is about the 'seal ring', and the context mentions the seal being replaced every season and after 100 hours, it's possible that the seal ring's lifespan is tied to these intervals. \n\nHowever, the exact term 'seal ring' might refer to a different component. Let me check again. On page 141, there's a mention of \"fertiliser sealing ring\" which is replaced along with the metal seal rings. But the lifespan for that isn't specified. \n\nWait, the original answer from the context about the agitator axle seal being replaced every season and after 100 hours might be the closest relevant info. Since the question is about the 'seal ring', and the context refers to the seal on the agitator axle, perhaps the answer is that the seal (ring) should be replaced every season and after 100 operational hours. \n\nBut the user is asking for the typical lifespan in operational hours. The context says \"every season\" and \"after every 100 operational hours\". So combining these, the seal ring should be replaced every 100 hours or at the end of each season, whichever comes first. However, the exact operational hour lifespan is 100 hours. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the agitator seal ring should be replaced every 100 operational hours.\n</think>\n\nThe agitator seal ring must be replaced every season and after every 100 operational hours.  \n**Answer:** 100 operational hours.",

Because on Page 138, there's a mention of the distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc being 1.0 mm. But that's a different part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'small crack of light' is referring to the 1.0 mm gap? But that seems unrelated. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 1.0 mm. Let me check again. The user is asking about the 'small crack of light' between dosing baffles. The context mentions that when the dosing plates are correctly positioned, you see a small crack. However, the exact dimension isn't given. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 1.0 mm because that's the standard for similar measurements in the context. But I need to be precise. Since the context doesn't explicitly state the dimension, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nBut wait, looking back, on Page 135, the user is told to check if a small crack is visible.

However, maybe the context specifies a particular type of metal? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the context again, I don't see any mention of the specific metal type. The term \"metal seal rings\" is used, which implies that the material is metal. However, sometimes in technical documents, they might specify the exact material, like stainless steel.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the context, there's a mention of \"stainless steel tightening torques\" on pages 129 and 130, but that's about bolts and nuts. The seal rings are mentioned as metal, but the exact material isn't specified. However, the question is about the material of the 'metal seal rings', so the answer is metal. But maybe the answer is stainless steel because in some contexts, metal seal rings might be made of stainless steel. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that. \n\nWait, looking at page 141 again: \"Replace the fertiliser sealing ring.\" The previous seal was plastic, and the new ones are metal. Since the question is about the material of the 'metal seal rings', the answer is metal. However, the user might be expecting a specific type. But the context doesn't mention any specific metal. Therefore, the answer is metal. But wait, the question says \"metal seal rings\" so the material is metal. However, maybe the answer is stainless steel because in some parts of the context, like the tightening torques, stainless steel is mentioned. But that's for bolts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the metal seal rings are made of stainless steel. Wait, but the context doesn't explicitly say that. The only mention is that they are metal. Therefore, the answer should be metal. However, the user might have a different expectation. Let me check again. \n\nIn the context, the term \"metal seal rings\" is used, which implies the material is metal. Since there's no further specification, the answer is metal.
