The user is asking how the tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information. The context mentions different scenarios for connecting IsoMatch Tellus to a tractor. There's a section about tractors without ISOBUS. Let me check that part again.\n\nUnder \"Terminal IsoMatch Tellus sur un tracteur non ISOBUS,\" it says that for a non-ISOBUS tractor, you connect the cable's end with one connector to the CAN port. Then, the other end with two connectors to the command box. Wait, but the question is about transmitting driving speed, not just connecting the device. \n\nLooking further, there's a mention of \"Signal GPS pour le GEOCONTROL\" which might relate to GPS signals, but the question is about speed transmission. The context also talks about using a cable with a specific connector for ISOBUS tractors, but the user's tractor lacks ISOBUS. \n\nWait, there's a part that says if the tractor has a complete ISOBUS connection, a 9-broche cable is sufficient. But for non-ISOBUS, the standard wiring harness is used. However, the question is about transmitting speed without ISOBUS. The context doesn't explicitly mention how speed is transmitted in non-ISOBUS cases. It only describes the wiring steps. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify a method for transmitting speed data when ISOBUS isn't present, the answer might be that it's not covered here.

Additionally, they check if there's enough space behind the mounting spot for drilling and assembly.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should state that if no existing location is suitable, the user must create a base (socle) and insert the tube. The exact answer from the context is: \"vous devez vous-même réaliser un socle dans lequel insérer le tube.\" But the answer needs to be in English and precise. The user might also need to solder the base, but the main action here is creating the base and inserting the tube. \n\nWait, the exact instruction says \"réaliser un socle dans lequel insérer le tube\" which translates to \"create a base in which to insert the tube.\" So the answer should mention creating a base and inserting the tube. Also, the context mentions soldering the socle, but the question is about mounting the foot, which is the tube. So the main steps are creating the base and inserting the tube.

The user is asking about a specific precaution to take before working between the tractor and machine to check the coupling shaft length. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of checking the coupling shaft length or related precautions. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse that carefully.\n\nLooking through the context, there are several safety instructions. The first part talks about rotating parts not stopping immediately and not approaching the machine until all moving parts have stopped. Then there's a mention of not staying under an unsecured lifted machine. The next part discusses the machine possibly lowering suddenly due to hydraulic pressure loss and needing to rest on sturdy supports when working underneath. \n\nFurther down, there's a section about checking the tractor and machine's condition before use, including lighting, safety devices, and braking. Then there's a part about not leaving the machine on the ground during filling, emphasizing that it should be suspended. Also, there's a note about working with the cab closed.\n\nWait, the question is about checking the coupling shaft length. The context mentions checking the machine's condition, but does it specifically mention the coupling shaft length? Let me scan again. \n\nThe context includes \"Contrôlez l'état du tracteur et de la machine avant de les utiliser\" which translates to checking the tractor and machine's condition before use. Under that, the points listed are about the machine being in good working order, safety devices, lighting, and braking. There's no explicit mention of coupling shaft length. \n\nAnother part says \"Ne placez jamais la machine sur le sol lors du remplissage mais laissez-la toujours suspendue au dispositif de levage du tracteur.\" This is about not placing the machine on the ground during filling, but that's related to filling, not coupling shaft length. \n\nThe question is about a specific precaution related to checking the coupling shaft length. Since the context doesn't mention coupling shaft length or any specific steps related to checking it, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking for the maximum permissible operating angle in degrees for the coupling shaft, both when lifted and lowered. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of angles related to the coupling shaft. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse that carefully.\n\nLooking at the entries, entry 31 mentions \"Angle de travail arbre d'accouplement\" which translates to \"Working angle of the coupling shaft.\" The numbers 51, 54 are listed next to it. Then, entry 35 is \"Angle de travail\" with 51, 54 again. \n\nWait, entry 7 talks about \"Angle de la prise de force en dehors de la zone de travail\" which is \"Angle of the power take-off outside the working area,\" and it says to limit the angle to 30º maximum. But that's for the power take-off, not the coupling shaft. \n\nSo the key part here is entry 31 and 35. The numbers 51 and 54 are probably page numbers or references. The actual angle mentioned is 30º in entry 7, but that's for the power take-off angle. The question is about the coupling shaft's operating angle. \n\nWait, maybe the numbers 51 and 54 refer to sections in the manual where the angle is specified. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the angle value for the coupling shaft. The only angle mentioned is 30º for the power take-off. \n\nBut the user is asking specifically about the coupling shaft. Since the context doesn't mention a specific angle for the coupling shaft's operating angle when lifted and lowered, the answer might be that it's not found. However, entry 31 and 35 have the angle de travail (working angle) with references 51,54. If those pages mention the angle, but the context here doesn't include those pages, then we can't know. \n\nWait, the user's context includes entries 31 and 35 with \"Angle de travail arbre d'accouplement\" and \"Angle de travail\" with 51,54. But the actual angle value isn't given here. The only angle value given is 30º in entry 7. So unless there's another mention, the answer might be that it's not found. However, the user might be referring to the same 30º, but that's for the power take-off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the coupling shaft's angle is also 30º. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. Since the question is about the coupling shaft, and the only angle mentioned is 30º for the power take-off, the answer would be that it's not found.

The question is about kg/min, so looking for the application rate in kg/min. \n\nIn the context, there's a mention of \"la vitesse d'écoulement correspondante est de 3,7 kg/min\" which is the corresponding flow rate of 3.7 kg/min. But the question is about the application rate below which the fine application is advised. \n\nWait, the instruction says \"le point d'écoulement conseillé est : D,\" and \"le réglage des ouvertures conseillé est : 12+1 (= 13), la vitesse d'écoulement correspondante est de 3,7 kg/min.\" So the recommended flow rate is 3.7 kg/min. But the question is asking below which rate the fine application is advised. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 3.7 kg/min. Because the context says that the fine application kit is used, and the corresponding flow rate is 3.7 kg/min. So if the application rate is below that, they recommend using the fine application. Wait, but the exact wording is \"la vitesse d'écoulement correspondante est de 3,7 kg/min\" which means the corresponding flow rate is 3.7 kg/min. So maybe the advice is to use the fine application when the rate is below 3.7 kg/min? Or is it the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the table, the first row has 6+0 (which might be 6 kg/min?), and the values 5,4, 4,5, etc. Maybe the application rate in kg/min is the first column.

But the question is about the application rate in kg/min below which the fine application is advised. \n\nWait, the context says \"le kit de dosage fin doit être utilisé\" and \"les réglages indiqués sont basés sur l'utilisation du kit de dosage fin\". So the settings are based on using the fine application kit. The corresponding flow rate is 3.7 kg/min. So maybe the advice is to use the fine application when the rate is below 3.7 kg/min? Or is it that the fine application is used at 3.7 kg/min? \n\nThe exact sentence is: \"la vitesse d'écoulement correspondante est de 3,7 kg/min\" which translates to \"the corresponding flow rate is 3.7 kg/min.\" So the fine application is used at that rate. But the question is asking below which rate it's advised. Maybe the answer is 3.7 kg/min, meaning that if the rate is below that, you should use the fine application.

The context provided is in French, so I need to parse that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context for any mention of a tray test. The context has several entries labeled A, B, C, D, E, and some images. The main text seems to be about adjusting the spreader's settings based on the spread pattern. \n\nLooking at the entries, there's a mention of \"Nappe d'épandage\" which translates to \"spread pattern\" or \"spread sheet.\" The entries describe issues like the spread being too narrow or wide and suggest adjusting the opening by two letters towards A or U. There's also a part about the content of individual tubes differing by up to 15% from the average. \n\nThe key part here is the mention of \"tray test\" in the question.

However, since the exact term \"tray test\" isn't in the context, the answer should be based on the information given. \n\nWait, the context has entries like \"Nappe d'épandage régulière\" which means regular spread pattern, and adjustments for too narrow or wide. The answer should be that the tray test checks the spread pattern's regularity and width. But the exact answer needs to be precise. The context mentions \"Evaluation et adaptation\" which might be part of the test. However, the question is about what the test checks, not the process. \n\nSince the context doesn't explicitly mention a tray test, but the entries describe checking the spread pattern's regularity and adjusting the spreader, the answer should be that the tray test checks the spread pattern's regularity and width. But the user's answer format requires an exact answer from the context. Since the context doesn't mention \"tray test,\" maybe the answer is that it checks the spread pattern's regularity and width. However, the exact answer might be \"the spread pattern's regularity and width\" based on the context. Alternatively, if the context doesn't mention the tray test, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the user's instructions say to base the answer on the context. Since the context talks about evaluating the spread pattern and adjusting, the answer is that the tray test checks the spread pattern's regularity and width. But I need to make sure. The context has entries about the spread being too narrow or wide, so the test checks if the spread is regular and within the correct width. Therefore, the answer is that the tray test checks the spread pattern's regularity and width.\n</think>\n\nThe tray test checks the spread pattern's regularity and width to determine if the spreader is properly adjusted.",

The user is asking, \"After disengaging the PTO shaft, what poses a continued danger and why?\" First, I need to understand what PTO shaft is. PTO stands for Power Take-Off, which is a mechanism used to transfer power from a tractor or engine to an attached implement. Disengaging it would mean stopping that power transfer.\n\nNow, looking at the context provided. The context is in French, so I need to parse through the text. The user mentioned that after disengaging the PTO shaft, what's the danger. Let me check the context for any mention of PTO or related terms. \n\nLooking through the context, there's a part that says: \"Nettoyez l'encrassement que vous pouvez perdre et ainsi répandre sur la route. Une route encrassée constitue un danger pour ses usagers.\" Translating that, it means \"Clean the buildup that you may lose and thus spread on the road. A dirty road constitutes a danger for its users.\" But this seems to be about cleaning buildup on the road, not directly related to PTO.\n\nWait, there's also a part about \"Assurez-vous pour cela que les pièces telles que les câbles, les flexibles, etc., qui activent par exemple à distance des cylindres, soient positionnées de telle sorte qu'elles ne puissent ni activer ni bloquer accidentellement ces derniers !\" Which translates to ensuring that parts like cables, hoses, etc., which activate cylinders remotely, are positioned so they can't accidentally activate or block them. But again, not directly about PTO.\n\nWait, maybe the PTO shaft is mentioned elsewhere. Let me check again. The context starts with instructions in French, like lowering the lifting device, locking the control, checking lights, etc. Then there's a section about the spreader (épandeur) and adjusting the opening. The question is about PTO shaft disengagement. \n\nHmm, maybe the PTO shaft is related to the machine's operation. If the PTO is disengaged, perhaps the machine is still in motion, and there's a risk of parts moving. But the context doesn't mention PTO shaft specifically. The only mention of danger is about the road being dirty. However, the question is about PTO shaft disengagement. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to a situation where after disengaging the PTO, there's a risk of the machine's parts still moving. But the context doesn't mention that. The only danger mentioned is the road being dirty. However, the question is about PTO shaft disengagement. Since the context doesn't mention PTO shaft, maybe the answer is that the continued danger is the buildup on the road because of the machine's operation, but the context doesn't explicitly link PTO disengagement to that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the PTO shaft is part of the machine that, when disengaged, could still cause parts to move, leading to the buildup. But the context doesn't specify that. The answer might be that the continued danger is the buildup on the road, as per the context, but the reason is that the machine's operation (possibly related to PTO) causes it. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that. \n\nSince the context doesn't mention PTO shaft disengagement directly, but the question is about it, maybe the answer is that the continued danger is the buildup on the road because the machine's operation (after disengaging PTO) could spread it. But the context doesn't explicitly link PTO disengagement to the buildup. Therefore, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" because the context doesn't mention PTO shaft disengagement. However, the user might be expecting the answer related to the road being dirty. But the question is about PTO shaft disengagement.

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of white metal or corrosion prevention during storage.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a lot about corrosion and maintenance steps. The first part mentions that fertilizers and other corrosive substances affect corrosion speed. Then there's advice to clean the machine after each use and fix paint damage. It also talks about applying protective liquid to metal parts after cleaning. \n\nFurther down, there's a list of precautions when using a high-pressure cleaner, like surface fragilization, deformation, leaks, etc. Then there's a mention of using original replacement parts, proper installation, and using stainless steel hose clamps. \n\nWait, the question is about white metal parts specifically. The context mentions \"pieces d'attelage\" (attachment parts) and corrosion of these parts. However, the term \"white metal\" isn't directly used. But maybe \"white metal\" refers to certain types of metal parts that are prone to corrosion. \n\nIn the context, there's a part that says \"corrosion de la pièce d'attelage au détriment du fonctionnement et de la solidité\" which translates to corrosion of the attachment part harming function and solidity. The user is asking about white metal parts, which might be a specific type of metal. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention \"white metal\" or any specific precautions for that material. \n\nThe answer needs to be precise and based solely on the context. Since there's no direct mention of white metal parts or specific precautions for them during winter storage, the correct response would be that the information isn't found in the context.

There's a copyright notice but no mention of maintenance schedules or checking intervals for the spreading discs. \n\nThe user's question is about ensuring good distribution by checking the discs when they spread the same volumes. However, the context doesn't provide any information regarding how often these checks should be performed. There's no mention of maintenance intervals, calibration steps, or any related procedures. \n\nSince the context doesn't contain the required information, the correct answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions.

The user is asking about the maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the middle trough as a percentage in a ditch. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context has several sections, including some images and text. The relevant part seems to be under the \"Opérations avant l'épandage\" and \"Evaluation et adaptation\" sections.\n\nLooking at the text, there's a mention of \"La perte maximale autorisée dans la tranchée est définie dans une norme environnementale.\" This translates to the maximum allowed loss in the ditch being defined by an environmental standard. Then it says, \"la quantité d'engrais dans le premier bac de collecte situé dans la tranchée fictive peut représenter au maximum 10 % de la quantité contenue dans le bac de collecte au centre de l'ornière (= 10,0 %).\" \n\nSo, the first collection tank in the fictitious ditch can have up to 10% of the quantity in the middle trough. That implies the maximum allowed loss is 10%. The question is about the maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the middle trough, but the context specifies that the first tank's quantity is 10% of the middle trough's. Therefore, the maximum allowed loss is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of percentages related to the middle trough.

The user is asking, \"From which machine point is the spreading height measured to the ground or the crop?\" So, I need to find the specific part of the machine mentioned in the context that relates to measuring the spreading height.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context provided. The context is in French, so I need to be careful with the terminology. The key terms here are \"spreading height\" which might translate to \"hauteur d'épandage\" or something similar. The question is about the point on the machine from which this height is measured.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a mention of \"point de chute\" which translates to \"fall point\" or \"drop point.\" There's also a reference to \"point de jonction de l'arbre de transmission\" which is the \"transmission shaft junction point.\" Another part mentions \"point d'écoulement\" which is \"flow point\" or \"discharge point.\" \n\nThe context also talks about the \"réglage du point d'écoulement\" (adjustment of the flow point) and how the spreader's width is determined by the rotation speed of the spreader disk and the selected junction point on the transmission shaft. The \"point de chute\" is mentioned in the image notes, and there's a reference to \"hauteur d'épandage\" in the context. \n\nWait, the exact phrase \"hauteur d'épandage\" is mentioned in the context. Let me check again. The context says: \"La nappe d'épandage est également déterminée par la répartition transversale.\" Then later, \"C'est au point d'écoulement que les grains d'engrais entrent en contact avec les aubes sur le disque d'épandage...\" So the spreader's spread is determined by the transverse distribution, and at the flow point, the fertilizer grains contact the spreader disk's blades. \n\nBut the question is about the height measurement. The term \"hauteur d'épandage\" is mentioned in the context. Let me look for that exact term. The context says: \"La largeur de travail de la machine est principalement déterminée par le régime du disque d'épandage.\" Then later, \"La nappe d'épandage est également déterminée par la répartition transversale.\" So \"nappe d'épandage\" refers to the spreader's spread or the spread pattern. \n\nBut the question is about the height measurement. The term \"hauteur d'épandage\" isn't directly mentioned. However, there's a mention of \"point de chute\" which is the drop point. The context also has a note about \"point de chute\" in the image, and the numbers 4 and 65. The image might show the drop point as the measurement reference. \n\nWait, the context mentions \"point de chute\" in the image notes. The user is asking from which machine point the spreading height is measured. If \"point de chute\" is the drop point, that might be the point where the height is measured. Alternatively, the \"point d'écoulement\" (flow point) could be where the fertilizer contacts the blades, but the height measurement might be from the drop point. \n\nLooking back, the context says: \"C'est au point d'écoulement que les grains d'engrais entrent en contact avec les aubes sur le disque d'épandage, ce qui est déterminant pour la répartition de la largeur.\" So the flow point is where the fertilizer contacts the blades, affecting the spread width. But the height measurement might be from the drop point. \n\nHowever, the exact answer might be \"point de chute\" as the measurement point for height. The context mentions \"point de chute\" in the image notes, and the numbers 4 and 65. Since the question is about the height measurement, and the context doesn't explicitly state \"hauteur d'épandage\" but refers to \"point de chute\" as the drop point, which is likely the reference point for height. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"point de chute\" as the machine point from which the spreading height is measured.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \npoint de chute",

Maybe there's a translation nuance here. \n\nThe user is asking about the 'first path', but the context talks about a 'second passage'. However, the instruction mentions \"1 largeur de travail (X mètres) de distance par rapport à la bordure de parcelle.\" The key part here is \"X mètres\" which is \"X meters\". But the question is about the distance tolerance from the field edge. \n\nWait, the question is about the distance tolerance when driving the 'first path' for border spreading. The context mentions a second pass, but maybe the first path is the initial one. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the distance tolerance for the first path. It only mentions that during the second pass, they maintain a distance of X meters from the field edge. \n\nBut the user is asking for the distance tolerance, which might be the X meters mentioned. However, the context doesn't specify what X is. The only numerical value given is 109 mm, which is related to the distance between the rope and the discharge ring. \n\nWait, the question is about meters, but the context mentions 109 mm. The user's question is about meters, but the answer might be in millimeters. However, the question specifically asks for meters. \n\nWait, the context says \"1 largeur de travail (X mètres) de distance par rapport à la bordure de parcelle.\" So the distance from the field edge is X meters. But the question is about the distance tolerance. However, the context doesn't specify what X is. It just says X meters. \n\nBut the user is asking for the distance tolerance. If the context doesn't provide a specific value for X, then the answer would be that it's not found. However, maybe the X is referring to the 109 mm mentioned later. Wait, no. The 109 mm is about the distance between the rope and the discharge ring, not the field edge. \n\nSo, the context mentions that during the second pass, the distance from the field edge is X meters, but X isn't specified. Therefore, the answer would be that the distance tolerance isn't provided in the context. However, the user might be referring to the first path, but the context only mentions the second pass. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first path is the initial pass, and the second pass is the one where they adjust the distance. But the context doesn't mention the first path's distance tolerance. Therefore, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context. \n\nWait, the user's question is about the 'first path', but the context talks about a 'second passage'. The instruction says \"Effectuez un deuxième passage sur 1 largeur de travail (X mètres) de distance par rapport à la bordure de parcelle.\" So the second pass is done at X meters from the field edge. But the question is about the first path. Since the context doesn't mention the first path's distance, the answer would be that it's not found. \n\nBut maybe the X meters is the distance tolerance for the first path.

Page 2 repeats some of that info and includes details about the manufacturer, Kverneland Group, and mentions copyrights and rights reservations. \n\nNowhere in the context does it mention anything about a 'plastic seal' or its material specifications. The terms like 'plastic seal' aren't present. The context focuses on machine identification, serial numbers, and copyright notices. There's no technical detail about seals, their materials, or specifications. \n\nSince the question is about a specific material specification that isn't covered in the provided text, the correct response would be that the information isn't found in the context. The user might need to refer to another document or source for that detail.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The first page mentions \"Manuel d'utilisation\" and some technical details like software version and serial numbers. The second page has information about the machine identification, including the type of machine, serial number, and addresses. There's also a note about copyright and technical modifications. \n\nWait, the question is about the material of the metal seal rings. The context provided doesn't mention anything about materials, seal rings, or agitator axles. The content is about the machine's specifications, serial numbers, and company information. There's no technical detail regarding the materials used in the seals. \n\nSince the context doesn't have any information related to the material of the metal seal rings, the correct answer should be that it's not found in the context. The user might have expected some details about materials, but based on the given text, there's nothing to reference.

The user is asking about the optimal length in meters for an ISO 11786 extension cable used in a tractor's cab connection.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context mentions several things: there's a cable with 7-pin connectors for ISO 11786, some images, and instructions on mounting. The key part here is the mention of \"Câble de rallonge ISO\" which translates to \"ISO extension cable.\" \n\nLooking through the text, there's a line that says \"Juste après le câble de raccordement ISO 11786 dans la cabine\" which means \"Just after the ISO 11786 connection cable in the cab.\" But that's about positioning, not length. \n\nAnother part says \"Montez sur le connecteur 7 broches du câble de raccordement « IsoMatch Tellus » fourni en standard une rallonge de câble (option) vers la connexion tracteur ISO 11786 en cabine.\" This translates to mounting the extension cable on the 7-pin connector. However, there's no mention of the length here either. \n\nThe context also mentions \"144\" which might be a model number or a code, but not related to length. The rest of the text talks about connecting sensors, using the IsoMatch Tellus, and other cables like RS232, but nothing about the length of the extension cable. \n\nSince the question is about the optimal length in meters, and the context doesn't specify any numerical value for the length, the answer would be that the information isn't found. The user might be expecting a standard length, but based on the given context, there's no mention of meters or specific length. Therefore, the correct response is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking about the valve type and manufacturer used for the 'valve set' that comes with a hopper empty sensor. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any relevant information. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse through it carefully. Let me scan through the text.\n\nThe context mentions several things related to granulometry, cleaning sieves, and some instructions about fertilizer spreading. There's a part about the granulometry values 0-70-30-0 and some warnings about fertilizer distribution. Then there's a section about the properties of fertilizer, determining the type and form of granules, and a note about using the correct spreader table based on fertilizer type. \n\nWait, there's also a mention of a hopper empty sensor. Let me check again. The user's question is about a 'valve set' that comes with a hopper empty sensor. The context has a part that says: \"Opérations avant l'épandage Données correctes pour le réglage du distributeur d'engrais\" which translates to \"Operations before spreading Correct data for adjusting the fertilizer distributor.\" Then there's a mention of \"Propriétés de l'engrais\" (Fertilizer properties) and \"Détermination du type et de la forme des granulés\" (Determining the type and form of granules). \n\nLooking further, there's a line: \"INDICATION Les caractéristiques des divers types d'engrais diffèrent tellement les unes des autres que l'utilisation d'un tableau d'épandage d'un autre type d'engrais que le vôtre, même lorsque la granulométrie est la même, peut entraîner une nappe d'épandage irrégulière et endommager la végétation ! 57\" which means that using a spreader table for a different fertilizer type can cause irregular spreading and damage vegetation. \n\nBut I don't see any mention of a valve type or manufacturer related to a hopper empty sensor. The context talks about cleaning the sieve, granulometry values, and fertilizer properties, but nothing about valves, manufacturers, or a hopper empty sensor. \n\nSince the question is about a valve set with a hopper empty sensor, and the context doesn't provide any information on that specific component, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions. There's no mention of valve types or manufacturers in the given text. Therefore, the correct response is that the information isn't present in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",
