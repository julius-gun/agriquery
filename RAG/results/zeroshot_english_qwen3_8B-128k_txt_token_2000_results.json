The user is asking how the tractor's driving speed is transmitted to the IsoMatch if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. Looking through the pages, especially page 32 and 33. On page 32, there's a section about adapting non-ISO tractors with the IsoMatch power cable set. It mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you can add it with the IsoMatch power cable set. Then, the driving speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch. \n\nWait, but the question is about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So, the answer must involve the IsoMatch power cable set. Also, there's a mention of connecting a speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor's electronics. \n\nSo, the key points are: using the IsoMatch power cable set to add ISOBUS communication, and then connecting a speed sensor or adapter cable to get the speed signal. The answer should specify that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after adding the IsoMatch power cable set, and that the speed sensor or adapter cable is connected to the IsoMatch. \n\nWait, but the exact answer needs to be precise. Let me check again. The context says: \"If speed is not measured on the (trailed) machine, but via the tractor, the speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics.\" So, the method is connecting the speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch. \n\nBut the question is about transmitting the speed when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So, the answer is that the IsoMatch power cable set is used to add ISOBUS, and then the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS.

The key part here is that the answer is about the duration needed to turn it off, which is at least 1 second. The question is about turning it on or off, so the answer is that you need to press it for at least 1 second to turn it off.

The key part here is: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine.\" \n\nAdditionally, on page 51, there's a similar statement: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam wit the power lift in the highest position.\" Also, it mentions turning off the tractor engine and removing the keys from the ignition. \n\nThe question specifically asks about the precaution before working between the tractor and machine. The main points from the context are putting the machine on a supporting beam, ensuring the power lift is in the highest position, turning off the tractor engine, and removing the keys. However, the exact answer needs to be precise. \n\nThe instruction says to focus only on the specific information related to the question.

Also, the flowrate calculation formula is provided. But the question is specifically about enabling fine application, so the key steps are adjusting the handle and closing two openings. The exact answer should mention using the fine application handle, closing two of three dosing openings, and setting the handle to the desired position.

Also, mention the calculation part if needed. But the question is about enabling, so the main steps are the handle adjustment and closing the openings. Let me check the exact instructions again. The steps are: switch off tractor, pull the hand-grip, set the handle until the arrow indicates the position, check if locked, and do the same for the other disc. Also, the dosing setting is determined by the spreading chart and control system. But the question is about enabling, so the answer should focus on the handle adjustment and closing two openings. The answer needs to be precise and concise, so the key points are using the fine application handle, closing two of three openings, and setting the handle. Also, the note about not using the indicated discharge point. Wait, the context says \"Do not use the discharge point indicated there!\" which is part of the instructions. So the answer should include that. \n\nSo the answer is: Adjust the fine application handle to close two of three dosing openings, set the handle to the desired position using the arrow indicator, and ensure it's locked. Also, do not use the discharge point indicated there. But the exact answer needs to be as per the context. Let me check the exact text. The context says: \"Close 2 of the 3 dosing openings to prevent blockages. The remaining opening must be further opened as the application rate with the constant flowrate would be three times as much. The handle to close 2 of the 3 fine dosing openings is located at the outside of the spreading disc, above a similar handle for the discharge point.

Also, the handle has indications for 3 open holes (standard) or 1 open and 2 thick (fine). The note says not to use the discharge point indicated there. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be: Adjust the fine application handle to close two of three dosing openings by setting it to the position indicated by 1 open hole and 2 thick holes.

The text mentions: \"If a fixed loading platform is used, drive the machine to the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must be a maximum of 200 mm.\" That seems directly related to the question. \n\nAnother mention on the same page: \"If a mobile loading platform is being used, place the loading platform at the spreader so that there would be a maximum distance of 200 mm between the two.\" So both fixed and mobile platforms have a maximum distance of 200 mm. \n\nI should check other pages to ensure there's no conflicting information. Pages 72, 73, 75, and 76 don't mention the distance between spreader and loading platform. The rest of the context talks about safety procedures, application rates, and other setup steps, but not the specific distance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 200 mm.

The second bullet point says: \"see that a spreading disc is spreading irregularly or not at all while the dosing units are open.\" \n\nThe corresponding instruction for that scenario is to stop spreading immediately and disconnect the PTO shaft. The context also mentions to refer to the software instruction manual for more details. \n\nSo the answer should include stopping immediately, disconnecting the PTO shaft, and checking the manual. I need to make sure it's concise and directly quotes the relevant part. Let me verify there's no other mention of spreading discs. The rest of the context talks about other issues like blockages or damage, but the specific instruction for irregular spreading is in that bullet point. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be: Stop spreading immediately! Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately! and refer to the software manual. But the user wants the answer to be as precise as possible, so maybe just the first two actions since the manual is mentioned as a reference. Wait, the exact text says \"Stop spreading immediately! Disconnect the PTO shaft immediately!\" and then refers to the manual. So the answer should include those two actions.\n</think>\n\nStop spreading immediately!

Looking at page 36, there's a table under \"Technical specifications\" for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD with different models: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. \n\nIn the table, row 10 is labeled \"Without hopper cover (kg)\" and the values are 277,5 for 1875, 307,5 for 2550, 337,5 for 3225, and 367,5 for 3900. The question is about the 3225 model, so the corresponding value is 337.5 kg. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of hopper weight, but the context doesn't seem to have conflicting information. The answer should be precise, so I need to make sure the number is correctly formatted as per the context, which uses commas as decimal separators. Therefore, the answer is 337.5 kg.\n</think>\n\n337.5",

The rows are numbered 0 to 20. The fifth row (row 5) mentions \"Weight (kg)\" and lists numbers: 705, 735, 765, 795. These correspond to different models, likely the 1875, 2550, 3225, and 3900 variants. \n\nSince the question is about the 3900 model, the last number in that row should be 795 kg. I need to confirm that the 3900 is the fourth entry here. The entries under \"Weight (kg)\" are 705, 735, 765, 795, which correspond to the models listed in the first column: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. So the 3900 model's weight is 795 kg.\n\nI should check if there's any other mention of weight elsewhere in the context. Scanning through the other pages, there's a mention of \"Maximum total weight (kg)\" on page 36, row 8, which is 4895 kg for all models. But that's the total weight, not the machine's own weight. The question specifically asks for the weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900, which refers to the machine's weight, not the total with the hopper or other attachments. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 795 kg.\n</think>\n\n795 kg",

Looking at the table, there's an entry for \"Condition of the vanes\" with the code 4. The interval listed next to it is \"·\" which probably indicates a specific frequency. \n\nWait, the table has entries with different intervals. For example, \"Inspection\" is listed under daily, after the first 10 hours, weekly, every 100 hours, etc. But for the vanes (entry 4), the interval is just \"·\" in the \"min. 1 x per year\" column.

The user is asking about the torque in Nm required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant section in the provided context. The context has several pages, and the question relates to tightening torques. Looking through the pages, page 129 and 130 discuss steel tightening torques and stainless steel ones. \n\nOn page 129, there's a table under \"Steel tightening torques\" with different quality and friction coefficients. The entry for M18 under the 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction coefficient is listed. Let me check that again. \n\nThe table on page 129 lists for Quality 10.9, friction 0.13, the torque for M18 is 300 Nm. Wait, looking at the data:\n\nFor M18, under the 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction, the value is 300 Nm. The table shows for 10.9 quality, the 0.13 column has 300 for M18. \n\nBut wait, the table on page 129 has entries like:\n\nFor Quality 10.9, friction 0.10 and 0.13. Let me check the exact line. \n\nLooking at the text:\n\n\"Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13.\"\n\nThen the rows:\n\n7                        M18                90               110               250               290                350                420                410                490\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse this correctly. The table on page 129 has different quality and friction combinations. The first part says:\n\nQuality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13. Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13. Torques.12.9.0,10. Torques.12.9.0,13.\n\nThen the rows start with 0,1,2, etc. for M5, M6, etc. \n\nSo for M18, the line is:\n\n7                        M18                90               110               250               290                350                420                410                490\n\nBut the headers might be for different qualities. Let me think. The first part mentions Quality.Friction, then Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. So the first set is 4.6 quality with friction 0.10 and 0.13. Then 8.8, then 10.9, then 12.9. \n\nEach row corresponds to the M size. For example, the first row (0) is M5, then 1 is M6, etc. So for M18, which is row 7, the values under 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction would be the third number in the row? Wait, the structure is a bit unclear. Let me parse the text again.\n\nThe text on page 129:\n\n\"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13.

On page 29, it mentions ExactLine allowing spreading up to the border, but it also states that environmental standards only permit minimal loss over the field edge. However, the question is about small gardens, which might have different requirements compared to larger fields.\n\nThen, on page 28, there's a mention of one-sided boundary spreading using a border spreading plate. It says that driving along the field edge with a half spreading pattern filled to 100% is possible with the border spreading plate and one closed dosing unit. But the context doesn't explicitly mention small gardens. The focus seems to be on agricultural fields and environmental compliance. \n\nThe context doesn't discuss small gardens specifically.

The user is asking, \"For what other kind of connections can the IM Tellus Input cable be used?\" So I need to find the exact information from the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context to locate mentions of the IM Tellus Input cable.

Let me check that section again.\n\nOn page 69, there's a part that says: \"Suppose you would want to spread slug pellets with the characteristics given in the spreading chart below: With a working width of 12 metres, a driving speed of 8 km/h and a selected application rate of 23 kg/ha.\" Then it mentions the recommended discharge point D, dosing setting 12+1, flowrate 3.7 kg/min, and the fine application kit must be used. \n\nFurther down, there's a section labeled \"SlugPellets\" followed by images and some text. Then there's a line that says \"Schnecken Linsen Delicia\" which seems to be the name of the product. The term \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" is mentioned here. \n\nWait, the exact phrase in the context is \"Schnecken Linsen Delicia\". The question asks for the specific type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' slug pellets. The context mentions \"Schnecken Linsen Delicia\" which is the same as \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" but the order is different. However, since it's a product name, the order might not matter. \n\nLooking at the context again, there's an image labeled \"Delicia\" under the SlugPellets section. So the specific type is Delicia Schnecken Linsen. The answer should be exactly that, as per the context. The example in the spreading chart refers to these pellets. \n\nI need to confirm there's no other mention of different types. The context only mentions \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" in that section. Therefore, the answer is Delicia Schnecken Linsen.\n</think>\n\nDelicia Schnecken Linsen",

Looking through the pages, on page 95, there's a section about \"Spreading height\" which mentions that the distance from the bottom of the vanes to the ground or crop must be 75 cm. \n\nThe exact sentence is: \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" The question is about the tolerance, but the context doesn't mention any tolerance value. It only specifies the required distance as 75 cm. Since there's no information about a tolerance range or allowable deviation, the answer should state that the required distance is 75 cm, and since tolerance isn't specified, the answer would be that there's no mentioned tolerance, but the exact measurement is 75 cm. However, the user might be expecting the 75 cm as the answer, even though the question is about tolerance. Wait, maybe the question is phrased as \"tolerance for 'measured distance...'\", but the context only gives the exact value without any tolerance. So the answer should be that the required distance is 75 cm, and since tolerance isn't mentioned, perhaps the answer is \"75 cm\" as the exact value, and the tolerance isn't specified.

The context is technical, so I should focus on sections discussing border spreading, application rates, and speed adjustments.\n\nLooking at the pages, page 108 mentions the procedure with the hydraulic border spreading plate. It says, \"The control system will drive the dosing units in such a way that the actual application rate is equal to the set application rate through the lower PTO shaft RPM.\" This suggests that adjusting the PTO shaft RPM affects the application rate. \n\nFurther, on page 109, under \"Working from the sprayer tramlines (situation A)\", there's a mention: \"Decrease the PTO shaft rpm to 75%.\" This is during the first pass when using the border spreading plate. However, the question is about the optimal speed reduction percentage specifically for border spreading. \n\nWait, the user is asking about driving speed reduction, not PTO RPM. But the context might be using PTO RPM as a proxy for speed. The instruction says to decrease PTO shaft rpm to 75% when driving the first path. However, the exact percentage related to application rate compensation might be tied to this 75% reduction. \n\nAnother part on page 108 mentions that the control system adjusts dosing based on PTO RPM. So, if the speed is reduced, the PTO RPM is adjusted, which in turn affects the application rate. The optimal speed reduction percentage here is 75% as per the context. \n\nBut wait, the question is about driving speed reduction, not PTO RPM. However, the context might not explicitly state a percentage for driving speed. The mention of 75% is about PTO RPM, which is related to the speed. So, the answer might be 75% reduction in PTO RPM, which is used to compensate for application rate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 75% as per the instruction on page 109. The user might be referring to the PTO RPM reduction as the speed adjustment. Since the context doesn't mention a specific percentage for driving speed directly, but the closest is 75% for PTO RPM, which is likely the intended answer.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n75% reduction in PTO shaft rpm.",

In that section, under item 4, it says \"Condition of the vanes\" and mentions \"min. 1 x per year\" and \"Page 43\". Wait, the page number might be a typo or reference. But the key part here is that the vanes are part of the maintenance checks. However, the context doesn't explicitly state how many hours they last before replacement. \n\nAnother part mentions \"Replace\" under item 19, but that's under \"Maintenance intervals\" and refers to general replacement, not specific hours. The question is about operational hours until replacement is needed. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide a specific number of hours for the vanes' lifespan, only that they need to be checked as part of regular maintenance, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context. The user might be looking for a number, but the text doesn't specify it. Therefore, the correct response is \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking about the type of suitable lubricant recommended for connectors to prevent corrosion. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The relevant section is on page 128 under \"Maintenance\" and \"Add oil\" section. The context mentions: \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors. Oiling the connectors will prevent them from corroding and becoming difficult to use.\"\n\nNow, the question is about what type of lubricant is recommended. The context says \"a suitable lubricant\" but doesn't specify the type. However, earlier in the context, on page 126, it mentions using a universal grease type for lubricating nipples. Also, on page 127, there's mention of gear wheel grease EP 00/000. But the exact term \"suitable lubricant\" is used in the connectors part. \n\nWait, the answer needs to be precise. The context doesn't explicitly state a specific type beyond \"suitable lubricant.\" However, the instruction says to base the answer strictly on the context. Since the context doesn't specify a particular type beyond \"suitable,\" but in the maintenance instructions, they mention using grease for nipples and gearboxes. However, the connectors part specifically says \"apply a suitable lubricant,\" but the exact type isn't given. \n\nWait, looking again: the context says \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors.\" The answer should be exactly what's in the context. Since the context doesn't specify a particular type beyond \"suitable lubricant,\" but maybe the answer is that it's a grease? Wait, earlier pages mention universal grease and gear wheel grease. But the connectors part doesn't specify. \n\nWait, the user's question is about the type of lubricant. The context says \"suitable lubricant\" but doesn't name a specific type. However, in the maintenance instructions, they mention using grease for various parts. But the connectors part specifically says \"apply a suitable lubricant,\" but the exact type isn't specified. Therefore, the answer would be that the context doesn't specify a particular type beyond \"suitable lubricant.\" However, the user might expect that since the context mentions grease elsewhere, maybe the answer is grease. But the exact wording in the context for the connectors is \"suitable lubricant,\" not specifying. \n\nWait, the answer must be exactly what's in the context. The context says \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors.\" So the answer is \"suitable lubricant,\" but the user might be expecting a specific type. However, the context doesn't mention a specific type for connectors beyond that. Therefore, the answer is that the context states \"suitable lubricant\" but doesn't specify a type. However, the user's question is about the type, so if the context doesn't specify, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Wait, but the instruction says if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nWait, the context says \"Apply a suitable lubricant to the drive axles and connectors.\" The answer is that the type is \"suitable lubricant,\" but the context doesn't specify a particular type. Therefore, the answer is that the context doesn't specify a specific type beyond \"suitable lubricant,\" so the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the user's question is about the type, so if the context doesn't specify, then the answer is \"Unknown.\" However, maybe the answer is that the lubricant is grease, as mentioned in other parts. But the connectors part specifically says \"suitable lubricant,\" not grease. \n\nWait, the answer must be based strictly on the context.

On Page 150, there's a mention of a \"pellet sieve\" but that's unrelated. The rest of the pages talk about other accessories like calibration containers, drain kits, hopper extensions, etc., but none of them mention the valve type or manufacturer. \n\nThe troubleshooting section on Page 152 mentions dosing settings but not the valve. The question specifically asks for the valve type and manufacturer, but the context only states that the valve set comes with the sensor. There's no additional information about the valve's specifications or brand. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide details on the valve type or manufacturer, the correct answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions. The user might need to refer to other documentation or the spare parts manual mentioned in the text, but based solely on the given context, there's no answer.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of the drain kit's specifications.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section on page 149 under Accessories that mentions a drain kit. It says, \"A drain kit is available for emptying the hopper quickly.\" However, the text doesn't specify any numerical value related to the drain rate, like liters per minute. \n\nI should check if there's any other part of the context that might mention the drain kit's capacity or flow rate. Scanning through the other pages, the rest of the content discusses various accessories like hopper extensions, calibration containers, and troubleshooting issues, but nothing else about the drain kit's flow rate. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide any specific numbers or rates for the drain kit, the answer must be that the information isn't found. The user might be expecting a figure, but based on the given text, there's no data on liters per minute. Therefore, the correct response is to state that it's not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The question mentions 'sail' as part of the hopper cover. Maybe the sail is made of a specific material.

The context talks about the function of the hopper cover, like protecting against humidity and dirt, but not the material composition or UV properties. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide details on the sail's material or UV resistance, the correct answer should be that this information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",
