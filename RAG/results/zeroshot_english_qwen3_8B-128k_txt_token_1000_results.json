Then, the driving speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch. \n\nWait, but the question is about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So, the answer must involve adapting the tractor with the IsoMatch power cable set. The context says that after adding the IsoMatch power cable set, the tractor becomes ISOBUS ready, allowing the speed to be transmitted through ISOBUS. \n\nBut the user is specifically asking about the method when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that the IsoMatch power cable set is used to add ISOBUS communication, enabling the speed transmission. So the direct answer is using the IsoMatch power cable set to enable ISOBUS, which then transmits the speed. But the question is about how the speed is transmitted when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that the IsoMatch power cable set is used to add ISOBUS, allowing the speed to be sent via ISOBUS. \n\nSo the precise answer is: Connect the IsoMatch power cable set to enable ISOBUS communication, allowing the tractor's speed to be transmitted via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch by connecting the IsoMatch power cable set to enable ISOBUS communication, allowing the speed signal to be sent via ISOBUS.",

The user is asking how often the agitator seal must be replaced, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant information in the context. The context has several pages, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at Page 124, there's a section about maintenance intervals. The table lists various parts and their maintenance actions. The entry for \"21\" mentions \"agitator seal\" and specifies that it should be checked. However, the context doesn't mention a replacement interval for the agitator seal here. It just says to check it.\n\nMoving to Page 125, under Maintenance intervals, there's a list of tasks. The entry for \"21\" again refers to the agitator seal, stating that it should be checked. But again, there's no mention of replacement frequency. The instruction is to check it, not replace it at specific intervals.\n\nOn Page 126, the context talks about lubricating points and mentions checking the agitator seal. However, the exact instruction is to check the condition, not to replace it. The text says, \"Check the condition of the protection sleeves and the check chains. Replace them if damaged.\" But this is about the protection sleeves and check chains, not the agit'tor seal itself.\n\nWait, the question is about replacing the agitator seal. The context mentions checking the agitator seal in the maintenance intervals (page 125, entry 21), but there's no specific interval given for replacement. The instructions are about checking, not replacing. The user is asking for the replacement interval, but the context doesn't specify when it should be replaced. It only mentions checking it as part of maintenance tasks.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the context doesn't provide information on the replacement interval for the agitator seal. The only mention is checking it during maintenance, but there's no specific interval given for replacement. So the correct response is \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking about the torque in Nm required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has several pages, and the relevant information is probably on page 129. Let me check that.\n\nOn page 129, there's a section about steel tightening torques. The table lists different torque values for various bolt sizes and qualities. The entries mention different friction coefficients, 0.10 and 0.13. The question specifies a 0.13 friction, so I need to look for that.\n\nLooking at the table, under the M18 row, the values for 0.13 friction are listed. The entry for M18 under the 0.13 column is 90 Nm. Wait, let me confirm. The table shows for M18, the 0.13 friction value is 90 Nm. But wait, the table might have different entries. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table on page 129 has entries for different qualities. The first part mentions \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13...\" which seems like a formatting issue. Then the actual table starts with M5, M6, etc. For M18, the line is: 7                        M18                90               110               250               290                350                420                410                490. Wait, but the friction coefficients here are 0.10 and 0.13? Wait, the initial part says \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13...\" which might be a formatting error. Maybe the first column is the quality, then friction, then torque. But the exact structure is a bit unclear. However, the user's question specifies a 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. \n\nWait, looking back, the user's question is about a 10.9 quality bolt. The table on page 129 lists different qualities. For example, the first part mentions \"Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13. Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13. Torques.12.9.0,10. Torques.12.9.0,13.\" So the 10.9 quality has entries for 0.10 and 0.13 friction. \n\nLooking at the M18 row, the entry for 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction would be under the 0.13 column. The M18 line in the table is: 7                        M18                90               110               250               290                350                420                410                490. Wait, but the columns might be for different friction coefficients. The initial part mentions 0.10 and 0.13. So for M18, the 0.13 friction value is 90 Nm? Wait, the first column for M18 is 90, which might correspond to 0.13 friction. Let me check the structure again. \n\nThe table on page 129 has columns for different friction coefficients. The first column is for 0.10, the second for 0.13? Wait, the initial text says \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13...\" which might be a formatting error. But the actual table entries for M18 are under the 0.13 column. For example, the M18 line has 90 under the 0.13 column. Wait, the line for M18 is: 7                        M18                90               110               250               290                350                420                410                490.

The user is asking about the torque in Nm required to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The relevant sections are on pages 129 and 130. On page 129, there's a table for steel tightening torques, and on page 130, there's information about stainless steel tightening torques.\n\nLooking at page 130, the context mentions \"Stainless steel tightening torques\" and lists guidelines for torques in Nm for self-locking nuts and hexagon bolts. The specific entry for M6 with 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction is needed. \n\nThe line on page 130 says: \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30\". \n\nWait, the formatting here is a bit unclear. The entries seem to be in a list where each line corresponds to different quality, friction, and torque values. The first part after \"Quality.Friction *\" might be the quality (70 A2) and friction (0.10, 0.20, 0.30). The torque values for 70 (A2) with 0.2 friction would be the second value in that sequence. \n\nBut looking at the structure, the first entry is \"70 (A2).0.10\" which might correspond to 70 (A2) with friction 0.10, then \"70 (A2).0.20\" for friction 0.20, and so on. However, the actual torque values are not explicitly listed here. Wait, maybe the numbers after the friction are the torque values? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the line on page 130 is: \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30\". \n\nThis seems like a list where each entry is \"Quality.Friction\" followed by \"Torques\" and then the values. But the exact numbers might be missing. Wait, maybe the numbers are in the previous page? Let me check page 129 again. \n\nOn page 129, the table lists various torques for different sizes. For example, M6 has values like 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 15, 15, 18. But the context mentions that the friction coefficient of 0.10 applies to oiled sheets, etc., and 0.13 for dry. However, the question is about a 0.2 friction coefficient. \n\nWait, the user is asking about a M6 bolt with 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction. The page 130 mentions \"Torques.70 (A2).0.20\" but the actual torque value isn't listed here. The previous page's table might have the torque values for different friction coefficients. \n\nWait, maybe the numbers on page 129 are for standard friction coefficients. For example, the M6 row has values for 0.10 and 0.13. But the question is about 0.2, which isn't listed there. However, the note on page 129 says that for bolts and nuts with serrated lower edges, there's a 10% extra torque. But the question is about a 0.2 friction coefficient. \n\nWait, the user's question is about a stainless steel bolt, so the page 130 is the relevant one. However, the line on page 130 doesn't have the actual torque values. It seems like the context might be incomplete or formatted in a way that's hard to parse. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers on page 129 are for the 0.10 and 0.13 friction coefficients, and the 0.2 is a higher value.

The user is asking about the environmental standards that determine the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context mentions several pages with information about spreading settings, hydraulic border spreading plates, and testing procedures. \n\nOn page 87, there's a section that says: \"The maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. In order to comply with the standards the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 10,0%).\" \n\nWait, the question is about which environmental standards are used.

The mention of 10% is a requirement, but the actual standard's name isn't provided. \n\nLooking through the rest of the context, there's no mention of specific environmental standards like EU regulations, EPA guidelines, or any other named standards. The text only refers to \"environmental standards\" in general. \n\nSince the question asks for the exact standards, and the context doesn't specify a particular one, the answer should be that it's determined by environmental standards, but the exact name isn't given. However, the user might be expecting the answer to be \"environmental standards\" as per the text. But the instruction says to answer based on the context. Since the context doesn't name a specific standard, the correct answer would be that it's determined by environmental standards, but the exact name isn't provided. However, the user might be looking for the 10% figure as part of the standard. Wait, the question is about the standards, not the percentage. The context says the maximum loss is determined by environmental standards, but doesn't specify which ones. Therefore, the answer should be that it's determined by environmental standards, but since the context doesn't name them, maybe the answer is \"environmental standards\" as per the text. However, the user might be expecting the answer to be \"environmental standards\" as the direct answer. Alternatively, if the context doesn't mention any specific standards, the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Wait, the instruction says if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the context does mention that the maximum acceptable loss is determined by environmental standards, so the answer is that it's determined by environmental standards. However, the question is phrased as \"By which environmental standards...\" implying a specific standard. Since the context doesn't specify, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\" Wait, but the context does state that the maximum acceptable loss is determined by environmental standards. So the answer is that it's determined by environmental standards. But the question is asking for the name of the standard. Since the context doesn't provide a specific name, the answer would be \"Not found in context.\" But the user's instruction says to answer based on the context.

But there's no mention of an international standard such as ISO 11683 or any other. The manual's own guidelines are provided, but the question is about an external standard.\n\nSince the context doesn't mention any specific international standard for the pictograms, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" The user's instructions say to respond with that if unsure.

The user is asking how the corrosion rate on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD compares between coastal and inland agricultural regions. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any information related to corrosion and the factors affecting it. The context mentions that fertiliser and other salts influence the rate of corrosion. It also says to clean the machine after using such materials and to patch paint breaks to protect against corrosion.\n\nNow, the question is about coastal vs. inland regions. Coastal areas are typically more saline, with higher salt content in the air and possibly in the soil or water. Inland areas might have less salt exposure. The context doesn't explicitly mention coastal or inland regions, but it does talk about salts affecting corrosion. \n\nSince the context states that salts (like fertilizers) increase corrosion, it's reasonable to infer that machines in coastal areas, which have higher salt exposure, would experience faster corrosion compared to inland areas where such salts are less prevalent. However, the context doesn't directly compare coastal and inland regions. The answer must be based solely on the given text. \n\nThe text doesn't mention coastal regions specifically, so the answer should be based on the information provided. The key point is that salts (from fertilizers) increase corrosion. If the question is about coastal vs. inland, and the context doesn't specify, but the user is asking for a comparison, the answer would need to infer that coastal areas have more salts, leading to higher corrosion. However, since the context doesn't explicitly state this comparison, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, the context does mention that salts (like fertilizers) influence corrosion. If coastal regions have more salts (like sea salt), then the corrosion rate would be higher there. But the context doesn't mention coastal regions. So the answer can't be directly stated. Therefore, the correct response is \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't compare coastal and inland regions specifically.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The user is asking about the material of the 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context has several pages, and the relevant part is on page 141. Let me check that section again.\n\nOn page 141, under the maintenance instructions, there's a mention of \"Metal seal ring\" with an image. Then, in the steps for replacing the seal, it says: \"Remove the metal seal rings.\" But wait, the question is about the material of these rings. The term \"metal seal rings\" in the context suggests that the material is metal. However, I should check if there's any explicit mention of the material. \n\nLooking again, the context mentions that the agitator axle has a \"plastic seal\" and that the metal seal rings are part of the maintenance process. The term \"metal\" is used directly in the description of the seal rings. There's no other material mentioned for these rings. The plastic seal is a separate component. \n\nSo, the answer should be that the metal seal rings are made of metal. The context doesn't specify any other material, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe material of the 'metal seal rings' is metal.",

The user might be expecting a standard length, but since the context doesn't provide that, I can't assume. \n\nThe instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure.
