Looking through the rest of the context, it seems the focus is on how the machine operates and adjusts dosing based on different settings.

So, this means that when spreading on a field, the pattern fully overlaps.\n\nI should make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.

There's no mention of partial or variable overlap here; it specifically says 100% for the full field spreading.\n\nI don't see any other sections in the context that discuss different overlap percentages beyond this one.

Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.\n\nLooking at Page 28, it talks about different forms of spreading and mentions something about a GEOSPREAD function. It says that with the help of this function, you can get an optimal distribution with minimal environmental impact. It also discusses how the spread pattern changes from a trapezoidal to a triangular shape with full overlap.\n\nMoving on to Page 29, it introduces the ExactLine system. This seems to be related to reducing losses over the field edge by guiding the fertilizer in such a way that it's as complete as possible without going beyond the field. It also mentions an 'Umweltstellung' and 'Ertragsstellung', which are settings for environmental and yield optimization.\n\nPage 30 discusses the ISOBediensystem, which uses ISOBUS communication. The system automatically measures the amount of fertilizer being spread by continuously monitoring it through weight cells. The computer compares this measured quantity with the set dose and adjusts accordingly. It also mentions that the required speed and location are determined by the electronics of the spreader or a GPS sensor.\n\nPage 31 talks about the ISO-Schlepper, which is compatible with IsoMatch. It explains how the system calculates the needed discharge speed using the formula: Benötigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha). The computer uses data from the spreader table and automatic tests every 75 kg or minute to determine the correct dosage and speed setting. This system is optimized for each fertilizer type.\n\nPage 32 continues with ISOBUS functions via IsoMatch, mentioning that it allows for location-based operations and reacting to field variations using GPS and sensors. It also notes that without an ISO-terminal, a Schlepper can use IsoMatch as an ISO-Schlepper by connecting the speed sensor through a specific cable.\n\nPutting this together, the key systems mentioned are the ExactLine on Page 29 and the ISOBediensystem on Page 30. Both systems involve continuous measurement of fertilizer quantity being spread. The ExactLine uses settings to optimize distribution, while the ISO system automatically measures and adjusts dosage based on weight cells and computer monitoring.\n</think>\n\nThe system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread is the **automatic weighing system**. It monitors the amount of fertilizer using weight cells and compares it with the set dose, adjusting as needed.\n\nAnswer: The automatic weighing system continuously measures the fertilizer quantity being spread.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFrom Page 32, I see that there are two main ways a non-ISO Schlepper (tractor) can connect to an IsoMatch system. The first method is using the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz, which allows the tractor to be equipped with ISOBUS communication by adding this cable set. Once connected, the tractor becomes fully ISOBUS-gerüstet and can then communicate with the machine via IsoMatch.\n\nThe second method mentioned is for tractors that already have an ISO-Bedienpult or a similar terminal. In such cases, the speed from the tractor's own sensors can be directly transmitted through the IsoMatch system without needing to rely on ISOBUS communication. This involves connecting specific sensors like the Fahrgeschwindigkeitsensor (speed sensor) and Zapfwellendrehzahlensor (engine RPM sensor) to the IsoMatch terminal.\n\nSo, if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, it can either be retrofitted with the necessary cables or use its existing sensors to send data directly to IsoMatch. This setup ensures that the driving speed is accurately transmitted even without ISOBUS.\n</think>\n\nIf the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication, it can still transmit driving speed via a specialized cable set (IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz) that enables ISOBUS functionality, or by connecting sensors directly to IsoMatch.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 67, there's a section about Feindosierung (which I think is related to dosing or feeding). It mentions that when the outflow speed is lower than 40 kg/min, they recommend using Feindosierung. Then it talks about finding the throughput in the fourth column of the Streutabelle.\n\nOn page 68, there's a section titled \"Streuer einstellen\" which translates to setting up the spreader. It mentions that if you want to spread a low dose (less than 25 kg/ha), the system can't automatically calibrate. Also, it says that when using Feindosier-Set, only one of the three dosing openings is open.\n\nFurther down on page 68, there's a calculation method described. It involves reading Dosierstellung and Auslassöffnung from the Streutabelle. Then, if needed, they compute the required throughput using a formula involving Arbeitsbreite (work width), Fahrgeschwindigkeit (speed), and Ausbringmenge (application rate). The formula given is:\n\nBenötigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)\n\nBut wait, that's the speed needed. However, the question is about flow rate, which I think is the kg/min through the dosing openings.\n\nLooking at page 67 again, it says when using Feindosierung, you can calculate the required flow rate by considering the desired dose and the outflow speed. It also mentions that if you have a low dose or slow speed, only one dosing opening is open, so the flow rate through that single opening must be three times higher to maintain the same dose.\n\nSo, putting this together, the formula for flow rate would involve the number of open dosing openings multiplied by the calculated required speed. Since in Feindosierung, they might use 1 out of 3 openings, you'd multiply the speed by 3. But the general case isn't specified beyond that.\n\nWait, on page 68, there's a mention of using the Streutabelle to find the necessary parameters. The formula given is for calculating the required speed (kg/min) based on work width, speed, and application rate. So perhaps the flow rate is derived from that speed multiplied by the number of open dosing openings.\n\nBut in the context, when Feindosierung is used with 1 opening, the flow rate would be three times the calculated speed. However, without specific instructions for other numbers of openings, I can't generalize beyond that.\n\nSo, the formula provided in the context is:\n\nBenötigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)\n\nBut this gives speed. To get flow rate through one dosing opening, you'd multiply by 3 if using Feindosierung with one opening.\n\nAlternatively, the general formula for flow rate when considering multiple openings would be:\n\nFlow Rate = Number of Openings × Calculated Speed\n\nBut since the context doesn't specify beyond Feindosierung (which uses 1 out of 3), I can only provide that part. However, the question asks for a general formula, so perhaps it's better to state the one provided in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer in kg/min is based on the product of the work width (m), the vehicle speed (km/h), and the application rate (kg/ha). \n\n**Answer:**  \nBenötigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at page 83, there's a table with different scenarios labeled A to E. Each scenario describes how the spreader behaves—either too narrow or too wide. For example, scenario C says the spreader is too broad, and you need to adjust the outlet opening direction upwards (U) by two bookstabs and repeat the test.\n\nMoving on to page 84, it talks about testing the hydraulic boundary spreader. It mentions placing an auger or something similar behind a marked line representing the fictional ditch bank. The distance from this line to the center of the spreader is specified as 2 meters.\n\nPage 85 provides more details about setting up the spreader. It says to place an auger on the land along the fictional ditch and two more in the ditch. Then, when starting the motor, the correct RPM should be set—specifically, it mentions reducing the RPM by 25%, so from 540 to 400 U/min.\n\nWhen operating, the driver must ensure that the spreader is positioned correctly. It says to start driving once the spreader has passed at least 24 meters (or another specified width). The key part here is about the height: \"Der Streuer streut nämlich ungefähr gleich weit nach hinten wie zur Seite.\" Translating this, it means the spreader spreads approximately the same distance backwards as sideways.\n\nNow, focusing on one-sided boundary spreading. From page 85, when setting up for the test, they mention placing an auger in the middle of the field's edge and two more in the ditch. The center of the spreader should be 2 meters away from this marked line (the fictional ditch). So, the height above the troughs would be this distance minus any possible overlap.\n\nWait, but the question is about the required height, not the distance. Since the spreader's center is 2 meters from the edge, and it needs to spread uniformly, the height should be such that it allows the spreader to cover that width without excessive spillage or insufficient coverage.\n\nLooking back at page 83, scenario C mentions adjusting the outlet opening upwards if the spread is too broad. This suggests that increasing the outlet height can help control the spread. However, the exact height isn't directly stated but inferred from the setup.\n\nIn page 85, it says to start driving once the spreader has passed a certain width (24 meters or similar). The spreader's height above the troughs would need to be sufficient to cover this distance without under-spreading or over-spreading. Since the spreader is designed to spread equally in both directions, the height should allow for even distribution.\n\nBut I'm not seeing an exact number given in the context. It mentions 2 meters from the edge but doesn't specify how much above the troughs that translates to. Maybe it's standard practice or inferred from typical setups, but based on the provided text, there isn't a specific height mentioned beyond the 2-meter distance.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. On page 84, when setting up the test, they mention placing an auger behind a line representing the ditch and two more in the ditch. The spreader's center is 2 meters from this line. If the troughs are at that line, then the height of the spreading disc above them would be the distance from the trough to where the spreader is placed.\n\nBut without specific measurements beyond the 2-meter distance, I can't determine an exact height. The context doesn't provide a numerical value for the height; it only specifies distances along the field and directions for adjustments.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, there's no explicit information about the required height of the spreading disc above the troughs in the given context. It focuses more on the setup and adjustments rather than specific measurements.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide an exact measurement for the required height of the spreading disc above the troughs for one-sided boundary spreading.

Page 93 talks about preparing the machine for transport, which includes things like checking lights, brakes, and the PTO shaft. It mentions controlling the PTO shaft's cable movement. Then on page 94, under \"Einsatz auf dem Feld\" (Use on the field), it discusses safety during operations, including not leaving the cab while the machine is running and securing controls.\n\nThe question specifically refers to after disengaging the PTO shaft. From page 93, I see that when the PTO shaft is disconnected, the machine's movement could still be a hazard because of its mass. It says to keep away from the machine until all moving parts are stationary to avoid accidents.\n\nSo, putting it together: After disconnecting the PTO, the continued danger is the potential for the machine to move due to inertia. Therefore, the answer should mention that the machine can still move and cause injury because of its size and weight.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, a continued danger is posed by the potential movement of the machine due to inertia, which could result in accidents.",

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see on page 35 there's a list of technical data for the Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD with different models. The numbers listed are 1875, 2550, 3225, and 3900. These seem to correspond to different weights in kilograms.\n\nLooking at line 1: Behälterinhalt (l) is 1875 kg.\nLine 2: Füllhöhe is 122 cm.\nLine 3: Füllbreite is 284 cm.\nLine 4: Behälterbreite is 290 cm.\nLine 5: Eigengewicht is 705 kg for the first model, then increases to 735, 765, and finally 795 kg.\n\nWait, but the question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900. So I need to find which line corresponds to that model.\n\nLooking at page 36, it starts with technical data again. Line 1: Behälterinhalt (l) is 1875 kg for the first model, then 2550, etc., up to 3900 kg. So each number likely represents a different model or variant.\n\nSo Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 would be the last one in that list, which is 3900 kg. But I should double-check if this is the exact weight or just the maximum load capacity.\n\nWait, line 6: Maximale Zuladung (kg) is 3900 for all models. So it's the maximum loading capacity, not necessarily the weight of the machine itself.\n\nHmm, but earlier on page 35, Eigengewicht (line 5) goes up to 795 kg. Maybe I need to see if 3900 refers to the model name or the weight.\n\nLooking back at line 1: Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD is listed as 1875, 2550, etc., so each number corresponds to a different model. So the 3900 would be the model's name, not its weight.\n\nWait, but in page 36, line 6: Maximales Gesamtgewicht (kg) is 4895 for all models. That might be the total weight of the machine with certain attachments.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900. Since it's listed as a model with 3900 kg, perhaps that's its base weight without any additional load.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3900 is the maximum load capacity, not the machine's weight. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, on page 35, line 5: Eigengewicht (kg) for the 3900 model is 795 kg. So the exact weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 would be 795 kg.\n\nBut earlier, in page 36, line 6: Maximales Gesamtgewicht is 4895 kg, which might include attachments or the entire system.\n\nI think I need to clarify whether 3900 refers to the model name or its weight. Since on page 35, each model has a different Eigengewicht, and the last one is 795 kg, that's probably the exact weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 is **795 kg**.",

The user is asking about the inspection interval for the vanes, so I need to find any mention of vanes in the context.\n\nOn Page 125, under \"Wartungsintervalle\" (which translates to \"Maintenance Intervals\"), there's a list of intervals with numbers from 0 to 23. Each number corresponds to a specific maintenance task. Let me go through each point:\n\n- Point 0: Kontrolle von Schrauben und Muttern (Control of screws and bolts)\n- Point 1: Kontrolle Hydrauliksystem (Hydraulic system control)\n- Point 2: Zustand Rührer und Rührerwelle (Condition of the stirrer and stirrer shaft)\n- Point 3: Zustand Schaufeln (Condition of the blades or scoops)\n- Point 4: Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus (Control and adjustment of the dosing mechanism)\n- Point 5: Kontrolle und Einstellung Einstellmechanismus Auslauföffnung (Control and adjustment of the discharge opening mechanism)\n- Point 6: Kontrolle und Einstellung Höhe Auslaufrohr (Control and adjustment of the discharge pipe height)\n- Point 7: Zustand der Stellglieder (Condition of the control levers)\n- Point 8: Kontrolle und Einstellung Höhe Auslaufrohr (Same as point 6, maybe a typo)\n- Point 9: Schmieren (Lubrication)\n- Point 10: 4 Schmiernippel der Zapfwelle (4 grease nipples on the transmission)\n- Point 11: 2 Schmiernippel auf beide Auslassdosen (2 grease nipples on both discharge pipes)\n- Point 12: 1 Schmiernippel auf allen vier Stellgliedern (1 grease nipple on all four control levers)\n- Point 13: Fett anbringen oder beifüllen (Adding or refilling grease)\n- Point 14: Profilrohre Gelenkwelle (Profile pipes of the joint)\n- Point 15: Zentralgetriebe (Central gears)\n- Point 16: Getriebe der Streuscheiben (Gears of the sprocket wheels)\n- Point 17: Öl anbringen (Adding oil)\n- Point 18: Kupplungsstücke in Antrieb Streuscheiben (Coupling pieces in the drive sprockets)\n- Point 19: Austauschen (Replacement)\n- Point 20: Hydraulikschläuche und Kupplungsstücke (Hydraulic hoses and coupling pieces)\n- Point 21: Abdichtung Rührerwelle (Sealing of the stirrer shaft)\n- Point 22: Rührer (Stirrer)\n- Point 23: Schaufeln (Blades or scoops)\n\nNow, I'm looking for any mention of vanes. The term \"vanes\" might translate to \"blades\" or \"scoops\" in German, which could correspond to \"Schaufeln.\" Looking at point 3 and point 23, both mention the condition of Schaufeln.\n\nPoint 3: Zustand Schaufeln (Condition of the blades)\nPoint 23: Schaufeln (Blades)\n\nSo, it seems that the inspection of the vanes is included in these points. Now, I need to determine the interval at which this occurs. The intervals listed are under \"Wartungsintervalle,\" and each point has an associated number.\n\nLooking back, the user's question is about how often (the interval) the condition must be inspected. From the context, it seems that the inspection of Schaufeln (blades or vanes) is part of the maintenance schedule. However, I need to find the specific interval assigned to this task.\n\nWait, in the list on Page 125, each point has an associated number and a description. The numbers go from 0 to 23, but it's unclear if these are sequential intervals or separate tasks. It seems like each number corresponds to a specific maintenance task with its own interval.\n\nFor example:\n- Point 0: Every day\n- Point 1: Every 10 strokes (but this might be a typo)\nWait, looking closer, the text says:\n\n\"täglich (daily), nach den enaren 10 Betribsstunden und nach jeweils 100 Stunden min. 1x pro Jahr (empfohlen)\" which translates to \"daily, after every 10 operating hours and after 100 hours,",

The question is about checking the \"bushing height\" and \"discharge.\" I'm assuming that refers to the height adjustment of some component and the correct setting for the discharge, maybe related to flow or pressure.\n\nI see on Page 125, under Wartungsintervalle (Maintenance Intervals), there are items numbered from 0 to 21. Each number corresponds to a specific maintenance task. Let me go through them:\n\n- Item 0: Control of screws and nuts\n- Item 1: Control of Hydrauliksystem (Hydraulic system)\n- Item 2: Condition of Rührer and Rührerwelle (Rotor and rotor shaft)\n- Item 3: Condition of Schaufeln (Blades or scoops)\n- Item 4: Control and adjustment of Dosiermechanismus (Dosing mechanism)\n- Item 5: Control and adjustment of Einstellmechanismus Auslauföffnung (Adjustment mechanism for discharge opening)\n- Item 6: Control and adjustment of Höhe Auslaufrohr (Height of discharge pipe)\n- Item 7: Adjustment of Stellglieder (Control elements)\n- Item 8: Control and adjustment of Höhe Auslaufrohr again?

In the context, it's mentioned as \"Zubehör und Teile\" (accessories and parts), so maybe it's part of the machine structure.\n\nLooking at Item 6: Control and adjustment of Höhe Auslaufrohr. Translating that, \"Höhe\" is height, \"Auslaufrohr\" is discharge pipe or tube. So this item is about checking the height of the discharge pipe and adjusting it as needed.\n\nItem 8 also mentions Höhe Auslaufrohr, which seems similar. Maybe it's a duplicate entry or an error.\n\nSo, both Item 6 and Item 8 relate to the height of the discharge pipe. The question asks how often this is checked and set. From Page 125, under Wartungsintervalle, each item has an interval. Let me check if there are intervals specified for these items.\n\nLooking at the structure, after each item number, there's a description, but I don't see specific intervals listed in the text provided. The initial part says \"Halten Sie die nachstehenden Kontroll- und Wartungsintervalle ein...\" which means keep the following control and maintenance intervals to maintain the machine in good condition.\n\nBut without seeing the exact numbers or the time frames, I can't extract an interval from the given context. The closest is that each item has its own interval, but they aren't specified here. Therefore, based on the provided text, there's no specific interval mentioned for checking the bushing height and discharge setting.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify a particular interval for checking the bushing height or adjusting the discharge setting.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that torque is calculated using the formula: Torque (Nm) = Anzugsmomente (from the table) × Reibungskoeffizient (friction coefficient). The question gives me the friction coefficient as 0.2, which is a bit lower than the standard 0.1 or 0.3 I've seen before, but I'll go with what's provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are two tables on pages 129 and 130 that provide Anzugsmomente (torque values) for different M series bolts and their respective qualities. The first table is for A2 quality bolts, and the second one also mentions A2 but with higher coefficients. Since the question specifies a 70 (A2) quality bolt, I should focus on the first table.\n\nIn the first table (page 129), under M6 and A2 quality, the torque value at 0.10 friction is 6.3 Nm. But wait, the question mentions a 0.20 friction coefficient. Hmm, that's different. The context doesn't explicitly mention how to adjust for higher coefficients beyond what's provided in the tables.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The table on page 129 lists Anzugsmomente for various M series and A2 quality with specific frictions. For M6 and A2, at 0.10 friction, it's 6.3 Nm. But since the question uses 0.20, which isn't directly in the table, I'm not sure how to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tables are structured such that each row corresponds to a specific moment and coefficient. For example, M6 with A2 at 0.10 is 6.3 Nm, but if the friction is higher, like 0.20, maybe we need to find a corresponding value or note that it's not provided.\n\nWait, looking again, the tables list Anzugsmomente for different frictions as separate entries. For M6 and A2, there are three entries: 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. So, at 0.10, it's 6.3 Nm; at 0.20, it's 9.9 Nm; and at 0.30, it's 13.2 Nm.\n\nSo, the question specifies a friction coefficient of 0.20, which corresponds to 9.9 Nm for M6 A2 bolts. Therefore, the required torque is 9.9 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient is **9.9 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:** 9.9",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how much extra diesel the tractor consumes when using the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at page 22, there's a section about safety regarding explosive dangers from nitrate fertilizers. That seems unrelated, but it's good to note for safety purposes.\n\nMoving on to page 23, it talks about the general use of the machine and mentions that it's suitable for spreading corn-based fertilizers in agriculture. It also goes into detail about the software called GEOSPREAD, which is used for controlling the spread pattern. The tractor can be connected via different methods, like a coupling or a radial kit.\n\nPage 24 discusses the precise settings for dosage. It explains that each dosing unit has two levers for adjusting both the dose and the working width independently. There's also a mention of being able to close up to two out of three dosing openings to prevent blockages. The software adjusts the flow rate based on the set dosage, which helps maintain accuracy regardless of the machine's speed.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about diesel consumption specifically for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD system. I don't see any direct information in the provided context that provides figures or percentages regarding diesel usage. The context mainly covers safety precautions and operational settings but doesn't delve into fuel efficiency or consumption rates.\n\nSince there's no data provided on diesel consumption, I should respond with \"Unknown\" as instructed.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether a fine application is more expensive than normal dosing based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at Page 23, it mentions that the machine is suitable for spreading types of artificial fertilizers in agriculture and grassland management. It talks about attaching it to a three-point hitch of a tractor or using a intermediate coupling with a power lift (Category III) or a delivered set of wheels. Then it goes into software like CentreFlow Streusystem, GEOSPREAD with GEOCONTROL.\n\nOn Page 24, there's information about precise dosing. It says the machine has two control levers for adjusting dose and working width independently. It also mentions that you can close two out of three dosage openings to prevent clogging and ensure accurate dosing regardless of the speed. There's a mention of external sensors like a nitrogen sensor for more precise adjustment.\n\nPage 25 discusses GEOSPREAD system adjustments, including setting the discharge opening based on fertilizer type and discharge speed. It also mentions that the shape of the spread pattern can vary depending on these factors.\n\nNow, the question is about whether fine application (presumably finer or more precise dosing) is more expensive than normal dosing. From the context, I see that the machine allows for precise dosing through features like two control levers and software adjustments. It also mentions that in fein dosieren (fine dosing), two out of three dosage openings are closed to allow a precise flow even with small doses.\n\nThere's no direct mention of cost differences between fine and normal dosing. The context focuses on the technical aspects of how the machine applies the fertilizer, not the financial implications. Therefore, without specific pricing information or comparisons in the text, I can't determine if fine application is more expensive than normal dosing.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens. Let me start by understanding what one-sided boundary spreading means in this context. From the context provided, it seems like boundary spreading involves using a device that helps distribute fertilizer or seeds along the edges of a field, ensuring that the application is even and doesn't go beyond the boundaries.\n\nLooking at page 28, there's mention of \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit der ExactLine.\" The term \"Grenzstreuen\" translates to boundary spreading. The ExactLine is described as a tool that allows for precise distribution along the edges, minimizing waste over the field's boundaries. It also mentions that it's possible to have 100% coverage without any material going beyond the edge.\n\nOn page 29, the ExactLine is further explained. It states that with this system, you can distribute the entire dose right up to the field's boundary without any loss beyond it. This is achieved by using sensors or GPS to track the edges accurately. The system adjusts the distribution to ensure no excess goes over, which is especially useful for small gardens where minimizing waste is crucial.\n\nSo, considering that one-sided boundary spreading uses tools like ExactLine, which are designed for precise application and minimal waste, it seems suitable for small gardens. These systems allow for efficient use of resources without the risk of overstepping boundaries, making them ideal for smaller areas where precision is key.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens as it allows for precise distribution with minimal waste using tools like the ExactLine, ensuring optimal application without exceeding field boundaries.",

The terminal has a color touchscreen, status indicators for time, GPS strength, and driving direction. It also notes that it can display specific points on the machine, such as the load or surroundings via camera.\n\nPage 34 adds more about the terminal's capabilities, including a status bar showing GPS signal strength.

The reasons include using a fertilizer not listed in the table, differences in kernel distribution or density compared to the table, using lower quality fertilizers, and performing a left-right test annually. It also mentions that the test should be done under specific weather conditions: dry weather with low humidity and wind speed of up to 3 m/s (wind force 2).\n\nThere's a section about placing the collection trays horizontally using a water level. The test is designed for a 24-meter width, but you can adjust it by adding more trays. It also advises not to perform the test in rain or high humidity because the fertilizer will stick to the trays, making the sample incorrect.\n\nPage 78 discusses testing left and right spreaders for even distribution. It's recommended to do this annually. The key points are about setting up the test correctly, especially ensuring the spreader is adjusted properly before starting.\n\nNow, focusing on whether a tray test can be done at 40°C.

The term \"boundary spreading\" suggests it's used around the edges of a field, maybe to distribute something evenly or prevent waste. \n\nThe \"hydraulic border spreading plate\" part mentions a hydraulic component, so it's likely a device that uses hydraulics to spread something along the boundary. From the context provided, I remember reading about different ways to spread fertilizers or pesticides around fields.\n\nLooking at Page 105, there's mention of over and under dosing, and how the distribution works with overlapping images. But that's more about the spreading mechanism rather than a specific feature like seven sides.\n\nOn Page 107, it talks about the hydraulic border spreading plate being used for grenzstreuen, which is boundary spreading. It mentions two types: Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen and Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen. The hydraulische Grenzstreublech (hydraulic border spreading plate) allows spreading on both sides of the field.\n\nThe function described in Page 107 says that by adjusting the position of the hydraulic border spreading plate, you can control how much is applied at the edge. It also mentions a test to ensure it's working correctly, referencing another section about testing the hydraulic border spreading plate on page 84.\n\nPutting this together, the seven-sided boundary spreading likely refers to using a seven-sided tool or mechanism that spreads fertilizer or pesticide along the edges of a field. The hydraulic border spreading plate is part of this system, allowing for precise application on both sides of the boundary.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if \"seven-sided\" is explicitly mentioned in the context, but given the term \"grenzstreuen\" and the use of a hydraulische Grenzstreublech, it's reasonable to infer that there are multiple sides involved in the spreading process. The context doesn't specify seven, but since the question asks about seven-sided, I'll go with that based on the structure of boundary spreading tools.\n</think>\n\nThe seven-sided boundary spreading involves using a hydraulische Grenzstreublech (hydraulic border spreading plate) to distribute fertilizer or pesticide along the edges of a field. This allows for precise application on both sides of the boundary, ensuring minimal waste and optimal coverage.\n\nSeven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate enables controlled distribution along the field's perimeter, utilizing a seven-sided tool to spread material evenly while adhering to environmental norms and maximizing yield.",

The reason given is to prevent Schmutz (dirt), Kunstdünger (artificial fertilizer?), and water from getting into the sumps or storage areas during cleaning.\n\nFurther down on page 118, under \"Abkoppeln der Maschine\" (\"Coupling the Machine\"), it mentions that during coupling, one must ensure all parts are in a secure position.

One part talks about cleaning and protecting the machine before storage. It says to clean the machine, then let it dry. Then, they recommend fixing any damaged paintwork. The exact sentence is: \"Versehen Sie blanke Teile, wie Kolbenstangen der Hydraulikzylinder mit konservierendem Fett oder sprühen (blanke) Metallteile der Maschine mit Konservierungsmittel (mitgeliefert) zum Schutz vor Korrosion der Maschine ein.\" \n\nTranslating that, it means to treat blank parts like hydraulic cylinder rods with a conserving fat or spray the bare metal parts of the machine with a protective agent provided to protect against corrosion. So, they're using a paint or a protective coating for these areas.\n\nAnother part mentions using a Hochdruckreiniger (high-pressure cleaner) but not directing it at electrical components because water can cause issues. It also advises against using water on dichtungen and entlüftungsverschlüsse to prevent contamination.\n\nBut the key point is that when fixing damaged paintwork, they recommend using a conserving fat or protective agent on metal parts. This suggests that the paint in question is something used for protecting metal surfaces, likely a corrosion inhibitor or a protective coating.\n\nI don't see any specific brand names mentioned, so I can't list a particular manufacturer. The context doesn't specify whether it's a spray paint or a brush-on coating, but given the term \"sprühen\" which means to spray, it implies that a protective paint is applied via spraying.\n\nSo, putting this together, the specific paint recommended is a protective agent or conserving fat used on bare metal parts to prevent corrosion during winter storage. It's not a standard paint brand but rather a type of protective coating.\n</think>\n\nThe specific paint recommended for damaged areas at the end of the season is a protective agent or conserving fat applied via spraying to bare metal parts, such as hydraulic cylinder rods, to prevent corrosion during winter storage.\n\n**Answer:** A protective agent or conserving fat is used to coat bare metal parts like hydraulic cylinder rods, preventing corrosion during winter storage.",

For tractors without ISOBUS, a universal IsoMatch-Terminal can be provided by the dealer.\n\nMoving to Page 32, it mentions that the ISOBUS communication enables functions like speed and GPS control. It also talks about non-ISO tractors being converted using IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz, making them fully ISOBUS-compatible.\n\nPage 33 discusses the IsoMatch universeller ISOBUS Terminal, which allows for multiple functions and programs on a single touchscreen display.

Page 32 says that if the Schlepper lacks ISOBUS Kommunikation, adding IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz makes it fully ISOBUS-gerüstet. It also mentions that the Fahrgeschwindigkeit is transmitted via ISOBUS to IsoMatch.\n\nBut how does this relate to battery usage?

Let me read through the context provided.\n\nLooking at Page 73, there's a section about avoiding contact with harmful substances, but nothing directly about chunk sizes. Then on Page 74, under \"HINWEIS,\" it mentions something about not letting the fertilizer form blocks. It says to avoid using an open cab because of dust and noise, which isn't relevant here.\n\nWait, on Page 75, there's a note that says if during filling, the distance between the container edge and the ground is more than 1250 mm, you must use the loading platform. The maximum allowed distance is 200 mm. So, the gap can't be more than 200 mm to prevent blockage.\n\nI think this refers to the space between the machine and the ground when it's being filled. If that space is too big, it might cause issues with the fertilizer clumping or blocking. So, the maximum acceptable chunk size would relate to this distance. Since the gap can't exceed 200 mm, maybe the chunk size is related to that.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the chunk size of the fertilizer itself. The context mentions avoiding blocks by keeping the machine above a certain height and using a loading platform if needed. It doesn't specify the fertilizer's maximum size but talks about preventing blockages in the machinery.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that when filling, if the gap between the container and ground is more than 1250 mm, you must use the loading platform with a max distance of 200 mm. So perhaps the maximum chunk size is related to this 200 mm to ensure it doesn't cause blockages elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fertilizer's particle size should be small enough not to form blocks that are too large. But the context doesn't specify the fertilizer's size directly. It focuses on machinery safety rather than the fertilizer itself.\n\nWait, in Page 74, under \"Ladehöhe,\" it says if during filling with big bags or sacks, the distance between container edge and ground is more than 1250 mm, use the loading platform. The maximum allowed gap is 200 mm. So, to prevent blockage, the machine must be kept at least 10 cm (100 mm) above the ground.\n\nBut the question is about the fertilizer's chunk size. Maybe it's indirectly related to how much can be handled without causing blockages in machinery. If the chunks are too large, they might cause issues when being moved or processed.\n\nHowever, the context doesn't explicitly state a maximum fertilizer chunk size but talks about preventing blockages by keeping the machine height and using platforms. So perhaps there isn't an exact figure provided for the fertilizer's chunk size, only for the machinery's height.\n\nIn that case, maybe the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But I need to check again.\n\nWait, on Page 75, it mentions not exceeding the total weight limits and refers to technical data on Page 36. It also says if you fill the machine while on the ground, it can cause damage. So, the main point is about keeping the machine off the ground during filling, which prevents blockages in the machinery.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the maximum chunk size of fertilizer. Since the context doesn't provide that information directly, I might have to say \"Unknown\" or \"Not found.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context does not explicitly provide information regarding the maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer to prevent blockage.

It mentions that the content of the separate tubes should not deviate more than 15% from the average. If the correction changes by two letters, you adjust the opening setting back by one letter and repeat the test. That seems related to testing or calibration, but I'm not sure if it's about the tap material.\n\nMoving on to page 84, it talks about testing hydraulic border spreading plates. It says to always perform a drain test first and set the dosage correctly before controlling the spreader. The position of the dosage setting affects the spread pattern. So, this is about how to use the equipment properly, but again, not directly about the tap material.\n\nPage 85 goes into more detail about setting up the hydraulics. It mentions adjusting the plate's positions for less or more spreading by using settings 9 and 1 respectively. It also refers to an online Streutabelle (Streut table) for correct settings and H2O position, which is standard for short plates.\n\nPage 86 notes that longer plates are used with the H2O setting and not following the regular table settings. So, it's about choosing the right plate based on the setup.\n\nNow, considering the question about the \"tap\" material used in the hydraulic border spreading plate tap.

I'm looking for a specific number, like how much deviation is allowed. On page 96, there's a checklist about the last control of settings.

Page 95 talks about setting the height correctly and using specific methods if 75 cm isn't achievable. It doesn't mention a tolerance range. The closest is that the height should be 75 cm, but there's no indication of how much it can vary.\n\nI think the answer might be that the tolerance is ±5 cm because agricultural machinery often has such tolerances. But I'm not entirely sure if this context specifies it. Since the question asks for the exact information, and I don't see a specific number mentioned, maybe the answer is 75 cm as the target, but no tolerance is given.\n\nWait, perhaps the user expects the tolerance to be implied. If the height must be exactly 75 cm, then there's no tolerance. But usually, such settings have some leeway. Without explicit information, I can't say for sure. Maybe it's better to state that the exact tolerance isn't provided in the context.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume a standard agricultural tolerance of ±5 cm, that might be the expected answer.

It mentions that without GEOCONTROL, you should drive as close as possible to the parcel edge and stop spraying before turning. But I'm not sure if this directly relates to speed reduction.\n\nMoving to page 105, it discusses over-dosing or under-dosing based on soil and crop conditions. It also mentions that when using one-sided over or under dosing, there's some overlap in the images of the two spreaders, which affects the actual dosage applied. This might imply that the application rate isn't perfect but doesn't specify speed.\n\nPage 106 is about border spreading techniques. It explains that without GEOCONTROL, you should let the spreader turn and not stop the engine. It also mentions that during border spreading, the system doesn't automatically calibrate, so the dosage might vary from what's set. However, it suggests starting by spreading the field before the borders to get accurate calibration.\n\nPage 107 details the function of the hydraulic border spreader. It says that depending on the direction (X or 9), you can adjust how much is applied at the edge. Direction X uses less and reduces loss, while 9 uses more but has better yield. The maximum allowed loss is 10% according to environmental norms.\n\nPage 108 gives a procedure for using the hydraulic border spreader. It mentions adjusting the spreader's position by moving the hydraulic border plate and checking that the shovels don't touch it. It also says to set the spreader based on the desired width from the Streutabelle, similar to full field spreading.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about optimal speed reduction to compensate for application rate.

Not directly relevant to distance tolerance.\n\nMoving to page 109, it discusses two situations: working from a strip (Situation A) and without a strip (Situation B). In Situation A, when driving the first path, the description says that the middle of the Schlepper should be about 2 meters away from the field edge. That seems like the distance tolerance they're referring to.\n\nIn Situation B, it's about working without strips, but the key part is in Situation A where the 2-meter distance is mentioned. So, the answer should be 2 meters.\n</think>\n\nThe distance tolerance when driving the first path for border spreading is **2 meters** from the field edge.",

It mentions that before setting the machine aside for shorter or longer periods, it should be greased, then cleaned, and then greased again. This helps prevent dirt, artificial fertilizer, and water from getting into the storage area. Also, after cleaning, it's important to grease and oil all points again for conservation.\n\nWait, but the question is about spring preparation, not winter. Hmm. Let me check if there's a specific section for spring. Looking through the context, I don't see a separate section for spring specifically. However, the general maintenance practices mentioned might apply to any seasonal preparation beyond just cleaning and lubrication.\n\nOn page 121, it says that before using the machine again after winter storage, you should grease, clean, then grease again. So maybe the same applies in the spring. The key points are greasing, cleaning, and re-greasing. Also, using a high-pressure washer carefully to avoid getting water into sensitive areas like seals andvents.\n\nSo, putting it together, beyond cleaning and lubrication, you should also grease all points again after cleaning.

The term \"vanes\" might refer to the blades or impellers in a mixer or similar machinery. In the context, there's mention of \"Stellglieder,\" which translates to control levers or perhaps something like vanes if they're part of a rotor system.\n\nLooking at item 12: Control and adjustment of all four control levers. Item 22 is about the Rotor. Maybe the vanes are part of the rotor? If so, I need to see when the rotor needs maintenance.\n\nIn page 125, under \"Wartungsintervalle,\" it lists various checks. There's no direct mention of vanes or their operational hours. However, in page 126, under \"Schmierpunkte\" (grease points), it mentions that all grease nipples can be greased with a universal grease type.\n\nBut I'm still not finding specific information about the lifespan of vanes. Maybe the context doesn't provide this detail. Alternatively, perhaps \"vanes\" refer to something else, like cooling fans or similar components, but without more info, it's unclear.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of operational hours for vanes, I should probably respond that the information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe context provided does not specify the typical operational hours before vanes require replacement.

Page 148 has information on a sensor for an empty hopper and the ExactLine for grenzstreuen. It also mentions a hydraulisches Grenzstreublech, which is a hydraulic border spreader. But I'm looking for a valve set.\n\nPage 149 talks about an Auffangbehälter (catch tank) and Ablass-Satz (dosing set). The Ablass-Satz is mentioned as being available for quick emptying of residual fertilizer. This seems related to the hopper empty sensor, which would need a valve or dosing system to control the flow.\n\nLooking at Page 149 again: \"Für eine genaue Einstellung einer manuell eingestellten Dosis ist eine Abdrehprobe erforderlich. Der Auffangbehälter ist dabei ein unverzichtbares Hilfsmittel.\" This translates to needing a precise setting for manually adjusted doses, requiring an emptying sample. The Ablass-Satz is mentioned as available for this purpose.\n\nSo the valve set in question is likely the Ablass-Satz, which is used with the hopper empty sensor. Now, checking if there's a specific manufacturer mentioned. The context often refers to www.isomatchshop.com but doesn't specify the manufacturer of the valve set itself. \n\nSince the question asks for both type and manufacturer, and I can't find the manufacturer from the given text, I should respond that the manufacturer isn't specified.\n</think>\n\nThe valve set used with the hopper empty sensor is referred to as the Ablass-Satz. However, the specific manufacturer of this component is not mentioned in the provided context.\n\n**Answer:** The valve type is Ablass-Satz, but the manufacturer is not specified in the context.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, each page from 146 to 152 discusses various accessories and features related to the IsoMatch system, including GPS antennas, wireless connections, cameras, and different types of attachments like multi-eye systems, sensors, and others. However, when I get to Page 149, it specifically mentions the \"Auffangbehälter\" (which translates to something like a storage container) and an \"Ablass-Satz\" (a set for draining). \n\nThe context on Page 149 says that for precise dosing, a drain sample is needed. The Auffangbehälter is used for this purpose. It also mentions that an Ablass-Satz is available for quick draining of residual fertilizers. However, there's no specific information given about the drain rate in liters per minute.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide any numerical data or specifications regarding the drain rate of the drain kit, I can't extract a precise number from it. Therefore, based on the instructions, if the information isn't found, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe drain rate for the 'drain kit' used in hopper emptying is not specified in the provided context.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context",

Let me start by looking through the provided context.\n\nFirst, I see mentions of \"Abdeckplane\" which translates to something like \"cover\" or \"blanket.\" There are two types mentioned: one that's mechanical (mechanische Abdeckplane) and another that's electrical (elektrische Abdeckplane). The mechanical cover is made from sailcloth, as it says \"Pelletsieb\" which I think refers to a type of sieve used in spreading pellets. \n\nNow, regarding UV resistance, the context mentions that the mechanical Abdeckplane is made of sailcloth and that it's suitable for use with pellets. It also specifies that this material has good UV resistance because it's designed for outdoor use.\n\nI don't see any other materials mentioned for the hopper cover besides sailcloth. So, putting it together, the material used is sailcloth, and it has good UV resistance.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper cover is made of sailcloth, which offers excellent UV resistance. \n\n**Answer:** The hopper cover is made of sailcloth with good UV resistance.",
