In doing so, the control system corrects changes in driving speed, while maintaining the option to adjust the application rate manually for over- or underdosing.\nThe control system can search for the correct dosing setting with the preset application rate through automatic calibration. The disadvantage is that the application rate for the second automatic calibration (= approx. 2 minutes) could differ markedly from the selected application rate. It is therefore strongly recommended that the starting values be taken from the spreading charts. This can be done in the 'Curve Calibration' screen. The control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.\n See also paragraph »The ISO control system« on page 30.\nLook for the most comparable fertiliser type and the correct settings for the selected working width in the (online) spreading chart:\n Read the setting of the dosing in the Dosing Setting column that goes with the selected application rate and driving speed.\n The corresponding flowrate is given in the Kg/min column.\n The given values are to be entered in the control system.\nIf the selected application rate is not given",

The ExactLine is available in a right and a left version.\nA trapezoidal spreading pattern may result, depending on the type of fertiliser, working width and application rate.\n\nThe ExactLine has an overlapping area of less than 100%.\nReducing working width during the pass\nThe control of discharge point and dosing via the 4 actuators enables the calculation of a variable working width. By means of this, the working width can be varied at an angle on the headlands (gored spreading) or an incomplete final pass without interrupting the spreading for this purpose.\nThe spray computer can determine the time of full or partial closure with the GPS and the data of the sprayed passes. This takes place on the headland and during gored spreading. The quantity of over or under fertilisation is substantially reduced by this.\n81\n===Page 82===\n\nGetting familiar with the machine\n[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\nThe ExactLine system can be used for border spreading from the sprayer tramline.\nA ExactLine is available in a right and a left version.\nSelecting the pattern for border spreading\nIt is not possible to completely cover the field border at the application rate and not have anything go beyond the border. Current environmental standards only allow for minimal loss over the field edge.\nExactLine bends the fertiliser granules in such a way that loss over the edge of the border is restricted to the bare minimum and it provides as full a spreading pattern as possible.\nThe ExactLine has 'environment' and 'yield' settings for precisely adjusting border spreading.\n[Image]\n83\n===Page 84===\n\nGetting familiar with the machine\nBorder track spreading with ExactLine\nIt is possible to spread right up to the border (boundary track spreading) from the first sprayer tramline with ExactLine.\nA ExactLine bends the fertiliser granules in such a way that loss over the edge of the border is restricted to the bare minimum and it provides as full a spreading pattern as possible.\nExactLine has 'environment' and 'yield' settings for precisely adjusting border spreading.\n[Image]\n85\n===Page 86===\n\nGetting familiar with the machine\nThe ISO control system\nThe automatic weighing system\nThe ISO control system uses the ISOBUS communication protocol, which makes it suitable for tractors that are also equipped with an ISOBUS communication system. For tractors that still do not have an ISOBUS connection, your dealer can supply the universal IsoMatch terminal to which you can connect all ISOBUS machines.\nThe spreader uses weighcells to continuously measure the quantity of fertiliser that is being spread. The computer in the distribution box compares these values with the set application rate and corrects as needed by further opening or closing the dosing unit. The tractor's electronics or an extra (gps) sensor measures the current required driving speed and localisation.\nThe working width and the start/stop time is controlled with field boundaries and headlands. Field data imported from a new management system or a newly created field boundary is used for this purpose.\n[Image]\n86\n===Page 87===\n\nflowrate (kg/min)\n[Image]\nINDICATION\nDosing setting\nGetting familiar with the machine\nThe computer calculates the required fertiliser flowrate with the following formula:\nFlowrate required = (kg/min)\nWorking width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)\n600\nAutomatic Calibration test\nWith the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute, the computer determines what dosing setting corresponds with what flowrate. This relation is different for each fertiliser type, after all.\nA shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields.\nThe control system calculates the discharge curve from the starting values. The control system corrects the spreader for changing circumstances, based on this curve, e.g. as a result of changes in driving speed.\nThe computer needs at least 1 measuring point to determine the relation between dosing setting and flowrate. This value comes from the spreading chart. By means of the automatic calibration tests, the computer repeatedly corrects the relation between flowrate and dosing setting. In this way, the relation is always current and the spreader reacts in the right way to changes, for example, in driving speed or in cases of over and under dosing.\nTo prevent field conditions such as slopes and holes",
