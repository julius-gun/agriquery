The distance between the inner side of the string and the opening of the sealing ring should be 109 mm.\n[Step-by-step procedure from the context]\n1. Place the machine on solid supports resting on a robust surface.\n2. First perform the controls described in \"Control and Adjustment of the Flow Control Mechanism\" page 133.\n3. Disconnect the system command electronics, cut off the tractor engine, remove the key, and tighten the handbrake.\n4. Indicate the empty hopper position at the terminal.\n5. Successively press the start and stop buttons to activate the correct position.\n6. After disconnecting the system command electronics, cutting off the tractor engine, and removing the key, check again if a small gap appears between the spreading discs.\n7. If necessary, adjust the flow control point on the electric cylinder until a small gap appears between the spreading discs.\n8. Raise the string as shown in the illustration.\n9. Respect scrupulously the distance between the inner side of the string and the opening of the sealing ring.\n10. If the measured distance is greater than or less than 109 mm, proceed as follows:\n    - Loosen slightly the two bolts on the flow control cylinder plate.\n    - Move the electric cylinder plate until the distance between the inner side of the string and the opening of the sealing ring is 109 mm.\n    - Retighten the two bolts without moving the electric cylinder plate again.\n    - Also check for the other side.\n    - Fix the dashboard by tightening the three fixing screws.",
