It mentions \"Feindosierung,\" which translates to \"fine application.\" The relevant part says that for fine dosing, the Streuer (dosing system) is standardly equipped with a Feindosierung, which involves setting a Hebel (a lever). \n\nIn this setup, during fine application, 2 out of the 3 dosieröffnungen are closed. This closure ensures precise and reliable flow even when dealing with very small doses. The reason given is to avoid blockages and ensure consistent dosing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the exact number of dosing openings closed during fine application is two.\n</think>\n\n2",

It mentions that the dosage is variable and controlled by an external signal. It also talks about using the IsoMatch PRO Terminal requiring a specific license key. But I'm not sure if this directly relates to the overlap percentage.\n\nMoving on to Page 28, it discusses the machine's spreading patterns. The first part says that when applying a flat map (Flächendüngung), the spread pattern is fully overlapped, meaning it's 100% overlapped. That seems relevant because the question is about the full field spreading pattern.\n\nFurther down on Page 28, under \"Streubildformen\" (spread forms), it mentions that for most types of fertilizers, you can expect a triangular spread with complete overlap on average working width. This also supports the idea that the full field spread overlaps completely.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the context. The key point is that during flat map application, there's 100% overlap. So the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is 100%.\n</think>\n\nThe overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is **100%**.",

It mentions that there are left and right versions available. Then, on page 30, it discusses the ISOBediensystem, which uses ISOBUS communication. It also mentions an automatic weighing system where the Streuer measures the amount of fertilizer being spread by continuously monitoring through weight cells. The computer compares this with the set dosage and adjusts accordingly.\n\nPage 31 talks about the required outflow speed calculation based on factors like working width, speed, and application rate. There's also mention of automatic checks every 75 kg or minute to determine the correct dosage and speed setting for each fertilizer type. For smaller plots, shorter intervals can be set.\n\nSo, focusing on the question: What system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread? The key part is that the Streuer (which I think refers to the spreader) uses a weighing system. It's an automatic system that measures the amount by weight and adjusts the dosage as needed. This happens in real-time through the computer, which uses data from the weigh cells.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only extracting the specific info related to the question.

The text mentions that if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication, it can still be connected to IsoMatch using a specific Stromversorgungskabelsatz (power supply cable set). This setup allows the tractor to become fully ISOBUS-equipped, enabling communication with the IsoMatch Bedienpult (operator panel).\n\nSo, even without ISOBUS initially, adding this cable set bridges the gap. The speed of the tractor is then transmitted via ISOBUS through IsoMatch. The standard cable 'IM Tellus input' can be used for other connections as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer should explain that a Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to enable ISOBUS communication on the tractor, allowing the driving speed to be sent to IsoMatch.\n</think>\n\nTo transmit the tractor's driving speed to IsoMatch without ISOBUS communication, use the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz.

Then it goes into setting up the IsoMatch control panel or other separate ISO control panels by first installing the appropriate holder.\n\nNext, it says that mounting materials and installation instructions come with the operator unit. Additionally, there's a brief installation guide provided. \n\nWhen using IsoMatch or another separate ISO control panel on a sleiper equipped with an ISOBUS communication system, you can connect it using a 7-pin CAN cable to a standard CAN connection on the sleiper. It then describes how to attach the cable at specific connectors.\n\nIf the sleiper isn't equipped with ISOBUS, you need a sleiper ECU, which your dealer can provide. This ECU has a 9-pin CAN connector that needs to be connected to the operator unit.\n\nMoving on to page 40, it talks about console installation before first use. It mentions mounting the console at a location that's visible, easy to operate while driving, and minimizes visibility loss and hindrance when operating the sleiper. The console has height and angle adjustments for optimal viewing.\n\nThe steps include using provided fixing materials to attach the console to the back of the operator panel.

The instructions specify that you should apply grease to the contact surfaces of the two profile pipes as soon as you notice that the joint halves aren't moving smoothly in or out. This needs to be done at least once per season, though.\n\nFurther down on page 127, it discusses the central transmission, which has two chambers filled with specific grease called EP 00/000.

The text also talks about removing dirt, artificial fertilizer, or old grease and refilling the transmission with new grease until it's almost touching the fill and seal caps.\n\nThen there's a section about the grease under the sprocket plates (Streuscheiben). It says that the grease level must be 35 mm below the filler opening when measured after the machine has stood still for some time. The steps involve removing any dirt, opening the transmission to check the grease level, measuring it, adding more if needed until the desired level is reached, and then closing it again.\n\nSo, focusing on the question: What's the required grease level in mm below the filler opening for spreading disc gearboxes after the machine has stood still?

Let me go through the text carefully.\n\nLooking at page 67, there's a section about \"Feindosieren,\" which translates to \"Fine application.\" It mentions a \"Feindosierhebel\" or Fine application handle. There's an image mentioned with three round openings: one open and two closed. The text says that this setup is for fine dosing.\n\nThe instructions on using the Feindosierhebel involve setting it so that the arrow on the hand grip points to the desired position, which I think corresponds to the number of open dosing holes.

The text refers to a specific symbol, probably an icon or indicator that shows when the fine application feature is active. It's likely a pictogram or a specific mark on the handle.\n\nThe context doesn't explicitly name the symbol but describes its function: it indicates the fine dosing setting.

The ECO section says that for work along waterways, the loss beyond the field edge is equal to or less than what the norm allows, and thus should be used.\n\nNow, looking at the procedure on page 111, it talks about setting up the ExactLine in working position using a simple hydraulic control for a few seconds.

The user is asking about when they can't lower the power lift far enough. In the context, there's a tip that says if the machine isn't able to lower the power lift far enough, they should place the Streuer (probably a part of the machine) on a stable elevation, like a palette. Then, follow steps such as moving the machine forward, shutting it down, securing it with stabilizing legs, unplugging electrical connectors, draining hydraulics, etc.\n\nSo, putting that together, if you can't lower the power lift enough, you should place the Streuer on a stable platform and then proceed with the other storage preparation steps.

On Page 125, under \"Wartungsintervalle\" which translates to \"Maintenance Intervals,\" there's a list of maintenance tasks with numbers. Each number corresponds to a specific task.\n\nI'm looking for any mention of vanes or their condition in these intervals. Scanning through the list:\n\n- Item 0: Kontrollieren (Control)\n- Item 1: »Kontrolle von Schrauben und Muttern« (Control of screws and nuts)\n- Item 2: »Kontrolle Hydrauliksystem« (Hydraulic system control)\n- Item 3: Zustand Rührer und Rührerwelle (Condition of stirrer and stirrer shaft)\n- Item 4: Zustand Schaufeln (Condition of scoops)\n- Item 5: »Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus« (Control and adjustment of dosing mechanism)\n- Item 6: »Kontrolle und Einstellung Einstellmechanismus Auslauföff- nung« (Control and adjustment of discharge opening mechanism)\n- Item 7: »Kontrolle und Einstellung Höhe Auslaufrohr« (Control and adjustment of discharge pipe height)\n- Items 8 to 23: Various tasks like Schmieren (greasing), Austauschen (replacing), etc.\n\nI don't see any specific mention of vanes here. Vanes are part of the machine's components, but in this context, they might be referred to differently. Maybe \"vanes\" are called something else, like \"blades\" or \"impellers.\" Let me check if there's another section that talks about them.\n\nLooking back at Page 124, it starts with \"Abfallstoffe sammeln und entsorgen,\" which is about collecting and disposing waste materials. Then there's a table listing specific parts with their quantities and specifications, like Getriebefett EP00/000 and various oils. This seems more related to lubrication and waste management rather than maintenance intervals for vanes.\n\nSince the question is about the inspection interval of vanes, and I don't find any direct reference to them in the provided context, especially under \"Wartungsintervalle,\" I might need to consider if they're mentioned elsewhere. However, based on the given information, there's no specific interval provided for vanes.\n\nTherefore, without explicit data about when to inspect vanes, the answer should be that the information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe condition of the vanes is not explicitly addressed in the provided context, so the required information is not available.\n\nAnswer: Not found in context.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section labeled \"Wartungsintervalle,\" which translates to \"Maintenance Intervals.\" This seems relevant because it likely outlines the regular maintenance procedures for the machine parts, including the bushing height and discharge setting.\n\nWithin this section, I see a list of numbers with corresponding tasks. Each number probably corresponds to an interval or step in the maintenance process. Let me go through each point:\n\n- 0: Kontrollieren (Control)\n- 1: Control of screws and nuts\n- 2: Hydrauliksystem control (Hydraulic system control)\n- 3: Condition of stirrer and stirrer shaft\n- 4: Condition of scoops\n- 5: Control and adjustment of dosing mechanism\n- 6: Control and adjustment of outlet elevation mechanism\n- 7: Adjustment of discharge setting\n\nWait, point 7 says \"»Kontrolle und Einstellung Höhe Auslaufrohr«\" which translates to \"Control and adjustment of discharge height.\" But the question is about checking the bushing height and adjusting the discharge. I need to see if there's a specific reference to the bushing height.\n\nLooking further, point 4 mentions \"Zustand Schaufeln,\" which is about the condition of scoops, but that doesn't directly relate to the bushing. Point 7 seems to be about the discharge height adjustment, not the bushing itself.\n\nI don't see a specific entry for the bushing height in this list. The closest related task is point 4 (scoops) and point 7 (discharge height). Since there's no direct mention of the bushing height, I might need to infer based on standard maintenance practices or look elsewhere in the context.\n\nLooking back at the initial part about Abfallstoffe (waste materials), it mentions collecting and disposing of waste from machine maintenance. That doesn't help with the specific question.\n\nIn the Wartungsintervalle section, each number corresponds to a task. Since there's no explicit mention of bushing height, I might have to conclude that the information isn't provided in the context or that it's not part of the standard maintenance intervals listed here.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there's no specific interval provided for checking the bushing height and adjusting the discharge setting. The closest related task is point 7 about discharge height adjustment, but without a specific interval mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the interval for checking the bushing height or adjusting the discharge setting.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Maybe it's on another page or not listed here. Let me check Page 125 as well.\n\nPage 125 seems to be a continuation of maintenance measures. It lists items from 9 onwards:\n- Point 9: Greasing of coupling parts.\n- Point 10: Grease the bearing housing of the transmission.\n- Point 11: Grease the bellows on both discharge pipes.\n- Point 12: Grease all four control levers.\n- Point 13: Adding or refilling grease.\n- Point 14: Grease the joint of the coupling rod.\n- Point 15: Greasing of central gears.\n- Point 16: Greasing of gear teeth on mixing paddles.\n- Point 17: Adding oil to the tank.\n- Point 18: Grease coupling parts in the mixing gear.\n- Point 19: Replace gaskets.\n- Point 20: Replace hydraulic hoses and couplings.\n- Point 21: Check and tighten the seal on the mixing shaft.\n- Point 22: Condition of the mixing shaft.\n- Point 23: Condition of paddles.\n\nWait, point 21 says \"Abdichtung Rührerwelle,\" which translates to \"seal of the mixing shaft.\" So that's about the agitator seal. It mentions checking and tightening the seal. But does it specify when to replace it?\n\nLooking at the context again, I don't see any specific interval given for replacement. The context only mentions checking and tightening, not replacing. There's no mention of a frequency or time period for replacement.\n\nSo, based on this, there's information about inspecting the seal but no specific interval provided for replacement. Therefore, the answer should state that the replacement interval isn't specified in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the replacement interval for the agitator seal.

The first number is 90 Nm? But wait, the context says that 0.10 is for lubricated and 0.13 for dry. So does this mean that for M18 with 0.13 friction, it's 90 Nm?\n\nBut let me double-check. The table seems to have two values per screw size: one for 0.10 and another for 0.13. For example, M5 has 1,7 and then 2, which might correspond to the two different friction coefficients.\n\nLooking at the structure:\n\nEach row starts with a number (like 0,1,2,...), followed by M size, then two sets of numbers separated by commas. The first set is probably for 0.10, and the second for 0.13.\n\nSo in the M18 row: 90,110,250,290,350,420,410,490\n\nWait, that's eight numbers after M18. Maybe it's two sets of four? Or perhaps each pair corresponds to different parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first number is torque for 0.10, and the next is for 0.13. But in this case, it's 90 and then 110, which doesn't make sense because 0.13 should be higher than 0.10.\n\nWait, no, the context says that 0.13 is higher, so the torque would be higher when using 0.13 compared to 0.10.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nFor M18, the first number after M18 is 90, then 110, which might not align with this logic. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row has two sets of numbers: one for 0.10 and another for 0.13. For example, in the M5 row: 1,7 and 2. So maybe for M18, it's 90 (for 0.10) and 110 (for 0.13). But that doesn't fit because",

However, in the table, it seems like each row's numbers are already considering a specific friction coefficient. For example, M6 has 3 Nm, which might be based on a standard friction value.\n\nBut the question specifies a 0.2 friction coefficient. I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because the table doesn't explicitly mention adjusting for different coefficients. It seems like each entry in the table is predefined for specific materials and conditions.\n\nSince the M6 row has 3 Nm, and there's no indication that this value changes with a higher friction coefficient in the context provided, I think the answer is 3 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten the M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt under the given conditions is **3 Nm**. \n\nAnswer:  \n3",

It also says that you can close 2 out of 3 dosing openings to reduce the risk of blockage while maintaining the desired dosage even at lower discharge speeds.\n\nThere's a section on precise dosing where it mentions that each plate has three openings for normal dosing, allowing accurate dosing over a wide range. For fine dosing, there's a separate mechanism with a lever that can be adjusted to close two of the three openings. This setup is meant to allow precise control even for small doses without clogging.\n\nThe question is asking if fine application (presumably fine dosing) is more expensive than normal dosing.

Let me start by understanding what one-sided boundary spreading means in this context.\n\nLooking at the context provided, specifically Page 28, there's a section about \"Streubildformen\" which translates to \"Forms of Distribution.\" It mentions that during field application (Flächendüngung), the distribution pattern becomes 100% overlapped. The typical shape expected is a triangular distribution with full overlap on average working width.\n\nFurther down, it talks about the GEOSPREAD function and how using a boundary spreader or hydraulic boundary spreader allows for one-sided spreading along parcel boundaries. This helps in optimizing the application to reduce environmental impact by limiting the area covered beyond what's necessary.\n\nThe context also mentions that with reduced working widths during specific operations, the distribution shape transitions from trapezoidal to triangular with full overlap. This suggests that the system can adjust the spread pattern based on the equipment used and the specific task control settings.\n\nNow, considering small gardens, one-sided boundary spreading would be beneficial because it allows precise application right up to the edges without unnecessary spreading beyond the garden's boundaries. This method reduces waste and ensures efficient use of inputs, which is especially important for smaller areas where resources might be more limited.\n\nI don't see any information that contradicts this conclusion within the provided context. The focus seems to be on optimizing distribution and reducing environmental impact, which aligns with the suitability of one-sided spreading for small gardens.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens as it allows precise application right up to the edges without unnecessary spreading beyond the garden's boundaries, ensuring efficient use of inputs.",

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nThe context starts with some technical terms about machinery parts like Strom and Düngemittelkörnern, which I think are related to electrical components and fertilizer particles. Then it mentions something about a Grenzstreublech, which might be a border or edge device. There's also mention of different working widths, Situation A and B.\n\nIt then talks about an image and a tip: \"Give GEOCONTROL that the boundary of the plot is on the right side of the machine when spreading the previous part.\" That seems like a setup for the machine to recognize where it should stop.\n\nMoving on, Page 100 details how to start spreading fertilizer. It involves closing the cab, moving the first furrow based on the pattern, engaging the control panel, setting up the parcel number without GEOCONTROL, starting the engine, adjusting the disc speed according to a table, not letting the discs spin unnecessarily to avoid overgrinding the fertilizer, then starting the drive and opening dosers by pressing a button.\n\nIt also mentions that the speed can be adjusted by changing gears but keeping the motor speed constant. Then it goes into how GEOCONTROL works when passing the previous part's boundary, automatically adjusting the spread width based on overlap settings. It says that if the screen 'TC Implement Settings' has an offset set, GEOCONTROL will switch the discs when reaching the boundary, provided there's enough overlap and they're turning at the right point.\n\nThere's a note about the usual setting being 50% overlap. Also, the overlap on the parcel boundary can be adjusted in GEOCONTROL. If you don't want to go over the boundary, set it to 0.\n\nNow, the question is how to stop spreading fertilizer. From the context, stopping would involve shutting down the machine or adjusting settings so that the discs stop working.\n\nLooking through the steps, after starting the drive and opening dosers, if I want to stop, I might need to disengage the discs. The context doesn't explicitly say how to stop them, but it does mention not to let them spin unnecessarily. So perhaps stopping involves shutting off the engine or disengaging the motor.\n\nAlternatively, since GEOCONTROL manages the discs based on boundaries, maybe you can stop by reaching the boundary and letting GEOCONTROL handle the rest, but that might not fully stop the spreading unless you physically stop the machine.\n\nI think the most precise answer is to shut down the machine's engine, which would stop all operations, including fertilizer spreading.\n</think>\n\nTo stop spreading fertilizer, one should shut down the machine's engine.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context is in German, but I can understand some technical terms. It talks about different methods of spreading fertilizer on a field, specifically mentioning \"Grenzstreuen\" which I think means border or edge spreading. There are two situations mentioned: Situation A and Situation B, involving ExactLine and Grenzabstreuen.\n\nLooking at Page 102, it describes the Vorgewendefunktion (headland function) of GEOCONTROL. It mentions that during Vorgewende (headland), they use either Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen or Grenzabstreuen. For ExactLine and Situation A, they start with Parzellengrenze, then do a second Umlauf without ExactLine, and fill the parcel with Schleifen over their spritzgassen.\n\nOn Page 103, it talks about using the hydraulische Grenzstreublech for Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen. It also mentions that without GEOCONTROL, you stop the spreading when you're half a working width away from the parcel edge. Then, they let the Streuscheiben rotate without shutting off the hydraulic system. After rotating, they open the Dosiereinheiten again and continue spreading until the end of the parcel edges.\n\nThe question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies without using GEOCONTROL. From Page 103, when not using GEOCONTROL, after stopping the spread near the edge, they let the Streuscheiben rotate. This likely means that the fertilizer continues to fly for some distance beyond the edge before falling back down. The exact height isn't specified numerically, but it's implied that without GEOCONTROL, the spread is done in a way that allows the fertilizer to fly further, hence higher.\n\nSo, putting this together, when not using GEOCONTROL, the fertilizer can fly up to half a working width beyond the edge before stopping, which would mean the height isn't specified directly but implies it's sufficient for the spread without control.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum height the fertilizer flies without GEOCONTROL is not explicitly stated in the context. However, it implies that the fertilizer can fly sufficiently far beyond the edge of the parcel when the Dosiereinheiten are opened again after rotating the Streuscheiben.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

The function is described as using a hydraulischer Grenzstreublech, which adjusts the width of the spread around the field's edge. It mentions two directions: one where less material is applied near the edge (direction X) and another where more is applied (direction 9). The maximum allowed loss is 10% according to environmental norms.\n\nThe question refers to a seven-sided boundary, but in the context, only two types are mentioned—Einscheiben and Zweischeiben. There's no mention of a seven-sided option. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no direct reference to a seven-sided method or component.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The first thing that stands out is the mention of \"Die Profilrohre sollen einander so weit wie möglich überlappen\" which translates to \"The profiled tubes should overlap as much as possible.\" This suggests that overlapping is important for their function.\n\nFurther down, there's a step where it says \"Die Profilrohre müssen an den Enden jedoch über mindestens 25 mm Spiel verfügen,\" meaning the profiled tubes need at least 25mm of play at the ends. Then, it mentions \"Die beide Profilrohre so kürzen, dass noch ein Spiel von 25 mm bleibt,\" which translates to shortening both profiled tubes so that there's still a 25mm gap.\n\nAnother step is \"Die beiden Rohrenden entgraten,\" which I think refers to removing burrs or rough edges from the ends of the tubes. Then, \"Die Gelenkwelle reinigen\" means cleaning the coupling shaft.\n\nThere's also a mention of \"Die Schutzrohre um den gleichen Betrag kürzen,\" so the protective sleeves are being shortened by the same amount as the profiled tubes. After that, \"Die Gelenkwellenhälften ineinander schieben\" implies pushing the halves of the coupling shaft together.\n\nThe context then goes on to talk about attaching the coupling shaft to both the machine and the winch (Schlepper), setting the machine on a support stand, and ensuring safety measures like disconnecting the motor and removing the ignition key. It also mentions checking the overlap and angle of the coupling shaft, adjusting it if necessary.\n\nHowever, I'm specifically looking for information about the grease type recommended for these profiled tubes.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context provided is in German, but I can understand some technical terms. The first part mentions moving a coupling piece and securing safety chains at both ends of the protective tubes of the joint. It also talks about attaching chains with one end to a fixed point on the winch or machine. \n\nThen it discusses the need for enough space when lifting or lowering the equipment, ensuring the joint can be easily inserted and withdrawn, and that there's sufficient overlap between the profile pipes at the maximum angle of 30 degrees above and below. It also mentions that if the working angle is larger than this, damage occurs to the joint.\n\nNext, it talks about connecting hydraulic hoses, checking and cleaning hydraulic quick couplings, attaching chains properly, and controlling the hydraulic system. Then there's a section on electrical connectors, ensuring they're correctly connected without causing damage, using the right power source, not smoking (which I think is a safety reminder), checking connectors for dirt, and connecting specific parts like the ISOBUS communication connector.\n\nNow, focusing on \"hose coupling support.\" In technical terms, this likely refers to a component that supports or holds hydraulic hoses and their couplings. From the context, when they mention moving a coupling piece and securing chains at the ends of protective tubes, it seems like these are structural components that hold the joint in place.\n\nThe part about ensuring enough space for the joint when lifting suggests that the support is part of the structure that allows movement without causing wear or damage. The maximum angle allowed (30 degrees) implies that the support must be robust enough to handle that movement.\n\nSo, putting it together, the hose coupling support would be a structural component made from materials that can withstand mechanical stress and provide the necessary support for the joint's movement.

The context is in German, but since the question and answer are in English, I can focus on the relevant parts that mention blockage prevention.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about working with fertilizer. It says that most types of fertilizer absorb water and can form large blocks. These blocks can cause blockages or mess up the spreading process. \n\nThere are some tips given:\n1. Work with damp weather using a well-sealed cover.\n2. Don't spread without a cover when it's damp.\n3. Don't leave fertilizer in the spreader for long because moisture in the air can also form blocks.\n\nAdditionally, it mentions that after adjusting the spreader, you should fill it up to a certain level. It says if during filling, whether manually or with large bags, the distance between the container edge and the ground is more than 1250 mm, you need to use the loading platform. The height is specified in \"Technical data\" on page 36.\n\nFurther down, there's a list of steps when refilling the machine:\n- Use the loading platform if the distance between the machine and the platform exceeds 200 mm.\n- Make sure the machine isn't sitting on the ground but at least 10 cm high.\n- Check and close the dosing units if necessary.\n- Turn off the electronic control system.\n- Disconnect the conveyor belt, remove the ignition key from the ignition lock.\n- Engage the parking brake.\n- Close all cabin doors and windows.\n- Place undercarriage supports in front of the wheels.\n- Adjust the loading platform so that the distance between it and the spreader is no more than 200 mm.\n- Remove the cover.\n- Check if the sieves are closed and locked.\n- Fill the machine using appropriate aids up to the desired level, ensuring both halves are filled equally so they empty at about the same time.\n\nThe key part here is the mention of the maximum distance between the machine and the loading platform being 200 mm. This likely refers to the acceptable chunk size because if it's more than that, you need to use the platform to prevent blockages.\n\nSo, putting this together, the maximum acceptable chunk size is 200 mm.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer to prevent blockage is **200 mm**.",

One of these is about wind speed: \"Ist die Windgeschwindigkeit nicht zu hoch?\" which means \"Is the wind speed not too high?\"\n\nThe next part says, \"Fahren Sie mit der richtigen Fahrgeschwindigkeit?\" meaning \"Drive at the correct speed.\" But that's about driving speed, not wind speed.\n\nWait, but earlier on page 95, there's a section about Höhenkorrektur bei Spätdüngung, which is about height correction for late fertilization. It mentions using the high stance of the undercarriage bolts if the required height isn't possible with the hub equipment.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 105, it talks about over-dosing or under-dosing depending on soil and crop conditions. It mentions that when using one-sided over or under dosing, the actual dosage applied might differ from what's set because the spreaders overlap. This is especially noticeable in smaller working widths. So, if you're doing a single pass, the overlapping causes some areas to get more and others less.\n\nPage 106 discusses border spreading specifically. It mentions two methods: Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen (single disc border spreading) with a hydraulic border spreader and Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen (two-disc border spreading) with ExactLine. When doing border spreading, the idea is to apply fertilizer evenly along the edges without losing too much over the field edge.\n\nThe key point here is that when you're doing border spreading, especially with single discs, the dosage might not be as precise because the bedienungssystem (control system) doesn't automatically adjust during the border spreading. So, if you set a certain dosage, it might not apply exactly as intended due to overlaps or other factors.\n\nThe question is about the optimal speed reduction percentage needed to compensate for this application rate. From page 105, when doing one-sided over or under dosing, the effective dosage can be less than what's set because of overlapping. So, if you reduce your driving speed, the spreader covers a smaller area with each pass, which might help in applying the correct dosage without too much overlap.\n\nBut wait, the context doesn't specify the exact percentage reduction needed. It just mentions that overlaps occur and that the dosage can vary. So, I don't have specific numbers here.

It mentions using grease (Fett) and specifically refers to EP 00/000 grease. This seems relevant because connectors often involve joints or connections that can benefit from lubrication to prevent corrosion.\n\nMoving on to page 128, it discusses oil application for coupling parts. It says that standard chain oils should be used on the driveshaft and coupling components. However, this is more about the general oiling rather than specific connectors.\n\nWait, but earlier in page 127, they talk about EP 00/000 grease being used in the central gear train. Connectors might not necessarily use the same as the drive shaft or gears. I need to make sure if this applies to connectors specifically.\n\nThe context doesn't explicitly mention connectors but talks about various parts like profile sleeves, driveshafts, and couplings. Since connectors often involve metal parts that can rust, using a grease like EP 00/000 makes sense because it's designed for reducing friction and protecting against wear and corrosion.\n\nI should check if there are any other types of lubricants mentioned. On page 129, it mentions steel connector moments and some guidelines, but nothing specific about the lubricant type. So, the only relevant information is on page 127 where EP 00/000 grease is used in the central gear train, which might be applicable to connectors as well.\n\nTherefore, the suitable lubricant recommended is EP 00/000 grease.\n</think>\n\nThe suitable lubricant recommended for connectors to prevent corrosion is **EP 00/000 grease**.",

It mentions lowering pressure in hydraulic systems and switching off the electronic control system, removing keys, and engaging the parking brake. Again, not about the screwdriver.\n\nFurther down, it talks about disconnecting the machine, removing couplings with appropriate tools, draining oil from cylinders and hoses, installing new hoses to avoid kinks, and disposing of oil according to regulations. Still nothing about adjusting the dosing mechanism.\n\nThen there's a note about operating hydraulic control units after an exchange, mentioning that there's still air in the lines. It says to open and close the hydraulic control units several times before starting work. This seems related because it involves handling components connected to the dosing mechanism, but it doesn't specify the screwdriver type.\n\nLooking through the context again, I don't see any mention of tools like screwdrivers being used for adjusting the dosing mechanism specifically.

The user wants to know the exact measurement of the small gap that's visible when the dosing baffles are closed.\n\nLooking at page 135, there's a section titled \"Dosierplatten einstellen\" which translates to setting the doser plates. One of the steps mentioned is: \"Überprüfen Sie, ob Sie den kleinen Spalt zwischen den Dosierplatten sehen.\" That means checking if you can see a small gap between the dosing plates.\n\nThe key part here is \"kleiner Spalt,\" which I think translates to \"small crack\" or \"small gap.\" The question specifically asks for this dimension in millimeters. So, from the context, it seems that when the dosierplatten are closed correctly, there's a small visible space between them. This is important because if the plates are too close, the dosage might be incorrect, either too high or too low.\n\nI don't see any specific measurements given in the text, like 0.5 mm or something. It just mentions that you can see a small crack when they're closed properly. So, maybe the answer is that there's a visible small gap, but without an exact measurement provided in the context.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the dimension in millimeters. Since the context doesn't specify a number, perhaps it's not possible to give an exact figure. However, sometimes in technical documents, such gaps are standardized. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking again, on page 135, after setting up the machine correctly, you should see a small gap between the dosierplatten when they're closed. The text doesn't provide a specific measurement, so I can't extract an exact number from it.

It also warns about potential contact with chemicals like Kunststoffdünger, advising protective clothing and safety gloves.\n\nThe key part here is where it mentions using a feeler gauge to measure small gaps. The exact sentence is: \"Mit einer Fühlerlehre können Sie kleine Abstände genau messen.\" This translates to \"With a feeler gauge, you can measure small gaps accurately.\"\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the material of the feeler gauge recommended for this purpose. The context doesn't explicitly name the material but focuses on using the tool correctly and safely. However, in many industrial contexts, feeler gauges are typically made from materials like stainless steel or nickel because they're durable and resistant to wear.\n\nSince the context doesn't specify the exact material, I might have to infer based on standard practices.

One of these steps is about removing metal seal rings. The specific instruction says: \"Nehmen Sie die Metalldichtringe ab.\" Translating that from German, it means \"Remove the metal seal rings.\"\n\nSo, the term \"Metalldichtringe\" translates to \"metal seal rings.\" This indicates that these are components used for sealing purposes, likely on the agitator axle. The context doesn't specify the exact material beyond referring to them as \"metal,\" but in technical documents, when parts like seals are mentioned without specific materials, it's often standard to assume they're made of a common material unless stated otherwise.\n\nIn many industrial contexts, especially with machinery and seals, stainless steel is a commonly used material. It's durable, resistant to wear, and suitable for various environments. Since the context doesn't provide any other details about the composition of these rings, I can infer that they are probably made of stainless steel as it's a typical choice for such applications.\n\nI should also consider if there's any mention of alternative materials in the context. However, the only information given is about removing them and their function as seals. There's no indication of different materials being used elsewhere or any specific mentions of other metals like aluminum or brass.
