It mentions that with the border spreading plate and one closed dosing unit, you can drive along the field edge using a half spreading pattern filled to 100%. The text also talks about optimizing the spreading pattern to reduce environmental pollution by adjusting the border spreading plate.\n\nThen it says something about a trapezium-shaped spreading pattern converting to a triangular one with complete overlap by reducing the working width on sloping passes. It mentions that the usual setting is 50% for the overlap percentage, and you can adjust this in the GEOCONTROL manual. There's also a tip to set the overlap on the field boundary to 0 if you don't want any spreading there.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern. From the context, I see that when using the GEOSPREAD function with the border spreading plate, the overlap is set to 50%. The trapezium-shaped pattern becomes triangular with complete overlap at this setting. So, it seems like the full field spreading pattern uses a 50% overlap.\n\nI should make sure there's no other information in the context that contradicts this. Looking again, I don't see any other percentages mentioned for the full field spread. The only other mention is about adjusting the boundary overlap to 0, which is separate from the full field setting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is 50%.\n</think>\n\nThe overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is **50%**.",

So it seems like the system in question is the weighcells on the spreader itself.\n\nLooking further, there's mention of a computer in the distribution box comparing these measurements with the set application rate. This suggests that the weighcells are connected to the distribution box, which then uses this data to adjust the dosing unit accordingly.\n\nThere's also some information about communication issues between the control panel and an external system, but that seems more about integration rather than the measurement itself.

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nI see a line that says \"With the data from the spreading chart book and the automatic calibration tests that the spreader carries out every 75 kg or every minute...\" So it mentions two intervals: every 75 kg and every minute. \n\nHmm, so does this mean it's doing the tests both when it applies 75 kg of fertilizer and also every minute? That seems a bit confusing because applying 75 kg would be a specific event, but doing it every minute is more frequent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. It could be that the spreader performs automatic calibration tests either after every 75 kg application or every minute. So depending on how often you use the spreader, it might trigger the test at different times.\n\nBut the question is asking for how often it carries out these tests. The context says \"every 75 kg or every minute,\" which suggests that each time a certain amount is applied (75 kg) or each time a minute passes, a test happens. That seems like two separate triggers for testing.\n\nI think the key point here is that the spreader does automatic calibration tests both when it has applied 75 kg of fertilizer and also every minute. So the frequency isn't just once per certain amount but also checks every minute, which might be for continuous adjustment based on real-time data.\n\nBut to answer how often they are done, I should note both intervals: every 75 kg application and every minute. However, if the question is looking for a single interval, maybe it's referring to the more frequent one, which is every minute. But since the context specifies both, perhaps the answer includes both triggers.\n\nWait, but the user might be asking for the frequency in terms of time intervals, so mentioning both 75 kg and every minute makes sense. So the spreader performs automatic calibration tests at two intervals: each time it applies 75 kg of fertilizer and also every minute during operation.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader carries out automatic calibration tests every 75 kg of fertilizer applied and every minute during operation.\n\nAnswer: The spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg of fertilizer applied and every minute.",

It also talks about connecting a special cable set for speed measurement, either via the tractor's speed sensor or an adapter cable connected to the IsoMatch. There's a mention of a standard cable called \"IM Tellus Input\" used for other connections.\n\nSo, if the tractor lacks ISOBUS, they can add it with an IsoMatch power cable set. Once that's done, the driving speed from either the tractor or a trailed machine is sent via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch. The IM Tellus Input cable is used for other connections but specifically mentions speed and RPM sensors.\n\nWait, the question is about how the speed is transmitted when there's no ISOBUS. From the context, it seems that without ISOBUS, you need a special cable set to connect either the tractor's speed sensor or an adapter to IsoMatch. So, the answer would involve using this cable set to capture the speed signal from the tractor's electronics.\n\nI think the key point is connecting the speed sensor or adapter to IsoMatch via a special cable set.

It talks about greasing the threaded rods of the vanes, hooking them into position, pressing them in well, placing lock nuts, and fastening them with a specific torque. There's also a mention of wear patterns and when to replace the vanes.\n\nLooking for specific information related to torque, I see a section labeled \"Anzugsmomente Stahl\" which translates to steel tightening torques. This part lists various torque values with different numbers and letters, like 4.6.0,10; 8.8.0,13; etc. The numbers seem to be in the format of major diameter and pitch, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThe question is asking specifically about the torque for vane lock nuts. In the context, after placing the vanes, it says to fasten the lock nuts with 50NM. That seems like a direct answer. However, there's also a table later on that lists torques for different types of fasteners like self-locking nuts and hexagon bolts.\n\nWait, but the initial instruction mentions applying 50NM when fastening the lock nuts.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are a few calculations mentioned. The first one is 27 (m) x 8 (km/h) x 25 (kg/ha). Hmm, that seems like a multiplication of three numbers: 27 meters, 8 kilometers per hour, and 25 kilograms per hectare. But I'm not sure how these units relate to each other or the flow rate.\n\nThen there's another calculation: 3 x 9 = 27 kg/min. This looks more straightforward\u2014multiplying two numbers together to get the flow rate in kg/min. The first part mentions a result of 9 kg/min, but that seems too low compared to the second calculation which results in 27 kg/min.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The context also talks about setting the discharge point as J and doing manual calibration tests. But those don't directly relate to the formula for flow rate.\n\nI think the key part is where it says \"Calculate the required flowrate with fine application: 3 x 9 = 27 kg/min.\" So, that's a multiplication of two numbers\u20143 and 9\u2014to get 27 kg per minute. That seems like the specific method used in the context to determine the flow rate.\n\nBut the question is about the general formula. The first calculation uses three numbers: 27 m x 8 km/h x 25 kg/ha, which equals 6000 kg/min? Wait, no, that doesn't match up because 27x8=216, and 216x25=5400, not 600. Maybe I did the math wrong.\n\nWait, let me recalculate: 27 m multiplied by 8 km/h is 216 m\u00b3/h. Then multiplying by 25 kg/ha (hectare). But wait, 1 ha is 10000 m\u00b2, so 25 kg per 10,000 m\u00b2 would be 0.0025 kg/m\u00b2. So 216 m\u00b3/h times 0.0025 kg/m\u00b2 equals 0.54 kg/min. That doesn't match the given result of 9 kg/min.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm confusing units here. Alternatively, perhaps the first calculation is a specific case, and the second one is the general method. The second part clearly states 3 x 9 = 27 kg/min as the flow rate for fine application.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the context provides two methods: one using three numbers multiplied to get 600 (but that seems off) and another using 3 times 9 to get 27 kg/min. Since the second method is more straightforward and results in a reasonable number, I think that's the formula they're using.\n\nTherefore, the general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer in kg/min seems to be multiplying two numbers together, possibly based on specific application rates or other factors.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is derived from the context as:\n\nflowrate (kg/min) = 3 x 9 = 27 kg/min.\n\n**Answer:** The formula is 3 multiplied by 9 to get 27 kg per minute.",

It could lead to injury. Then there are specific steps before leaving the tractor: switching off the PTO shaft, releasing hydraulic pressure, turning off the electronic control system, switching the tractor off, removing the key from the ignition, and engaging the parking brake.\n\nAfter that, it mentions that after switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise because the machine will continue running due to inertia.

These include releasing hydraulic pressure, switching off the electronic control system, switching off the tractor, engaging the parking brake, waiting for all parts to stop moving before approaching, wearing protective clothing like gloves and shoes, and following instructions carefully.\n\nSo, from this, I can extract two main actions that must be done in case of failure or stoppage. The first is to ensure the machine is completely stopped and safe before working on it.

There are mentions of inspections, safety precautions, and communication issues between the control panel and external systems, but none of these pertain to the pressure limit itself.\n\nAnother point is about not trying to stop leaks with fingers and using protective gear, which is important for safety but doesn't relate to the pressure limit. Similarly, there's a mention of not exceeding 210 bars in another context, but it's the same as the first one.\n\nSo, focusing solely on the specific information related to the question, the maximum hydraulic pressure allowed is clearly stated as 210 bars.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum hydraulic pressure allowed for the system is **210 bars**.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the required distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc. Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each line of the context to find any mention of this specific measurement. The context is in German, but I can still read it as it's written here.\n\nLooking at line 6: \"g Achsstand des Schleppers\" \u2013 that translates to something about the axle position, probably not relevant.\n\nLine 7: \"h Abstand zwischen der Mitte der Hinterachse und der Mitte des Hubarmkupplungspunkts (3)\" \u2013 this is about the distance between the middle of the rear axle and the hub arm coupling point. Not what I'm looking for.\n\nLine 8: \"Abstand zwischen dem Schwerpunkt der Maschine oder dem Gewicht und dem Herz des Hubarmkupplungspunkts (2)\" \u2013 this is the distance from the machine's center of gravity or weight to the hub arm coupling point. Still not the discharge bushing and spreading disc.\n\nLine 9: It seems to be repeating something about considering add-ons or water weight in the tires, which might relate to overall weight distribution but not the specific measurement between two parts.\n\nThen I see lines mentioning wearing protective clothing and following instructions because of potential injury from friction. That's a safety note, so probably not relevant for the distance measurement.\n\nFurther down, there are steps about attaching the machine, raising it, switching off the tractor, placing supports, etc. These seem like setup or maintenance procedures.\n\nLooking specifically for \"distance between discharge bushing and spreading disc,\" I find that in the context, line 6 mentions \"Abstand zwischen der Mitte der Hinterachse und der Mitte des Hubarmkupplungspunkts (3)\" which is about the rear axle and hub arm coupling point. Not directly related.\n\nWait, but then later in the context, there's a mention: \"The distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be 1.0 mm.\" That's exactly what I'm looking for. It says if this distance is too great or too short, it causes issues with the spreading pattern or machine damage.\n\nSo the required distance is 1.0 mm. The question asks for the distance in meters, but since 1 mm is 0.001 meters, that would be 0.001 m. However, sometimes such measurements are given in millimeters when precise, so I need to check if the answer expects meters or millimeters.\n\nThe question specifically says \"in m,\" which stands for meters. So 1.0 mm is 0.001 meters. But it's more common in machinery to specify this distance in millimeters rather than converting to meters. However, since the instruction is to provide the exact information as per the context and the question asks for meters, I should convert it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context uses \"m\" as a unit abbreviation, but in the given text, it's written as \"1.0 mm,\" so perhaps the answer expects 1.0 mm. But the question explicitly says to provide the distance in meters. So I need to convert 1.0 mm to meters.\n\n1 mm = 0.001 m, so the required distance is 0.001 meters.\n</think>\n\nThe required distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc is **0.001 meters**.",

From the first list, I see that 3900 is one of the numbers under \"Content of the hopper (l)\". But wait, the question is about the total weight, not the hopper content.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section labeled \"Gesamtgewicht\" which translates to total weight.

So Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900 has a total weight of 3900 kg? But that seems too high for a machine part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers under \"Gesamtgewicht\" are the permissible weights. The first line after Gesamtgewicht is Kg <, which might mean less than or equal to. So maybe the total weight must be less than or equal to 3900 kg? But that doesn't directly answer the question.\n\nI'm a bit confused. The context mentions that the calculated values must be smaller or equal compared to permissible values. It also talks about using a bridge scale to measure overall weight and axle loads.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers after \"Gesamtgewicht\" are the permissible weights for different models.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several steps involved in maintaining the vanes. The first thing mentioned is greasing the threaded rods of the vanes. Then, hooking and positioning the short vanes correctly. After that, placing the other two vanes similarly. Pressing them well and putting on the lock nut, then fastening the lock nuts with a torque of 50NM.\n\nNext, there's a section about even wear of the vanes. It says the long vanes are positioned in groups of three, and the first vane in the direction of rotation will wear out more quickly. There's a tip to exchange the first vane after the fixed one and the short vane over time. Then, after another period, exchange the foremost vane with the central one.\n\nThen there's a part about maintenance intervals. It lists several items that need checking and maintenance, including checking bolts and nuts, hydraulic system, condition of the agitator and axle, condition of the vanes, and checking and setting the dosing mechanism. The numbers next to these are 130, 131, 133, etc., but I'm not sure what those refer to.\n\nThe question is asking specifically about the interval for inspecting the condition of the vanes. From the context, it seems that the vanes require regular inspection as part of maintenance. The maintenance intervals list includes checking the condition of the vanes, and looking at the numbers, maybe every 100 hours? Wait, no, the numbers are 130, 131, 133, which might correspond to specific pages or sections rather than time intervals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. The maintenance section lists several items with numbers like 130, 131, 133. It says \"da il y af te r th e first 10 hou rs we ekly ev ery 100 ho urs min. 1 x per ye ar As recommeded If worn Page 0 1...\" Hmm, that seems a bit jumbled. Maybe it's referring to intervals based on usage.\n\nLooking at the part about \"Maintenance intervals,\" it says things like \"Checking bolts and nuts\" is item 130, \"Checking the hydraulic system\" is 131, condition of agitator is 132, vanes is 43, and dosing mechanism is 133. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 43 is much lower than others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The context might be in German or another language, given the words like \"Berechnungen\" and \"Sicherheit.\" Maybe the numbers correspond to something else, like pages or steps rather than time intervals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the part about \"even wear of the vanes\" suggests that they need to be checked periodically to ensure they're wearing evenly. The tip says to exchange the first vane after the fixed one and the short vane over a period of time, then later exchange the foremost with the central one. This implies that there's a scheduled interval for checking their condition.\n\nLooking back at the maintenance intervals list, item 4 is \"Condition of the vanes.\" The other items have numbers like 130, 131, 133, which might be code numbers or references to specific sections. Since the question is about how often they must be inspected, and given that it's part of a regular maintenance schedule, I think the answer would be based on the maintenance intervals provided.\n\nIn the context, under \"Maintenance,\" it says to keep to the checking and maintenance intervals given below. Then, item 4 is condition of vanes. The other items have numbers like 130, 131, etc., but without more context, it's unclear if those numbers are time-based or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the part about \"da il y af te r th e first 10 hou rs we ekly ev ery 100 ho urs min. 1 x per ye ar As recommeded If worn Page\" is indicating that after every 10 hours, check every 100 hours, which would mean once a week? Or maybe it's saying something else.\n\nAlternatively, considering the maintenance intervals listed, if item 4 (condition of vanes) is one of them, perhaps it's checked at specific intervals. But without explicit time frames, I'm not sure. However, in the context, there's a mention of exchanging vanes over time, which suggests regular inspection to prevent wear.\n\nGiven that, and seeing that the maintenance intervals include checking the condition of the vanes, I think the answer is that they must be inspected as part of the regular maintenance schedule, specifically at the interval mentioned in item 4. But since the exact number isn't clear, perhaps it's every 100 hours or once a week.\n\nWait, looking again:",

It also mentions setting the discharge correctly by moving the bushing up or down to 1.0 mm from the spreading disc.\n\nWait, but I'm specifically looking for how often the height check happens. The context doesn't explicitly state a time interval like weekly or monthly. Instead, it seems like this adjustment is part of routine maintenance steps that should be done each time something else is checked, maybe as part of a regular schedule.\n\nSince there's no specific interval given beyond the general maintenance instructions, I might have to infer based on typical practices.

However, another part mentions checking the condition of the agitator axle, which is separate from the seal.\n\nI also notice a tip: after putting the first fastening bolt back in place, the plastic bearing ring can be let go. This indicates that once the bolts are secure, the seal is reinstalled. But this doesn't specify how often it should be done.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. The context includes steps where the metal seal rings are removed and replaced. It's a routine maintenance procedure, but without specific intervals mentioned. However, in industrial equipment, such as agitators, seals are typically replaced based on usage or wear. Since the context doesn't provide a time interval, perhaps it's assumed that it's part of regular maintenance without a specified frequency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculations section provides clues about usage. It mentions checking the height and adjusting if necessary, which could relate to seal performance. But again, no specific interval is given.\n\nI'm starting to think that the context doesn't explicitly state an interval for replacing the agitator seal. It only shows the process of removal and replacement but not how often it should be done. Without explicit information, I can't determine a specific interval.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide a specific interval for replacing the agitator seal.",

                    "question": "With what torque in Nm must a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and with a 0.13 friction be fastened?",
                    "expected_answer": "420 Nm",
                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the correct torque in Nm for an M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction factor. Let me start by looking through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section about \"Steel tightening torques\" which lists different values under columns labeled with numbers like 4.6.0, 10.9.0, etc., each followed by two numbers separated by a comma, such as 10.9.0,10 and 10.9.0,13.\n\nI also notice that the rows are numbered from 0 to 9, and the columns seem to correspond to different factors or categories. The first column is labeled M5, then M6, up to M18. Since the question is about an M18 bolt, I should look at row 17 (since it's zero-indexed) but wait, actually, looking back, the rows are numbered starting from 0 as well. So M5 would be row 0, M6 row 1, and so on until M18 which would be row 17.\n\nWait, no, in the context provided, the first column is labeled \"M5\" at position 0, then \"M6\" at position 1, up to \"M18\" at position 9. So each row corresponds to a specific bolt size. Therefore, M18 would be at row 9.\n\nLooking at row 9, the entries are:\n- 10.9.0,10\n- 10.9.0,13\n\nI think the first number after 10.9 is the quality level (which matches the question's 10.9), and the second number is the torque in Nm. So for M18, with 10.9 quality, there are two torques: 10 and 13.\n\nBut wait, the context also mentions a friction factor of 0.13. I need to check if this affects the torque value. In the initial part of the context, under \"Steel tightening torques,\" it lists various factors like Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques with values such as 4.6.0,10; 4.6.0,13; etc.\n\nLooking at that section, each entry seems to be a combination of quality, friction, and torque. For example, \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10\" might mean for a certain quality level (4.6), with a specific friction factor (.0?), the torque is 10 Nm.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this. Maybe each triplet like 4.6.0,10 refers to a specific combination of factors. However, in the main table under \"Steel tightening torques,\" it lists for M5 to M18 with two numbers after the quality code, such as 10.9.0,10 and 10.9.0,13.\n\nGiven that the question specifies a friction factor of 0.13, I need to see if this is accounted for in the torque values provided. If the context doesn't specify how to adjust torque based on friction, perhaps the given torques already include the necessary adjustments or are standard values regardless of friction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0.13 refers to a specific column or factor that adjusts the torque. But looking back, I don't see any mention of adjusting for friction beyond what's listed in the main table.\n\nSo, focusing on the M18 row (row 9), with quality 10.9, there are two torque values: 10 and 13 Nm. Since the question asks for the torque that must be used to fasten the bolt, considering the friction factor, but without explicit instructions on how to adjust for it, I think the answer is either 10 or 13 Nm.\n\nHowever, in maintenance guidelines, sometimes higher torque is recommended to account for friction. But since the context doesn't specify a method to calculate adjusted torque based on friction, perhaps both values are provided as options depending on other factors.\n\nBut looking again, the initial part mentions \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques\" with entries like 4.6.0,10; 4.6.0,13; etc., which might imply that for a given quality and friction level, there's a specific torque. For example, if Quality is 4.6 and Friction is 0 (or .0), the torque is 10 Nm, but with higher friction, it's 13.\n\nBut in our case, the quality is 10.9 and friction is 0.13. I don't see a direct entry for that combination. However, looking at row 9, M18 has two entries: 10.9.0,10 and 10.9.0,13. Maybe the first number after quality is the torque without considering friction",

Let me start by looking through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section labeled \"Stainless steel tightening torques\" which seems relevant. Under this, there are some guidelines for torques in Newton meters (Nm). The rows have numbers like M5, M6, and so on, each followed by several numbers. \n\nLooking closer, the M6 row has values: 6.3, 9.9, 12.2, 8.4, 13.2, and 16.3. These are likely different torque settings for various aspects of the bolt, such as tightness levels or specific conditions.\n\nThe question specifies a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction value. In the context, I notice that there's a line: \"Torques.70 (A2).0.20.\" This seems to match exactly what the question is asking for. \n\nNow, looking at the numbers under Torques.70 (A2).0.20, the first number after M6 is 8.4 Nm. Since the context mentions that this corresponds to a torque of 8.4 Nm, I can conclude that this is the required value.\n\nI should make sure there's no other information that might affect this answer. The rest of the context talks about maintenance intervals and other torques, but nothing specifically contradicts or adds to the given data for M6 with 70 (A2) and 0.2 friction. \n\nTherefore, the correct torque is 8.4 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque is **8.4 Nm**.\n\nAnswer: 8.4",

It mentions that when using this method, you drive along the field edge and spread from the border inwards. The working width can be adjusted with the hydraulic plate, which allows for precise application.\n\nThe key points here are that it's used to spread fertiliser up to the property's border, aiming for maximum cover while minimizing loss.

One-sided is done by driving along the field edge and spreading inwards, whereas boundary track spreading involves driving down a sprayer tramline from the edge.\n\nNow, considering small gardens, I think about the size. Small gardens might have narrower borders or less area to cover. The context doesn't specify any limitations on the size of the garden but focuses on the method's functionality.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe context provided is in two parts: an indication section and a page from what seems like a manual or instructions. The indication section talks about when to perform the tray test, such as when using specific fertilizers not covered in a chart book, when there's a deviation in distribution, or with moderate quality fertilizers. It also mentions testing annually on both sides of the spreader and after any changes to the spreading mechanism.\n\nThen, looking at Page 40, it seems to be a table or list with options A, B, C, D, each describing issues with the spreader (too narrow, too wide, etc.) and corresponding actions. For example, if the spreader is strutting too narrowly (A), you adjust the outlet setting to direction A and repeat the test.\n\nNow, the question is whether the tray test can be done at 40\u00b0C. I don't see any direct mention of temperature in the context provided. The instructions focus on when to perform the test based on fertilizer type or spreader issues, not on environmental conditions like temperature.\n\nSince there's no information about temperature thresholds for performing the test, I have to conclude that the context doesn't provide specific guidance on this point. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe tray test cannot be determined as the context does not mention temperature conditions.  \n**Answer:** Not found in context",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided, there are mentions of \"Wartungsintervalle\" and \"Kontroll- und Wartungsintervalle,\" which I think refer to maintenance intervals or periods for checking and servicing. But these seem more about routine checks rather than specific components like the hydraulic border spreading plate.\n\nMoving on, on Page 86, it talks about using the H2O setting for border spreading and mentions that longer plates are supplied separately with the hydraulic border spreading plate. It also refers to the settings in the H2O spreading chart and indicates positions A to D. There's a mention of referring to instructions for correct installation.\n\nPage 87 details how to use the hydraulic border spreading plate in the field. The procedure includes switching off the tractor, engaging the parking brake, disconnecting the right spreading disc by sliding the connector to the right and securing it with a lock clip, lowering the border plate, checking that vanes don't touch the plate, adjusting the spreader based on the spreading chart for desired width, using same settings and coupling shaft mounting point as full field spreading. It also mentions starting the tractor again and switching on the control box.\n\nNow, looking specifically for any mention of actuation method\u2014whether it's pneumatically or another method. The context doesn't explicitly state that the hydraulic border spreading plate is actuated pneumatically. Instead, it focuses on how to install and use it in the field, mentioning settings and adjustments but not the type of actuation.\n\nI don't see any images provided in the context, so I can't infer anything from visuals. The key points are about maintenance intervals, installation instructions, and usage procedures without specifying the actuation method. Therefore, there's no direct information indicating that the plate is pneumatically actuated.\n</think>\n\nThe hydraulic border spreading plate cannot be actuated pneumatically based on the provided context.\n\nAnswer: No",

It also mentions that the rpm of the tractor engine must remain constant while spreading. Importantly, it talks about adjusting the speed by selecting another speed, not changing the RPM. \n\nThen, there's a part about how GEOCONTROL would switch off the spreading sections when passing the headland limit, but without GEOCONTROL, you just drive normally. It mentions that the usual setting is 50% overlap on the headland.\n\nNow, looking for information about the height of the fertilizer. The context doesn't explicitly mention anything about the flight height or trajectory of the fertilizer when not using GEOCONTROL.

The numbers go from 0 to 7, with each number corresponding to a different aspect like sound level, tractor power, etc. However, I don't see any direct information about corrosion rates in coastal versus inland regions.\n\nThe context also includes some German text, which mentions things like the hopper's content and filling levels, but again, nothing specific about corrosion. There are references to the GEOSPREAD Steuersystem and Bedienungsanleitung der Software, but these seem to be about the operating system and user manual, not related to corrosion.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's any indirect information that could imply differences in corrosion based on location. Coastal regions are typically more humid and have higher salt content in the air, which can accelerate corrosion. Inland areas might have less humidity and fewer corrosive agents, so maybe the machines in coastal areas would corrode faster.\n\nHowever, the context doesn't provide any explicit data or specifications about corrosion rates. It only talks about technical aspects like sound levels, tractor power, hopper sizes, etc., but nothing about environmental factors affecting corrosion.\n\nSince there's no specific information given about corrosion rates between coastal and inland regions, I should probably respond that this information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context mentions two different functions of the spreader: one-sided boundary spreading and boundary track spreading. In one-sided spreading, you drive along the field edge and spread inward. For boundary track spreading, you drive down a sprayer tramline from the edge towards the border.\n\nIt also talks about advising to spread the site first before the borders because during border spreading, the control system doesn't automatically calibrate, which can lead to incorrect dosing settings. This means the application rate might deviate from what's needed. Spreading the field first allows the control system to set the correct dosing.\n\nThen there's a part about a table where you can choose between YIELD and ECO settings. In YIELD mode, the loss over the field edge is greater than the environmental norm, so it shouldn't be used along waterways. In ECO mode, the loss is equal to or less than the norm, making it suitable for work near waterways.\n\nThe question is asking about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for the application rate. I'm looking for a specific percentage that ensures the correct application rate despite the potential issues with automatic calibration.\n\nFrom the context, I don't see any direct mention of speed reduction percentages. It discusses the need to adjust settings manually by spreading the field first and choosing between YIELD and ECO modes based on environmental considerations. There's no information about how much to reduce the speed or if a specific percentage is recommended.\n\nSince there's no data provided about speed adjustments, I have to conclude that the necessary information isn't available in the context given.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see there's an image mentioned with \"Metal seal ring.\" Then, under maintenance steps, one of them is \"Remove the metal seal rings.\" So, these are parts that need to be taken off during maintenance.\n\nLooking further down, there are some descriptions in German. The lines mention things like Prills, Kristalin, Mix, Pellets, Saat Schneckenk\u00f6rner (which I think translates to something like Screw Kernel Seeds), and Granulat. Each of these seems to describe different types of materials or products.\n\nI'm trying to find which one refers to the metal seal rings. The context mentions \"metal seal ring\" in the image, so that's a clue. Then, looking at the maintenance steps again, after removing the fastening bolts and the metal rings, there's a note about replacing the fertilizer sealing ring. So, the metal rings are separate from the fertilizer-related parts.\n\nIn the descriptions, line 3 says \"Prills\" are round, hollow inside, sometimes with small holes on top, very smooth. Line 4 describes Kristalin as cylindrical with rounded forms, also hollow inside and sometimes with small holes. Mix is a blend of kernels with different shapes or surfaces. Pellets are mentioned again, and Saat Schneckenk\u00f6rner refers to something like seed screw kernels.\n\nNone of these directly mention metal. However, the initial image and maintenance steps specifically refer to \"metal seal rings.\" Since they're called metal, it's likely that their material is metal, probably steel or another type, but the context doesn't specify further.\n\nSo, putting this together, the question asks for the material of the metal seal rings. The context refers to them as metal, so the answer should be \"Metal.\"\n</think>\n\nThe material of the 'metal seal rings' for the agitator axle seal is **Metal**.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the specific extension cable length in meters that's optimal for an ISO 11786 in-cab tractor connection. Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context mentions several things related to cables and connections for tractors. It talks about a standard \"IM Tellus\" cable set, which includes a 7-point plug. There's also an optional extension cable that can be used if the ISO 11786 in-cab connection is missing. The extension cable is meant to be connected to this 7-point plug.\n\nI'm looking for information about the length of this extension cable. Scanning through the context, I see mentions of \"extended ISO cable\" and \"replacement cable.\" It says that an extended ISO cable is available for a tractor-trailed spreader, which replaces the short cable already fitted. The key point here is that it's replacing the existing short cable with an extended one.\n\nThe term \"extended\" suggests that this cable is longer than the standard one. However, the context doesn't provide specific measurements or lengths in meters. It only refers to the extension as being available for replacement without specifying how long it is.\n\nSince there's no exact measurement given, I can't determine the precise length in meters. The answer would have to be that this information isn't provided in the context.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The key part is where it says \"after the expiry of the free test period.\" Hmm, that's the only mention I see about a test period. It doesn't specify how long this period lasts in days or weeks.\n\nI'm trying to remember if any other parts of the context give more details on the test period duration. Scanning through again, I don't see any numbers or time frames mentioned. The focus seems to be on what features are included after purchasing the licence, like Task controller and GEOSPREAD functions.\n\nSince there's no specific information about how long the free trial lasts, I can't extract a number from the context.

The question is specifically about the hopper cover's sail material and its UV resistance.\n\nI see that in the context, there are mentions of hopper covers. For example, line 4 talks about Kristalin being cylindrical with a smooth surface. Line 5 discusses Mix as a blend of particles with different shapes and surfaces. Then, lines 58-60 mention Pellets, Saat Schneckenk\u00f6rner, and Granulat.\n\nWait, but the question is about the sail material used for the hopper cover. I'm not sure if \"sail\" here refers to a specific part of the hopper or maybe a component attached to it. The context mentions that the electric hopper cover can be opened and closed to allow a larger fill opening. It also says that the sieve is used when spreading pellets.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sail material refers to the cover itself. Looking at line 4 again: Kristalin is described as having a smooth surface. Line 5's Mix has different surfaces. But I'm not seeing any mention of UV resistance directly in the context provided.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The context mentions that the hopper cover protects against humidity and dirt. It also talks about the electric hopper cover being used for protection. There's no explicit information about UV resistance in the context given.\n\nSo, based on this, I can't find any specific mention of UV resistance properties for the sail material.
