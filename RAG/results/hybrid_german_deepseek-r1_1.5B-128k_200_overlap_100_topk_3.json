The context talks about getting familiar with the machine, mentioning extra functions like a calculator, internet browser, camera screen (which might be optional), and so on. It also mentions saving and reading data from documents, tractor data, field data, etc., but that's more about what can be saved rather than the switch.\n\nLooking further down, there are sections about the control box. The first part says: \"Press the button for at least 1 sec.\" Then it adds, \"Always switch off the control box when you leave the tractor.\" It also mentions that if the box is engaged, unintended functions can be activated while in danger area, and the control box uses power, which might cause the tractor battery to flatten.\n\nThen there's a section about RATE Control. It says it's a variable dose controlled externally by an external signal. There's no mention of a switch button here. The next part talks about MULTI-RATE, which is another function that can be installed on the ISOBUS Wiegestreuer. For MULTI-RATE, they mention needing a supplementary license key.\n\nSo, focusing back on the control box: it's described as being optional because the camera screen is optional. It says you can switch the control box on and off by pressing the button for at least 1 second. The exact location of this button isn't explicitly stated in the context provided. However, from the earlier part about MULTI-RATE, I know that MULTI-RATE requires a supplementary license key, which might be associated with the control box.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the main switch button to turn on or off the control box. The context doesn't mention where this button is located beyond the fact that it's pressed for at least 1 second. So, based solely on the given information, I can't pinpoint the exact location of the switch button.\n\nTherefore, since there's no explicit information about where the main switch button is located in the context, I should respond with \"Unknown\" as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]\n\n<answer>\nUnknown\n</answer>",

There's no mention of a longer duration specified, so I can't assume more than that unless there's additional info.\n\nI should make sure not to include any extra information beyond what directly answers the question.

There's a section titled \"Wartungsintervalle\" which translates to warning intervals. It says that after the first operating hour, they should check all bolt and nut connections regularly. So, it specifies that after one hour of use, they need to check.\n\nLooking at the structure, there are numbered points under \"Kontrollieren\" (which means checking). The second point is labeled 2: »Kontrolle Hydrauliksystem« with a value of 131. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here because the question is about nuts and bolts.\n\nThe key part is the line: \"after the first operating hour, regularly (at least weekly).\" So, they check after one hour, but it doesn't specify exactly how long to operate before re-checking. It just says at least weekly. Wait, that might be a bit ambiguous because \"weekly\" could mean different things depending on context.\n\nBut looking back, the main instruction is about nuts and bolts becoming loose through vibrations. The specific part mentions checking after the first hour. So, maybe the answer should be one hour? But I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly that or at least weekly. However, since the question asks for how long to operate before re-checking, and the context says after the first hour, perhaps the answer is one hour.\n\nWait, but in the context, they mention \"after maintenance or repairs have been carried out.\" So maybe it's not just any time, but specifically at least weekly. Hmm, that complicates things because it depends on when maintenance has been done. But since the question doesn't specify whether maintenance has been done, I think the safest answer is one hour after initial setup and before any maintenance.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"regularly\" could mean weekly, but without knowing when maintenance has occurred, it's safer to go with the immediate check after the first hour. So, the answer should be one hour.\n</think>\n\nAfter initial setup and after any maintenance or repairs, the machine should be operated for at least one hour before re-checking all nuts and bolts.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

For example, \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10.\" and so on. The numbers here are all in decimal form with periods as thousand separators, but I think they're actually just representing the numerical values without the decimal points because 4.6.0 is probably meant to be 4600 Nm.\n\nSo, looking at each line: \"Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10.\" translates to 4600 Nm, and similarly for other numbers like 8.8.0 being 8800 Nm. The instruction is to extract the torque value, so I need to pick out each of these numerical values.\n\nI see multiple entries: 4.6.0, 8.8.0, 10.9.0, and others like 12.9.0.

However, the question isn't about the specific number but the precaution to take before working between the tractor and machine.\n\nIn the context, there's a mention of \"Wartungsintervalle\" which translates to time intervals for checking controls. The paragraph under that says it's necessary to put the machine on a supporting beam before moving between the tractor and machine. This ensures the machine can't drop if the power lift is operating while working in between.\n\nSo, the specific precaution here is putting the machine on a supporting beam to prevent dropping during lifting or lowering of the power lift.

The text talks about decoupling ropes, specifically mentioning that they must never be tense and must provide sufficient freedom for movement even with the power lift in its lowest position. This is important because if the decoupling ropes are too tight, it could accidentally disconnect the quick coupling, leading to damage or injury.\n\nI also notice a section labeled \"Wartungsintervalle\" which translates to waiting intervals.

They mention that through open windows or other openings, they can get into Kunstdüngerstaub. In an open CABINE, there's a higher geräuschpegel. So, they're advising to use a closed CABINE instead and apply an ACTIVKOHLE FILTER in the LUFTEIFFEN.\n\nThen, they calculate the required flow rate using this formula: 27 meters multiplied by 8 km/h multiplied by 25 kg/ha. That gives them 600 kg/min. Wait, no, actually, let me check that again. The calculation is 27 (meters) times 8 (km/h) times 25 (kg/ha). Hmm, but wait, meters and kilometers are different units. I think they might have converted meters to kilometers or vice versa.\n\nWait, 27 meters multiplied by 8 km/h would be 216 km²/h. Then multiplying by 25 kg/ha gives 5400 kg/(h·km²). But since we're dealing with an area of 1 ha (which is 10,000 m² or 1 km²), the flow rate would be 5400 kg/h. To convert that to kg/min, divide by 60: 5400 / 60 = 90 kg/min.\n\nBut in the context, they mention 27 (m) x 8 (km/h) x 25 (kg/ha), which equals 600 flowrate required (kg/min). Wait, that doesn't match my calculation. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the units here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 27 meters times 8 km/h gives 216 km²/h, but since we're dealing with an area of 1 ha (which is 10,000 m² or 1 km²), maybe they're using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the formula is flow rate = width in meters multiplied by speed in km/h multiplied by area in ha.\n\nWait, let me try that: 27 meters times 8 km/h times 25 kg/ha equals 27 * 8 * 25 = 5400 kg/(h·km²). Since 1 ha is 1 km², the flow rate would be 5400 kg/h. To convert to kg/min, divide by 60: 5400 / 60 = 90 kg/min.\n\nBut in the context, they say 27 (m) x 8 (km/h) x 25 (kg/ha) equals 600 flowrate required (kg/min). That doesn't match my calculation. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's width in meters multiplied by speed in km/h multiplied by area in ha and then divided by some number. Let me try that: 27 * 8 = 216, times 25 gives 5400 kg/(h·km²). Since 1 ha is 1 km², it's 5400 kg/h. Divided by 60 minutes per hour gives 90 kg/min.\n\nBut the context says 600 flowrate required (kg/min), which is ten times higher than my calculation. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the units or the formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses a different conversion factor.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula is width in meters multiplied by speed in km/h multiplied by area in ha and then divided by 100 to convert from m² to km²? Let me try that: 27 * 8 = 216, times 25 gives 5400 kg/(h·km²). Divided by 100 is 54 kg/h. That's way too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula uses width in meters multiplied by speed in km/h multiplied by area in ha and then divided by 3600 to convert hours to minutes? Let me try that: 27 * 8 = 216, times 25 gives 5400 kg/(h·km²). Divided by 3600 is 1.5 kg/h. Still too low.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is width in meters multiplied by speed in km/h multiplied by area in ha and then divided by 100 to convert from m² to km²? Let me try that: 27 *",

This could be relevant if the tray test requires specific tools or components from this manufacturer, but it's not directly related to materials.\n\nSince the context doesn't list any physical tools or equipment required for the tray test beyond what's mentioned on Page 2, I think the answer should focus on the product details provided there.

The section about disengaging the PTO shaft says: \"PTO shaft rotates after disengaging.\" That's one thing that happens when you stop using the PTO. But it also mentions that if someone is working on the machine and the PTO is running, they can't stay inside or allow anyone to enter while the machine is still moving.\n\nSo, when the PTO is off, the machine continues to run because of inertia. That means people could get hurt if they're near the machine during this time. Also, after disengaging, the PTO shaft stops rotating, which might cause movement issues or injury for those around it.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything else. The context doesn't mention other dangers except about staying inside and allowing others to stay within danger area while the machine is running. So the main points are that disengaging causes the PTO shaft to stop, leading to possible movement issues and injuries for those near the machine.\n\nI think that's all. I'll summarize it in a concise way.\n</think>\n\nWhen the PTO shaft is disengaged, the machine continues moving due to inertia, posing risks to those nearby.

The text under that says: \"Causes Use in the field Be careful that nothing gets jammed It is also easy to get injured while working with the spreader.

That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.\"\n\nAfter that, under \"Indication,\" it says further instructions on cleaning after work, ensuring longevity, etc., and mentions water can cause electrical failures.\n\nThe main point is about the temperature when using high-pressure cleaners. The context doesn't explicitly state a maximum temperature for water or steam. However, I know that in industrial settings, certain temperatures are standard to avoid damage. Steam at 100°C (212°F) and water at 40°C (77°F) are common, but sometimes higher temperatures might be used if necessary.\n\nBut looking back, the specific instructions say \"low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.\" Wait, that's about the pressure and temperature for the cleaner. So when using high-pressure cleaners, you have to use low pressure and keep it below 40°C (which is 104°F). But for water or steam, I think the standard is higher temperatures.\n\nWait, no, actually, in industrial settings, sometimes they might use higher temperatures if needed. The context doesn't specify a maximum temperature for water or steam when cleaning with these methods. It only mentions that high-pressure cleaners have specific pressure and temperature limits. So perhaps the question is about the maximum allowable temperature for using water or steam without exceeding safety limits.\n\nBut in the given instructions, it's not clear what the maximum temperature is for water or steam. The context doesn't provide a direct answer on this. It only mentions that high-pressure cleaners have specific pressure and temperature constraints. So maybe the question is about whether there's a standard maximum temperature when using these methods.\n\nWait, but in the given instructions, it says \"low pressure and temperature; 80 bar and maximum 40 o C.\" That refers to the cleaner, not the water or steam used for cleaning. So perhaps the context doesn't specify a maximum temperature for water or steam. Therefore, without explicit information, I can't determine a specific maximum temperature.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, when using steam, it's often kept below 100°C (212°F) to avoid overheating. Similarly, water might be kept at around 40-60°C depending on the application. However, without specific instructions from the context, I can't assume a maximum temperature.\n\nWait, but looking back, in the initial part of the context, it says \"Arbeiten Sie in einer geschlossenen Kabine\" and mentions that using high-pressure cleaners requires low pressure and temperature below 40°C. So for steam or water, perhaps the standard is higher temperatures, like 100°C (212°F) if needed.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the context provides this information.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum hydraulic pressure allowed for the hydulic system based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several lines discussing the hydraulic system. The first line says: \"Das externe System kom- muniziert nicht mehr mit dem  Bedienpult                 Das Bedienpult und das externe System  kommunizieren nicht in derselben Sprache  miteinander  Überprüfen Sie die Einstellungen des Bedi- enpults anhand der Daten des externen Sy- stems, siehe Gebrauchsanleitung Bedienpult, Schlepper und externes System\". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It seems like it's talking about communication between the external system and the bedienpult (which I think is German for control panel or computer). The first part says the external system doesn't communicate with the bedienpult anymore in the same language. Then it asks to check the settings of the bedi- enpult using data from the external system, referencing the software guide and something called Schlepper.\n\nThe second line is a repetition: \"Das externe System kom- muniziert nicht mehr mit dem  Bedienpult                                    Die Regelung der Dosis durch ein externes  Signal ist nicht eingeschaltet                                                               Schalten Sie die Akzeptanz des externen Si- gnals ein Siehe die Bedienungsanleitung der Soft- ware.\" This seems to confirm the same points again. It mentions that communication isn't possible anymore in the same language, and it's about regulating dosage using an external signal without being set up. It also suggests changing the acceptability of the external signal.\n\nThe third line is another repetition: \"Checking the hydraulic system\\n[Image]\\n[Image]\\nReplacement intervals\\nMaintenance\\nHydraulic oil is under high pressure\\nNever try to stop a leak with your fingers. Never try to locate a hydraulic leak or try to contain it by hand! When inspecting always use appropriate aid (e.g. a piece of wood or sheet metal) and wear safety goggles, safety gloves and gloves! High pressure fluid easily penetrates skin and clothes, causing severe injuries. In the event of injury, contact your physician immediately!\\nDo not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars\\nPrevent the pressure in the hydraulic system from exceeding 210 bars! Working above the permitted pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.\\nKeep your distance from the hydraulics during inspecting and test running\\nUse a stick to bend the hydraulic hoses when checking them for leakage. That way you will keep at sufficient distance. Oil jets or hoses that snap back may cause serious physical injury due to the prevailing pressure and temperature.\\nWork safely on the hydraulic system\\nThe hydraulic system could be under high pressure. Do not work on the hydraulic system without:\\n· releasing the pressure from the hydraulic system,\\n· switching off the electronic control system,\\n· switching the tractor off,\\n· the key must be removed from the ignition,\\n· engage the parking brake of the tractor,\\n· using the proper tools,\\n· wearing safety glasses, gloves and shoes.\"\n\nLooking through these lines, I need to find where it says \"maximum hydraulic pressure allowed\". Scanning each line:\n\n- The first line mentions communication but doesn't specify pressure limits.\n- The second line repeats the same points about communication.\n- The third line is a repetition of the same information.\n\nI don't see any mention of maximum hydraulic pressure. It just talks about high pressure, oil under pressure, and working conditions. So based on this context, there's no explicit information provided about the maximum allowable hydraulic pressure in bars. Therefore, I can't extract an exact answer from the given text.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information regarding the maximum hydraulic pressure allowed for the hydulic system.\n\n<answer>\n    The context does not specify the maximum hydraulic pressure allowed for the hydulic system.\n</answer>",

The first step says, \"Unscrew the bolts attaching the discharge bush to the star a few times.\" Then it goes on about moving the discharge bushing upwards or downwards until the distance to the spreading disc is 1.0 mm. It also mentions putting 1.0 mm thick plates between the discharge bush and the spreading disc and lowering the discharge bush onto them.\n\nWait, I don't see any mention of a rope here. The steps are all about adjusting the discharge bushing relative to other components like the spreading disc or adding support plates. There's no step that talks about the distance between the rope and the discharge bushing opening. So maybe the question is referring to something else.\n\nThe user provided an answer earlier, which was \"1.0 mm.\" But I need to make sure if that's accurate based on the context. The steps mention moving the discharge bushing until the distance to the spreading disc is 1.0 mm. That seems to be the key point here. So the required distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc is 1.0 mm.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the rope and discharge bushing opening. If there's no mention of a rope in the context, maybe it's referring to another part. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake by including steps that don't relate directly to the question. \n\nI should double-check if any other parts of the context talk about ropes or openings between components. Scanning through, I see mentions like \"dosing mechanism\" and \"searing bolt nuts,\" but nothing about ropes or discharge bushing openings relative to a rope.\n\nSo maybe the answer is indeed 1.0 mm based on the provided steps, even though it's not directly answering the question as phrased. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended for me to infer from other parts of the context that the distance between the rope and the discharge bushing opening is also 1.0 mm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the required distance between the rope and discharge bushing opening, but in the provided steps, it's about moving the discharge bushing relative to the spreading disc. So perhaps the answer should be that there isn't enough information from the context, or if it's 1.0 mm as per the steps.\n\nWait, looking back at the context, I see a line: \"Hinweise zur Korngrößenverteilung: · Wenn der Durchmesser der Kunstdüngerkörner zu 10 % oder mehr geringer als 2,0 mm ist, ist dieser Kunstdünger schwer zu verteilen, vor allem bei großen Arbeitsbreiten. Die Folge kann in einer weniger optimalen Verteilung und in Erntegutschäden bestehen.\"\n\nBut that's about the diameter of a specific component, not the distance between two openings.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is 1.0 mm based on the steps provided, even though it doesn't directly address the rope and discharge bushing opening as per the question. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the distance is 1.0 mm because of some other component mentioned in the context.\n\nWait, another thought: The user's instruction says to extract precise information from the context. If there's no mention of a rope or openings between components, perhaps the answer should be \"Unknown\" since it's not provided. But that doesn't make sense because the steps do mention moving the discharge bushing relative to the spreading disc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to another part of the process where a rope is involved. Perhaps in the context, there are other steps or details about ropes and openings. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the provided context, I don't see any mention of a rope opening or its distance from the discharge bushing. The only relevant step is moving the discharge bushing to 1.0 mm from the spreading disc. So perhaps the answer should be that there's no information about the rope and discharge bushing opening distance in the provided context.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read through the steps again:\n\n1. Unscrew the bolts attaching the discharge bush to the star a few times.\n2. Move the discharge bushing upwards or downwards until the distance to the spreading disc is 1.0 mm.\n3. Put 1.0 mm thick plates between the discharge bush and spreading disc and lower the discharge bush onto them.\n4. Turn on the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.\n5. Check the height again and adjust it if necessary.\n6. Lower the dosing mechanism by turning the fastening bolt nuts upward.\n",

Then it says there are three fine dosing openings: 3 open holes for standard and 1 with two thick holes for fine application.\n\nNext, I see another part about switching the tractor off, removing the key from ignition, and engaging the parking brake. After that, pulling the hand-grip of the fine application lever out. Setting it until the arrow indicates the desired position. Letting go to check if it's locked. Then setting the fine application lever on the other spreading disc in the same way.\n\nLooking at the exact line section, there are two images showing ExactLine and ExactLine-Symbol.

Maybe it's a specific icon or part of the image. Since the context only mentions the placement and description, perhaps the symbol itself isn't detailed here. But in the exact line section, there are two images: ExactLine and ExactLine-Symbol.\n\nSo, when the kit is enabled, the symbol on the spreading disc should indicate that.

It also mentions that you can use a cable with an RS232 plug to connect signals from an external system to the tellus control box, and the plug pin occupation is in the tellus control box operating manual.\n\nI don't see any other mention of RS 232 anywhere else in the context. So the answer should be that the RS 232 connector is located within the Tellus control box's operating manual.\n</think>\n\nThe RS 232 connector is found in the Tellus control box's operating manual, specifically on page 144.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

But 43 isn't in hours or years; it might be a specific maintenance step. Alternatively, maybe the context is about the agitator and its axle, but that's not related.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

It says:\n\n\"43\"\n\nBut without knowing what 43 stands for in terms of intervals, it's hard to say. Maybe it's a typo or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the context is referring to another part.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed that under \"Grease the threaded rods of the vanes,\" there's an interval mentioned: \"Keep to the checking and maintenance intervals given below to keep the machine in good working order.\" It lists:\n\n- 10 hours weekly\n- Every 100 hours\n- As r eco mme nde d If worn Page\n\nSo, perhaps the vanes are checked every 10 hours or every 100 hours.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how often the bushing height should be checked and the discharge set. Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see a list of steps under \"  Unscrew the bolts attaching the discharge bush to the star a few times.\" That's about unscrewing some bolts, which probably relates to adjusting the bushing position.\n\nNext, there are several steps that mention checking the height. The first one is: \"Check the height again and adjust it if necessary.\" So that seems like a check every time they go through these steps.\n\nThen, another step says: \"Lower the dosing mechanism by turning the fastening bolt nuts upward.\" That's about lowering the dosing mechanism, which might involve checking its position relative to something else. I see later in the context that it mentions checking the distance between the agitator axle and the sealing ring must be the same on all sides. So maybe this is another check.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again:\n\n1. Unscrew some bolts.\n2. Move the discharge bushing up or down until the distance to spreading disc is 1.0 mm.\n3. Put 1.0 mm thick plates between the discharge bush and spreading disc and lower the discharge onto them.\n4. Turn on the discharge bushing bolts.\n5. Check height again, adjust if necessary.\n6. Lower dosing mechanism by turning fastening nuts upward.\n7. Check position of dosing mechanism relative to agitator axle.\n\nSo steps 2, 3, and 6 are about adjusting or lowering the bushing and dosing mechanism. Step 5 is about checking the height again after moving it up or down. Steps 4 and 6 involve adjustments, but step 6 is about lowering the dosing mechanism, which might be a specific check.\n\nWait, in step 3, they mention putting plates to lower the discharge bush onto them, which could mean adjusting the position. Then step 6 says \"Lower the dosing mechanism by turning the fastening bolt nuts upward.\" That's another adjustment and check.\n\nSo overall, it seems like after moving or lowering the bushing, you have to adjust again if necessary. Also, when lowering the dosing mechanism, you need to ensure the agitator axle is at a certain distance from the sealing ring on all sides.\n\nI think the key points are that the bushing height needs to be checked and adjusted each time it's moved or lowered. The specific steps mention moving up/down until 1mm separation, putting plates if needed, turning the fastening nuts upward to lower the dosing mechanism, and ensuring consistent distance from the agitator axle.\n\nSo the answer should mention that the bushing height is checked and adjusted after each movement or lowering, with specific instructions on how much to move and any necessary adjustments.\n</think>\n\nThe bushing height must be checked and adjusted after moving it up or down until 1.0 mm separation and lower the dosing mechanism by turning fastening bolt nuts upward while ensuring consistent distance from the agitator axle on all sides.\n\nAnswer: The bushing height is checked and adjusted each time it's moved or lowered, with specific instructions for movement and adjustment of the dosing mechanism.",

The question is asking about the torque in Nm required for a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context provided. It seems like there are two main sections: one labeled \"A\" and another labeled \"B.\" Each section has bullet points that describe different torque specifications for various bolts.\n\nLooking at section A, it starts with a line about a Gutes Streubild, which is a good strength steel rod. Then it lists several entries from 0 to 2, each specifying the type of bolt (like M5, M6, etc.), the thread size, and the torque specifications in Nm.\n\nThe relevant entry for M18 would be under section A. The line says \"M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and with a 0.13 friction.\" So I need to find where this specific combination is listed.\n\nIn section A, the entries are numbered from 0 to 2, each corresponding to different torque values. For example, entry 0 has M5, 1.7, 2; entry 1 has M6, 2.4, 3.6; and so on up to entry 2 with M8, 13.\n\nLooking at the specific line in section A: \"M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and with a 0.13 friction.\" This seems to be under one of the entries. Checking the numbers, I see that for M5, there's an entry with 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. That would correspond to entry number 2 in section A.\n\nSo the torque value is 10.9 Nm. Therefore, the answer should be 10.9 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe torque required for a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction is 10.9 Nm.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

The first part talks about enabling and disabling sections on the display. Then there are links to different websites forIsoMatch Shop, which might not be relevant here since we're focusing on the terminal itself.\n\nLooking further down, under \"GEOCONTROL Section Activity,\" I see a section that says: \"The GPS antenna with DGPS accuracy allows satellite navigation for field-specific section control, variable dosing and field registration.\" This part mentions GPS, DGPS, and field-specific functions. It doesn't mention weather checking directly.\n\nNext, there's another link to IsoMatch Shop again, which is probably a website they use for purchasing accessories like the tellus or eye.

It mentions ISO 11786, illumination, and video engineering, which are related to lighting and communication, not weather.\n\nMoving down, there's a part about \"Schlepper full ISOBUS coverage.\" This section says that if the ISOBUS communication doesn't work on their schlep, they can install a Stromversorgungskabelsatz.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there's a section about starting the tractor engine and adjusting its speed. It mentions that the driving speed can only be selected from another option, which probably means you can't just change it manually. The tractor spreads fertilizer based on an offset set in 'TC Implement Settings', but when using GEOCONTROL, it automatically switches off the spreading sections at the headland limit.\n\nThe context also talks about how the overlap percentage affects where the field boundary is. It says that by setting this overlap, you can control whether the field boundary overlaps with the headland or not. The usual setting is 50%, but it's noted that this can be adjusted separately in the GEOCONTROL manual.\n\nLooking for information on fertilizer height, I don't see any direct mention of height being affected by GEOCONTROL settings. However, there are mentions about adjusting the offset and speed, which might influence how much fertilizer spreads or lands. But without specific data on fertilizer height, it's hard to pinpoint an exact maximum height.\n\nSince the question is about fertilizer height when spreading without GEOCONTROL over the headland, I need to see if any context provides a standard height for fertilizing fields.

Let me start by breaking down the terms.\n\nFirst, \"boundary spreading.\" From the context provided, I see that there's a section about one-sided boundary spreading using a hydraulic border spreading plate. It mentions that this method can be adjusted to spread less or more on either side of the field edge. The working width is adjustable based on the optional extra feature.\n\nLooking at the context, under \"Operation,\" it says that when one-sided boundary spreading and sending the flow of fertiliser granules with the hydraulic border spreading plate is used, the working width can be adjusted by changing the hydraulic border spreading plate. So, this method allows for variable spreading widths, which affects both the loss over the field edge and the quality of the cover.\n\nNow, the question is about seven-sided boundary spreading. The context doesn't mention anything about seven-sided spreading directly. It only talks about one-sided spreading with a single side being adjusted. There's no information on multiple sides or how many sides can be spread at once.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there isn't any specific information provided about seven-sided boundary spreading using a hydraulic border spreading plate.

They provided a context about preparing a machine for transportation on public roads and then asked which measures should be taken when stopping work. The answer given was \"Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.\" \n\nHmm, let me break this down. The question is about the specific steps that should be done before traveling on a public road with a tractor and machine. From the context, I see several points mentioned: checking if they're roadworthy, ensuring lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes are all working. They also mention fitting an additional reflector at the back of the implement.\n\nWait, the answer given was just \"Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.\" But that seems incomplete because it doesn't include all the necessary checks mentioned in the context. The user's question is about the appropriate measures when stopping work, which likely refers to these specific steps before traveling.\n\nSo, I think the answer should include all those points but maybe just list them as a numbered list or separate sentences. But since the instructions say to extract precise information and base it strictly on the context, I need to make sure I don't add anything extra beyond what's provided.\n\nLooking back at the context, under \"Preparing the machine to be transported,\" there are several steps listed. The key ones related to stopping work would be checking if they're roadworthy, ensuring all safety devices like lights and brakes are working, fitting an additional reflector, and possibly checking the quick coupling ropes of the power lift.\n\nSo, I should list these as separate points in the answer. Maybe something like:\n\n1. Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy.\n2. Ensure lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes are attached properly and working.\n3. Fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.\n4. Check the run of the quick coupling ropes of the power lift.\n\nBut wait, in the context, point 4 is under \"Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy,\" so maybe it's part of that initial check. So perhaps the answer should include all these steps as a list without overlapping too much with the main points.\n\nAlternatively, since the question is about measures when stopping work, which might be before traveling, I can focus on the specific checks related to stopping rather than just transportation. That would make sense because \"stopping work\" implies stopping before moving on.\n\nSo, in that case, the answer should include all the necessary steps for stopping work, which are:\n\n- Check tractor and machine roadworthiness.\n- Ensure lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes are working.\n- Fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.\n- Check the run of quick coupling ropes.\n\nI think that's a more precise answer because it directly addresses the question about measures when stopping work. It lists all the specific steps without including the broader transportation checks unless they're part of stopping work.\n\nWait, but in the context, point 4 is under \"Check whether tractor and machine are roadworthy,\" which includes checking the quick coupling ropes. So maybe that's included in the main check. Therefore, perhaps the answer should list all these points as a numbered list without overlapping with the main transportation checks.\n\nSo, I'll structure it as:\n\n1. Check if tractor and machine are roadworthy.\n2. Ensure lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes are working.\n3. Fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.\n4. Check the run of quick coupling ropes of the power lift.\n\nThis way, each step is clearly listed without overlapping with the main transportation checks, making it more precise and focused on stopping work measures.\n</think>\n\nThe appropriate measures for stopping work when preparing a machine involve checking its roadworthiness, ensuring all safety devices are functional, fitting an additional reflector, and verifying the quick coupling ropes. These steps ensure everything is in order before proceeding.\n\nAnswer:  \n1. Check if tractor and machine are roadworthy.  \n2. Ensure lights, warning indicators, protectors, and brakes are working.  \n3. Fit an additional reflector at the back of the implement.  \n4. Check the run of quick coupling ropes of the power lift.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are a few points mentioned about fertilizers. The first point says that crushed or damp fertilizer forms an encrusted layer beneath the agitator and blocks flow through dosing openings. That makes sense because if it's stuck, it would prevent water from reaching the discharge openings, which is bad for spreading.\n\nThe second point mentions a lump of damp fertilizer in the discharge bushing blocking flow from that opening. This also indicates that the fertilizer isn't letting water get through properly, causing issues with the spread pattern.\n\nAdditionally, there are some general points about handling and using the spreader. It says to use a hopper cover when under moist conditions, never leave it for too long in the spreader, etc. But those don't directly address why fertilizers attract water.\n\nThe exact question is asking why most types of fertilizer attract water. The context doesn't explicitly state this reason, but from what I know, fertilizers are typically water-soluble and can become wet due to moisture or chemicals in the environment. This would cause them to stick to surfaces, which is exactly what's described in the context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should mention that most types of fertilizer attract water because they become stuck on the surface when not properly cleaned, especially after use.\n</think>\n\nMost types of fertiliser attract water and can form large chunks due to their water-solubility, which causes them to stick to surfaces.

The key points are under the instruction \"Examine the spreading discs and the discharge opening to see what the cause of the failure/stoppage is.\" So that tells me that when there's damage, they're checking the spreading disc and the discharge opening.\n\nThen, it mentions adapting the discharge point as needed for easier access. If you still can't see the cause, remove the vanes to look better into the discharge opening. Passing an object like a screwdriver through the discharge opening helps find if there's something in or damage to dosing openings or agitator.\n\nThe text also says that if you see damage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing, the failure is most likely caused by a hard object. It mentions that the agitator might be damaged too and suggests first repairing the damage before continuing with spreading.\n\nSo putting this together, when there's damage to any of those components (vanes, spreading disc, discharge bushing), it's because a hard object is causing the failure or stoppingpage. The process involves checking each component, adapting the discharge point, removing damaged parts if necessary, and using an object like a screwdriver to inspect for damage.\n\nI think that's all the relevant information from the context. So the answer should explain that damage is caused by a hard object based on the given instructions.\n</think>\n\nThe damage to vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing is most likely caused by a hard object because it involves checking each component and using an object like a screwdriver to inspect for damage.\n\nAnswer: The damage is caused by a hard object as described in the context.",

The user also notes that if the machine is lubricated first, it helps prevent dirt, fertiliser, and water from entering the bearings. After cleaning, they mention greasing and oiling again to conserve resources.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section about warts (droughts) which mentions setting up control intervals. It says not to set up electrical components because water can cause failures. Then it lists specific control intervals: 10 days of bearing tests and 100 days per component.

The context doesn't explicitly mention any specific paint type, but it does talk about lubrication and cleaning steps. However, since the question is about the paint used for damaged work, I should focus on what's typically used in such scenarios.\n\nIn industrial settings, when preparing machinery for storage, they often use a combination of oil and grease as a protective coating. This helps prevent rust or corrosion over time.

So maybe the question is a bit tricky because it's asking for something that isn't directly stated in the context.\n\nThe question is: \"What is the minimum 'baud rate' for 'RS 232 connection'?\" Since there's no information about baud rate in the context, I should consider if any of the lines provide clues. The lines mention RS-232 connections and checking plug pin occupation, but not about data rates.\n\nI might be overcomplicating this. Perhaps the context is trying to guide someone on how to communicate using RS-232, but it doesn't specify the minimum baud rate.

The main focus is on the formulas for the actual volumes, which are used to determine how much each type of vane can wear before needing replacement.\n\nThe context also mentions a tip about exchanging vanes to ensure even wear and optimal spreading pattern.

It mentions that Arbeiten in a closed kabine and other openings can lead to severe health risks. There's some technical stuff about using an active kohlefilter in a closed cabine, which is used for cleaning and reducing stress on the machinery. \n\nLooking at the specific instructions under maintenance, there are steps mentioned like turning nuts, unscrewing bolts, moving the discharge bushing up or down, adjusting the bayonet ring, and ensuring the agitator axle distance remains consistent. There's also a mention of 1.0 mm plates between the discharge bush and spreading disc.\n\nWait, I think I see something about the bayonet ring being moved halfway across the discharge baffle when closed. The context says \"the bayonet ring has moved halfway across the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the star.\" So that's a physical movement of 0.5 mm? Or is it more than that?\n\nBut wait, the question is about the 'small crack of light' dimension between dosing baffles when closed. I don't see any mention of a crack or a small distance here. Maybe the user made a typo and meant 'dosing baffles.' The context doesn't provide information on the size of this crack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's referring to the bayonet ring movement, which is 0.5 mm.

Since the question asks for meters, perhaps 144 refers to meters.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. The cable is called \"Input IM Tellus\" and the optional extension is specified with a length of 144. So if that's in meters, then it would be 144 meters.

Since Page 149 doesn't mention liters or a specific rate, and Page 150 talks about MULTIRATE which might be related but isn't directly answering the rate.\n\nI think I need to focus on what's clearly stated. The drain kit is available for emptying quickly, so maybe it refers to the fill level. But without specific numbers, I can't give an exact rate. Alternatively, perhaps the context doesn't provide enough information about the drain rate of the drain kit.\n\nWait, looking again, Page 149's text says \"A drain kit is available for emptying the hopper quickly.\" It doesn't mention liters per minute or any specific measurement related to the rate. So maybe there's no direct information on the drain rate in liters per minute from this context.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the answer should be \"Unknown\" since the question can't be answered based on the provided context.\n</think>\n\nThe drain kit is available for emptying the hopper quickly, but it does not provide specific information about the drain rate in liters per minute. Therefore, the answer is unknown.\n\nAnswer: [Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see mentions of hopper covers and electric hopper covers. The text talks about the hopper cover protecting the fertilizer from humidity and dirt. It also mentions that the sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening. \n\nLooking at the specific images and descriptions, there are two types mentioned: \"Hopper cover\" and \"Electric hopper cover.\" Each of these has a part called a \"sail,\" which is described as being able to fold back for a larger opening. The text also states that the electric hopper cover can be operated from the control box.\n\nNow, regarding the material used for the sail: the context doesn't explicitly mention the type of material, but it does say that the hopper cover must be mounted on top of the hopper or extension to protect against weather or spray. It also mentions that the electric hopper cover can be operated from the control box.\n\nI don't see any specific information about the material used for the sail in the context. The text is more about the structure and protection aspects rather than the material type. Therefore, I can't extract a precise answer based on the given context because there's no mention of the material itself or its UV resistance.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper cover must be mounted on top of the hopper or extension to protect against weather or spray.\n\n[Carefully extracted information: The hopper cover must be mounted on top of the hopper or extension to protect against weather or spray.]",
