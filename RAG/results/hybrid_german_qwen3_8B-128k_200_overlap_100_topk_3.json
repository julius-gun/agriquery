The context provided is from a manual, specifically pages 1 and 2. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the context carefully. On page 2, there's a section about the working width being adjusted with two factors: the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and the discharge point. Then it mentions that the working width is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox. \n\nWait, the question is about what determines the working width. The answer needs to be precise. The context says the working width is adjusted using the coupling shaft connection point and the discharge point. Also, the connection point on the central gearbox affects it. But the key points here are the coupling shaft's connection point (specifically the turtle or hare terminal) and the discharge point. \n\nThe answer should list these two factors. Let me check again. The text says: \"The working width is adjusted with: · the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and · the discharge point.\" Then later it mentions the connection point on the central gearbox. But the main factors mentioned are the coupling shaft connection point and the discharge point. \n\nSo the answer should be that the working width is determined by the coupling shaft connection point (turtle or hare terminal) and the discharge point. But the exact wording from the context is important. The answer needs to be as precise as possible. The exact sentence from the context is: \"The working width is adjusted with: · the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and · the discharge point.\" Also, the connection point on the central gearbox is mentioned, but maybe that's part of the coupling shaft connection point. \n\nWait, the context says: \"The working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox.\" So that's another factor. But the initial points are the coupling shaft connection point (with PTO speed) and discharge point. So combining these, the answer should include both the coupling shaft connection point (including the turtle/hare terminal) and the discharge point. \n\nBut the user wants the answer to be as precise as possible. The exact answer from the context is that the working width is determined by the coupling shaft connection point (correct one for PTO speed) and the discharge point. Also, the connection point on the central gearbox. Wait, but the context says \"the working width is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox.\" So that's an additional factor. \n\nBut the question is asking what determines the machine's working width. The answer should list all the factors mentioned. So the answer would be: the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed, the discharge point, and the chosen connection point on the central gearbox. However, the context mentions the connection point on the central gearbox as part of the coupling shaft connection. \n\nWait, the text says: \"The working width is adjusted with: · the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and · the discharge point. The working width of the spreader is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox.\" So that's two factors: coupling shaft connection point (with PTO) and discharge point, plus the connection point on the central gearbox. But maybe the connection point on the central gearbox is part of the coupling shaft connection point. \n\nAlternatively, the answer should be that the working width is determined by the coupling shaft connection point (turtle or hare terminal) and the discharge point. The context mentions that the terminal (turtle or hare) depends on the desired working width, which is part of the coupling shaft connection. \n\nSo the precise answer based on the context is that the working width is determined by the coupling shaft connection point (correct for PTO speed) and the discharge point. Also, the connection point on the central gearbox. But the exact wording from the context is: \"The working width is adjusted with: · the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and · the discharge point. The working width of the spread... is also determined by the chosen connection point for the coupling shaft on the central gearbox.\" \n\nTherefore, the answer should include both the coupling shaft connection point (with PTO) and the discharge point, plus the connection point on the central gearbox. But the user wants the answer to be as precise as possible. The exact answer from the context is that the working width is determined by the coupling shaft connection point (correct for PTO speed) and the discharge point.

However, the rest of the context talks about when to perform the test and other related information, but it doesn't list specific materials. \n\nThe key sentence here is: \"You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.\" But the context doesn't go on to specify what those materials are. The rest of the text doesn't mention any particular items needed for the test. \n\nSince the question is about the materials required, and the context only states that materials need to be purchased without detailing what they are, the answer should reflect that the exact materials aren't specified. Therefore, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any part of the context. Let me scan through again. The pages after the initial part talk about the tray test's purpose, when to perform it, and recommendations to use a specialist company. There's no mention of specific materials beyond the initial statement. \n\nSo, the answer should be that the materials required aren't specified in the context.

The sentence says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings.\" So \"both\" might refer to the two discharge bushings collectively having 2 nipples. But maybe each has one? Wait, the next part says \"1 grease nipple on all four actuators.\" So the discharge bushings have 2 in total? Or each has 2? Let me read the exact text again.\n\nItem 11: \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings · · · 126\". The phrase \"both discharge bushings\" might mean that each discharge bushing has 2 nipples, but that would be 4 total. Alternatively, \"both\" could mean the two discharge bushings together have 2 nipples. But the next instruction says to grease the 2 nipples of both discharge bushings. So maybe each discharge bushing has 1 nipple, and there are two bushings, making 2 total. Wait, the instruction says \"Grease the 2 nipples of both discharge bushings.\" So that would imply that each discharge bushing has 1 nipple, and there are two bushings, totaling 2. But the wording in item 11 says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings,\" which could be interpreted as each having 2, but that would be 4. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\nLooking at the context: \"11                     2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings  ·                                                                                                              126\". The key here is the phrase \"both discharge bushings.\" If there are two discharge bushings, and each has 1 nipple, then total is 2. But the way it's written could be read as each having 2. However, the next instruction says \"Grease the 2 nipples of both discharge bushings,\" which suggests that there are two nipples in total for both bushings. Therefore, the answer is 2. But wait, the user is asking how many grease nipples do the discharge bushings have. If there are two discharge bushings, each with 1, that's 2 total. So the answer is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe discharge bushings have 2 grease nipples.",

The user is asking for the maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the middle trough as a percentage in a ditch. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context mentions environmental standards and the maximum acceptable loss. Specifically, there's a part that says: \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo, the 1st trough's fertilizer is limited to 10% of the middle trough's quantity. That means the maximum allowed loss is 10%. The question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough,\" but based on the context, the 1st trough's loss is 10% relative to the middle. However, the question might be a bit ambiguous. Wait, the user is asking about the middle trough's loss. Wait, no, the wording is \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" Wait, maybe I need to parse that again.\n\nWait, the context says the 1st trough (which is in the ditch) must be a maximum of 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the loss is 10% of the middle trough's amount. But the question is asking for the maximum allowed loss of the middle trough's quantity. Wait, that might be a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the context.\n\nThe context states: \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo the 1st trough (in the ditch) is 10% of the middle trough. Therefore, the maximum allowed loss is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. But the question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" Wait, that's confusing. The middle trough is not in the ditch; the 1st trough is in the ditch. The middle trough is on the track. So the loss is the amount in the ditch (1st trough) compared to the middle. So the maximum allowed loss is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. Therefore, the answer is 10%.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the ditch is 10% of the quantity in the middle trough.  \n**Answer:** 10%",

The user is asking for the sound level in dB of a Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with its rear window opened.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has several rows with different configurations and their corresponding dB values. Let me scan through the entries.\n\nLooking at row 4: \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\" with values 73.8 and 84.6. Wait, the labels are in German. \"Schlepper\" is tractor, \"streuer\" is spreader, so this seems to be the Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) setup. The dB values here are 73.8 and 84.6. But which one is the correct value? The context might have some duplicates. \n\nLooking further, row 5 mentions \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB)\" with 73.0 and 87.2. Then there's a mention of \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) (dB)\" in row 4 again, same as before. Also, row 5 has \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + Ex- actLine (dB)\" which seems similar to the previous entry. \n\nWait, the question is about the Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with the rear window opened. However, the context doesn't mention anything about the rear window being opened. All the entries here are about different configurations, like adding ExactLine or having a different spreader setup. The dB values provided are for different scenarios, but none specify the rear window status. \n\nThe user is asking for a specific condition (rear window opened) that isn't mentioned in the context. The available data only includes measurements for the tractor with spreader (Kali 60) without any mention of window status. Therefore, there's no information in the context about the sound level when the rear window is opened. \n\nSo, based on the instructions, if the information isn't present, I should respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". Since the question's specific condition (rear window opened) isn't addressed in the provided data, the answer should be that it's not found.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how often the condition of the vanes must be inspected. I need to find the specific information from the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of inspection intervals related to the vanes. The context has several sections. The first part talks about assembling vanes, greasing, positioning, etc. Then there's a section about even wear and exchanging vanes over time. Then there's some German text about weight calculations and safety. Then there's a section titled \"Maintenance intervals\" with a table.\n\nLooking at the \"Maintenance intervals\" section, there's a list of inspections. The fourth entry is \"Condition of the vanes\" with a reference to page 43. But the question is about the interval, not the page. However, the maintenance intervals section lists different tasks with their intervals. The first entry under \"Maintenance intervals\" says \"Inspection\" with a note: \"da il y    af te r th e first  10 hou rs we ekly ev ery  100  ho urs min. 1 x  per ye ar As  r eco mme nde d If  worn Page\". Wait, that seems like a garbled text, maybe a typo or translation error. The original might have been in another language, perhaps German, but the text here is a mix. \n\nLooking at the structure, the first line under \"Maintenance intervals\" is \"0                                                       Inspection                                                                                                                    \n1                                        »Checking bolts and nuts«                                ·       ·                                                                        130\n2                                  »Checking the hydraulic system«  ·                             ·                                                                                131\n3                  Condition of the agitator and the agit tator axle  ·                                                                                                                 \n4                                           Condition of the vanes  ·                                                                                                               43\n5                      »Checking and setting the dosing mechanism«                                ·                                                ·                               133\"\n\nSo, the entries are numbered 0 to 5. The \"Inspection\" under 0 might be the general inspection, but the specific entries for vanes are under number 4. However, the text next to it says \"Condition of the vanes  ·                                                                                                               43\". The number 43 might be a page reference. But the user is asking about the interval, not the page. \n\nLooking back at the initial part of the context, there's a line that says \"Maintenance intervals\" and then the text \"da il y    af te r th e first  10 hou rs we ekly ev ery  100  ho urs min. 1 x  per ye ar As  r eco mme nde d If  worn Page\". This seems like a garbled version of a sentence. Maybe it's supposed to be \"After the first 10 hours, weekly, every 100 hours, min. 1 x per year, as recommended, if worn.\" If that's the case, then the inspection intervals for the vanes might be weekly and every 100 hours. However, the exact text is unclear due to possible translation errors. \n\nAlternatively, the \"Condition of the vanes\" entry under number 4 might be linked to the maintenance intervals mentioned earlier. Since the user is asking specifically about the interval for inspecting the vanes, and the only mention of vanes in the maintenance intervals is under number 4, which might be part of the same interval as the other checks. However, the exact interval isn't clearly stated in the context. The garbled text might indicate that after the first 10 hours, inspections are weekly, then every 100 hours, and once a year. But without clear formatting, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest answer based on the context is that the vanes' condition is inspected as part of the maintenance intervals, which include weekly checks and every 100 hours. However, the exact answer might be \"weekly and every 100 hours\" based on the garbled text. But since the user wants an exact answer from the context, and the context doesn't explicitly state the interval for the vanes, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". However, the maintenance intervals section does mention the vanes under number 4, which might be linked to the intervals mentioned in the garbled text. Therefore, the answer could be \"weekly and every 100 hours\" as per the garbled text. But since the text is garbled, it's uncertain. The user might expect the answer to be \"weekly and every 100 hours\" based on the context's maintenance intervals. Alternatively, if the exact interval isn't present, the answer would be \"Unknown\". But given the structure, the answer is likely \"weekly and every 100 hours\".\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EX",

The context provided is in German, so I need to parse through that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of intervals or frequencies related to checking the bushing height or adjusting the discharge. The context has a section titled \"Wartungsintervalle\" which translates to maintenance intervals. Under that, there's a line that says: \"Halten Sie die nachstehenden Kontroll- und Wartungsintervalle ein, um die Maschine in einem guten Zustand zu halten.\" Then there's a table with numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and under each, some maintenance tasks. \n\nLooking at the first entry under number 0: \"Kontrollieren\" which means \"Check\". The next line says \"tä gl ic h               nac h  den e r st en 10  Be trieb sst und na ch  jeweils  1 0 0  Stunde n min. 1x pr o  J a hr\". This seems to be a list of intervals. Let me try to parse that. The text is a bit jumbled, but breaking it down: \"täglich nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden und nach jeweils 100 Stunden min. 1x pro Jahr\". Translating that: \"Daily after the first 10 operating hours and after every 100 hours, at least once per year\". Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe it's \"täglich\" (daily) after the first 10 operating hours, and then after every 100 hours, at least once per year? That seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe it's \"täglich\" (daily) after the first 10 hours, and then every 100 hours, at least once per year. But that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the correct parsing is \"täglich nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden und nach jeweils 100 Stunden min. 1x pro Jahr\" which would mean \"daily after the first 10 operating hours and after every 100 hours, at least once per year\". But that seems like conflicting intervals. However, the user's question is about the interval for checking the bushing height and setting the discharge. \n\nLooking back at the context, there's a mention of checking the height again and adjusting if necessary. The instructions mention adjusting the discharge bushing height to 1.0 mm. But the question is about the interval. The maintenance intervals section mentions that after the first 10 operating hours and every 100 hours, there's a check. However, the exact wording is a bit unclear. The line says \"täglich nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden und nach jeweils 100 Stunden min. 1x pro Jahr\". If \"täglich\" is daily, then after the first 10 hours, check daily, and then every 100 hours, at least once per year. But that seems contradictory. Alternatively, maybe it's \"täglich\" (daily) after the first 10 hours, and then every 100 hours, at least once per year. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the correct interval is once per year, but the text is jumbled. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the line: \"min. 1x pro Jahr\" which is \"at least once per year\". So maybe the interval is once per year. But the first part says \"täglich nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden\" which is \"daily after the first 10 operating hours\". So perhaps the initial check is daily after the first 10 hours, and then every 100 hours, at least once per year. But the user's question is about the interval for checking and setting the discharge. The answer might be that it's checked once per year. However, the exact wording is a bit unclear. The user's question is about the interval, so the answer is likely \"once per year\" as per the \"min. 1x pro Jahr\" part. Therefore, the answer is that the bushing height must be checked and the discharge set once per year.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nOnce per year.",

The context has two main sections. The first part mentions \"Stainless steel tightening torques\" and then lists some guidelines. There's a table with columns for Quality, Friction, Thread Torques, and then values for different M sizes. \n\nLooking at the first table, under Quality.Friction, there's 70 (A2) with 0.10, 0.20, 0.30.

Then the table rows are for M5 and M6. \n\nLooking at the M6 row: \"1 M6 6.3 9.9 12.2 8.4 13.2 16.3\". The first number after M6 is 6.3, then 9.9, 12.2, then 8.4, 13.2, 16.3.

Page 1 seems to be a manual with some technical details, but not much about fuel consumption. Page 2 has more information. \n\nLooking at Page 2, there's a section titled \"Technical specifications\" with various data points. The first part lists sound levels under different conditions, like tractor alone, tractor with spreader, etc. Then there's a section with \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" followed by numbers: 1875, 2550, 3225, 3900. These numbers might represent different specifications. \n\nWait, the question is about diesel consumption. The context mentions \"Content of the hopper (l)\" and \"Filling level (cm)\" etc., but nothing about fuel consumption or diesel usage. The numbers on Page 2 under \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" could be related to hopper capacity, but the user is asking about extra diesel, which isn't addressed here. \n\nI don't see any mention of fuel consumption or diesel usage in the context.

The question is about stopping the spreading process. \n\nLooking at the steps, there's a part that says: \"Start the tractor and engage the control box.

Wait, does engaging the control box close the dosing units, and then switching it off stops the spreading? \n\nBut the exact instruction for stopping might be in the step where they switch off the control box.

That action would likely stop the spreading process. \n\nI need to check if there's any other mention of stopping.

There's a section on \"One-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate\" which explains how to adjust the spread direction and settings.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the appropriate measures for road transport when stopping work. The context provided is in German, so I need to parse through that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for sections related to preparing for transport. The context mentions \"Preparing the machine to be transported\" and lists several checks. Under that section, there are points like checking roadworthiness, lights, brakes, quick coupling ropes, extra lighting, folding parts, setting to transport mode, weight distribution, and front weights. These seem relevant to road transport.\n\nThen there's a part about \"Transport\" under \"Sicherheit\" which mentions checking the uncoupling ropes of the quick coupling. It states they must not be taut and should have enough movement even when the crane is in the lowest position to prevent accidental uncoupling. Also, there's a note to drive carefully.\n\nThe question is about measures when stopping work. So, when stopping work, the user would need to ensure the machine is properly secured for transport. The key points from the context are checking the quick coupling ropes, ensuring they aren't taut, and having enough movement. Also, setting all parts to transport mode and checking weight distribution might be relevant, but the question specifically asks about stopping work, which might relate more to securing the machine before moving.\n\nWait, the exact instruction under \"Transport\" says to check the uncoupling ropes, ensuring they aren't stretched and have enough movement. That's a direct measure for road transport when stopping work. Also, the part about setting all parts to transport mode is important. But the question is about measures when stopping work, so the main points would be checking the uncoupling ropes and ensuring they are not taut. The answer should be precise, so I need to extract exactly what's mentioned. The context says \"Kontrollieren Sie die Entkupplungsseile der Schnellkupplung\" which translates to checking the uncoupling ropes of the quick coupling. The instruction is that they must never be taut and must have sufficient movement even when the crane is in the lowest position. So the answer should mention checking the uncoupling ropes for proper movement and ensuring they are not taut. Also, the part about setting to transport mode might be part of the preparation, but the specific measure when stopping work is the uncoupling ropes check. Let me confirm if there's any other part. The \"Set all parts... to transport mode\" is part of the preparation steps, but the question is about stopping work, which might be when you're about to transport. So the main measure is checking the uncoupling ropes. The answer should be concise, so the exact answer is checking the uncoupling ropes of the quick coupling to ensure they are not taut and have sufficient movement.\n</think>\n\n[Check the uncoupling ropes of the quick coupling to ensure they are not taut and have sufficient movement, even when the crane is in the lowest position.]",

These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.\" \n\nSo the direct answer here is that fertilisers attract water, leading to the formation of large chunks. The reason given in the context is that they attract water, which causes the chunks. The question is asking for the reason why they attract water, but the context doesn't go into the underlying cause, like chemical composition. It just states that they do attract water, which then leads to the problem of chunks. \n\nSince the question is asking for the reason, but the context only mentions that they attract water and the consequence, not the cause of the attraction. However, the exact information from the context is that they attract water, which forms chunks. The answer needs to be based strictly on the context. The user's question is why they attract water, but the context doesn't explain why they attract water. It just states that they do. Therefore, the answer should be that they attract water, as that's the information given. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" The context doesn't provide a reason for the attraction; it just states that they do. So the answer would be that the context doesn't explain the reason, but the fact is that they attract water. However, the user's instruction says to base the answer on the context. Since the context states that they attract water, but doesn't explain why, the answer should be that they attract water, but the question is why they do so. Since the context doesn't provide a reason, the correct answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Wait, but the user's instruction says if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, the context does mention that they attract water, but the question is why they do so. The context doesn't explain the reason for the attraction. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't provide the reason for the attraction. But wait, the question is phrased as \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" The context says that they do, but doesn't explain why. So the answer is that the context doesn't provide the reason, hence \"Unknown.\" However, the user's instruction says to extract the exact information that directly answers the question. The question is about the reason for attracting water, but the context only states that they attract water, not the cause. Therefore, the answer is \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't explain the reason. But maybe the answer is that they attract water to form chunks, but that's the consequence, not the reason. So the correct answer is \"Unknown\" since the context doesn't explain why they attract water.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The only related part is the phrase \"after the expiry of the free test period,\" which implies that the test period exists but the length isn't provided. \n\nSince the question is asking for the number of days and the context doesn't specify that, the correct answer would be that the information isn't found. The user might have expected a specific number, but based on the given text, there's no data on the duration. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking about the valve type and manufacturer used for the 'valve set' that comes with the hopper empty sensor.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has several pages, and the relevant part seems to be on page 148. Let me check that section again.\n\nOn page 148, under the \"Accessories\" section, there's a mention of the hopper empty sensor. The text says, \"The sensor usually comes with the valve set.\" But wait, the question is about the valve type and manufacturer. However, looking through the context, I don't see any specific mention of the valve type or the manufacturer. The context talks about the sensor and some other components like the hydraulic border spreading plate and ExactLine, but nothing about the valve set's specifications. \n\nThe user might be expecting information about the valve set, but the context only states that the sensor comes with a valve set. There's no detail on the type or manufacturer. So, based on the given information, the answer would be that the context doesn't provide that specific information. Therefore, the correct response is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking about the drain rate in liters per minute for the 'drain kit' used for hopper emptying. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of the drain kit's specifications. The context has several sections. Let me scan through them.\n\nOn page 149, there's a section about the calibration container and drain kit. The text says, \"A drain kit is available for emptying the hopper quickly.\" But that's just a general statement. There's no specific rate mentioned here.\n\nLooking further, the technical specifications on page 150 talk about the hopper's content, filling level, width, etc. But again, nothing about the drain rate. The numbers provided are in liters for the hopper capacity (like 1875, 2550 liters) but those are about the hopper's volume, not the drainage rate.\n\nThe question is specifically about the drain rate in liters per minute. The context doesn't mention any numbers related to how fast the drain kit empties the hopper. There's no mention of time or flow rate. \n\nSince there's no information about the drain rate's speed, the answer should be that it's not found in the context. The user might have thought there was a number, but based on the provided text, there's no data on the drain rate in liters per minute.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The terms \"sail\" here might refer to a part of the hopper cover, but the material isn't specified. \n\nI also check if there's any mention of UV resistance. The context talks about the hopper cover protecting against humidity and dirt, and the electric hopper cover's features, but there's no information about UV resistance. \n\nSince the question is about the sail material and UV resistance, and the context doesn't provide details on either, the correct answer should be that the information isn't found.
