The user is asking, \"What determines the machine's working width?\" I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context. The context mentions several things related to the machine's operation. There's a section about the formula for flowrate required, which involves working width (m), driving speed (km/h), and application rate (kg/ha). But the question is about what determines the working width, not the formula itself.\n\nLooking further, there's a part about the discharge point setting depending on the fertiliser type and flowrate. Then, there's a mention of the spreading chart providing the letter setting for the discharge point based on working width and application rate. Wait, the spreading chart gives the letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate. So the working width is a factor in determining the discharge point setting, but does it determine the working width itself?\n\nWait, the question is about what determines the machine's working width. The context might not explicitly state what determines the working width. The working width is likely a parameter set by the operator or based on the machine's physical setup. However, in the context, the working width is part of the formula for flowrate required. But the context doesn't mention what determines the working width. The answer might be that the working width is determined by the machine's physical dimensions or the operator's settings, but the context doesn't specify that. \n\nLooking again, the context says that the spreading chart provides the letter setting for the discharge point for the working width and application rate. So the working width is a parameter used in determining the discharge point setting, but the context doesn't state what determines the working width. Therefore, the answer might be that the working width is determined by the machine's physical setup or the operator's configuration, but since the context doesn't mention that, the correct answer based on the context is that the working width is a parameter used in calculations, but the context doesn't specify what determines it. However, the question is asking what determines the machine's working width. If the context doesn't mention anything about what determines it, then the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, the context does mention that the working width is part of the formula, but the actual determination of the working width isn't discussed. Therefore, the answer should be that the working width is determined by the machine's physical setup or the operator's settings, but since the context doesn't specify, the answer is \"Unknown.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Also, the context mentions \"the flowrate with a specific working width, application rate and driving speed is given in the fourth column of the spreading chart.\" So the flowrate is in kg/min, and the application rate is in kg/ha. \n\nTherefore, the advice to use fine application is based on flowrate (kg/min) being less than 40.

The rest of the context lists various settings and checks, like control system settings, PTO shaft rpm, driving speed, etc. But those are about the setup or checks, not materials. \n\nThe only mention of materials is in the second sentence: \"You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.\" But the context doesn't specify what those materials are. The answer needs to be based strictly on the context. Since the context doesn't list the specific materials, just that some are required, the answer should reflect that. \n\nThe user's question is about what materials are needed. The context says you need to purchase some materials but doesn't name them. So the correct answer based on the context is that the materials are required but not specified.

This means that even though the PTO is disengaged, the machine's moving parts could still be in motion. The context warns that approaching the machine during this time can cause serious or deadly injuries. \n\nSo the continued danger is the machine's moving parts still rotating because of inertia. The reason is that inertia keeps the machine running even after the PTO is turned off. The answer needs to be precise and concise, directly addressing both the danger and the cause. \n\nI should make sure not to include any extra information.

However, that seems related to general safety rather than welding after using fertilizer.\n\nWait, the question is about welding after using nitrate-containing fertilizer. The context mentions nitrate-containing fertilizer in the first part under \"INDICATION\" where it says \"When using fertiliser of moderate quality.\" But that's about testing, not welding. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a part about safety when handling fertilizers. The context also mentions checking the machine's condition before use, brakes, lights, etc. But nothing about welding specifically. \n\nWait, the user might be referring to a precaution related to the machine's condition after using certain fertilizers. However, the context doesn't mention anything about welding precautions. The only safety related to the machine is not using it for pulling and checking its condition. \n\nSince there's no mention of welding or specific precautions related to nitrate-containing fertilizers in the context, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" The user might be expecting a different answer, but based on the given text, there's no direct information.

I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for mentions of discharge bushings and grease nipples. The context mentions discharge bushings twice. Let me check each instance.\n\nIn the first mention: \"The discharge bushings are attached lower down to the agitator axle and have 2 grease nipples.\" So that's two here. Then later, there's another part that says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\" in the list under point 11. Wait, does that mean each discharge bushing has two, or total two for both? The first sentence says \"have 2 grease nipples,\" which implies each discharge bushing has two. But the second mention says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings,\" which might mean total two. But the first part says \"have 2 grease nipples,\" so maybe each has two. Wait, the context says \"the discharge bushings are attached... and have 2 grease nipples.\" So the plural \"bushings\" but the count is 2. Wait, maybe there are two discharge bushings, each with one? Or one discharge bushing with two? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first instance: \"The discharge bushings are attached lower down to the agitator axle and have 2 grease nipples.\" The subject is \"discharge bushings\" (plural), and they have 2 grease nipples. So that would mean that the discharge bushings (plural) have a total of 2 grease nipples. But maybe there are two discharge bushings, each with one? Or one discharge bushing with two? The wording isn't clear. However, later in the list under point 11: \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings.\" So \"both discharge bushings\" have 2 grease nipples. That suggests that each discharge bushing has one, since both together have two. Wait, but the first mention says \"have 2 grease nipples\" without specifying per bushing. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the discharge bushings refer to a single component with two nipples. But the context later mentions \"both discharge bushings,\" implying there are two separate ones. So if both have 2 grease nipples in total, that would mean each has one. But the first part says \"have 2 grease nipples,\" which could be total. So the answer is 2 grease nipples for the discharge bushings. But the user is asking how many do the discharge bushings have. The answer is 2. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The first mention says \"have 2 grease nipples,\" so the discharge bushings (plural) have 2. So the answer is 2. The second mention says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings,\" which would mean each has one, but that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the first mention is referring to a single discharge bushing with two nipples, and the second mention refers to two discharge bushings each with one. But the context says \"the discharge bushings are attached... and have 2 grease nipples.\" So the discharge bushings (plural) have 2. So the answer is 2. But the user is asking about the discharge bushings, so the answer is 2. However, the second mention says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings,\" which could mean that each of the two discharge bushings has one, totaling two. But the first part says \"have 2 grease nipples,\" which is a bit ambiguous. However, the answer should be based on the exact text. The first instance says \"have 2 grease nipples,\" so the answer is 2. The second mention says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings,\" which might mean that each has one, but that's not clear. But the first mention is more direct.

But then later, in the handle description, it's 1 open hole and 2 thick holes. \n\nHmm, this seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the context has two different scenarios. The first part refers to the spreading chart, where the symbol is 1 open hole. But the handle's indication is 1 open hole and 2 thick holes. \n\nBut the question is about the symbol on the handle.

The user is asking for the maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the middle trough in a ditch, expressed as a percentage.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context mentions environmental standards and fertilizer loss. There's a part that says, \"The maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. In order to comply with the standards the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough, standing in the imaginative ditch, must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\"\n\nSo, the key sentence here is that the first trough (which is in the ditch) can't exceed 10% of the middle trough's quantity. The middle trough is considered 100%, so the maximum allowed loss in the ditch (which is the first trough) is 10%. The question is specifically about the maximum loss in the middle trough, but wait, the wording might be tricky. Wait, the question says \"the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" Wait, the middle trough is the reference point here. The first trough (in the ditch) is 10% of the middle trough. So the maximum allowed loss in the ditch (which is the first trough) is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. Therefore, the answer is 10%. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of percentages related to the middle trough. The context also talks about the field edge loss being 10% of the center quantity, but that's for the field edge, not the ditch. The question specifically mentions the ditch, so the relevant part is the 10% for the first trough relative to the middle. Therefore, the answer is 10%.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the ditch is 10% of the quantity in the middle trough.",

The spreading chart is mentioned as providing the correct discharge point position based on these factors. \n\nThe question is about PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM.

But does it provide specific data points or charts for these settings? \n\nLooking again, the context says the discharge point is set based on application rate and driving speed, and the spreading chart gives the discharge point. However, the PTO shaft rpm is checked as part of the settings. The answer might be that the spreading chart provides the necessary information for the discharge point, which relates to the PTO speed. But the question is about PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM. \n\nWait, the context says \"the position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.\" So the PTO speed is part of the factors that determine the spreading pattern.

However, the PTO speed itself is a setting that needs to be checked. \n\nThe answer should mention that the spreading chart provides the correct discharge point based on application rate and driving speed, which in turn affects the PTO speed. But the question is about the information available to set both PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM. The context doesn't explicitly state that the spreading chart provides the RPM settings, but it does mention that the PTO speed is part of the factors. \n\nWait, the user might be conflating the discharge point with RPM. The discharge point is set based on application rate and driving speed, and the PTO speed is a separate setting. The context says to check the PTO shaft rpm, but doesn't specify where that information is found. However, the answer might be that the spreading chart provides the necessary information for the discharge point, which is related to PTO speed. But the question is about PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be that the spreading chart provides the correct discharge point based on application rate and driving speed, which is used in conjunction with PTO speed settings. However, the exact information about the RPM settings isn't detailed beyond checking them. \n\nSince the context doesn't explicitly state that the spreading chart provides the RPM values, but mentions that the discharge point is set based on application rate and driving speed, and that PTO speed is part of the factors, the answer might be that the spreading chart provides the correct discharge point based on application rate and driving speed, which is used to determine the PTO speed. However, the question is about the information available to set both PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM. \n\nWait, the context says \"the position of the discharge point combined with the position of the coupling shaft on the central gearbox, the PTO speed and the flowrate determines the spreading pattern.\" So the PTO speed is a factor, but the exact information to set it is not provided beyond checking it.

Wait, the columns are labeled 0, 1, 2. The first column (0) is \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" and the second (1) is \"Closed cabin\", third (2) is \"Rear window opened\". \n\nSo for row 4, the values under column 1 (Closed cabin) is 73.8 and column 2 (Rear window opened) is 84.6. The question specifies the rear window opened, so that would be the value in column 2 for row 4. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with rear window opened. So the answer should be 84.6 dB. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other row that mentions this. Let me check row 5: it's Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) + Ex- actLine (dB) with 73.0 and 87.2. That's with Ex-actLine, which isn't mentioned in the question. So the correct row is row 4, column 2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 84.6 dB.\n</think>\n\n84.6",

The number 43 is likely a reference to a page or section number. \n\nNow, looking at the maintenance intervals section, there's a table with intervals like daily, after the first 10 hours, weekly, every 100 hours, etc. The line for the vanes is under the \"Condition of the vanes\" entry, and the number 43 is associated with it. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the interval for inspecting the vanes. The number 43 might indicate a page where more details are found, but since the user's context doesn't include that page, I can't reference it here. \n\nThe instruction says to base the answer strictly on the context provided. Since the interval isn't directly mentioned in the context, and the only information is the page number 43, which isn't elaborated upon here, the correct response would be that the information isn't found in the context.

The user is asking for the torque in Nm required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a friction coefficient of 0.13.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information. The context has several sections. There's a table with different bolt sizes and torque values. The first part mentions M22 and M24 with various torque numbers, but those are probably for different sizes. Then there's a section about friction coefficients, noting that 0.10 is for oiled surfaces and 0.13 for dry. \n\nFurther down, there's a section titled \"Steel tightening torques\" with a list. The lines under that seem to be about different quality grades and friction coefficients. The line for 10.9 quality has entries for 0.10 and 0.13. Let me check the exact numbers. \n\nLooking at the context, the line for 10.9 is: \"Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13.\" Wait, the formatting is a bit unclear. But the numbers after 10.9 are 0,10 and 0,13. Maybe that's 0.10 and 0.13. Then the torque values for M18 would be in the same row. Wait, the M18 isn't listed in the first table. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first table starts with M5, then M6, etc. But the user is asking about M18. Wait, looking at the context again, the first table has M5, then M6, but the next lines have M22 and M24. Wait, maybe the second part has the data for different sizes. Let me check the exact lines.\n\nLooking at the context, after the friction coefficient note, there's a section with \"Steel tightening torques\" and then a line that says: \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13. Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13. Torques.12.9.0,10. Torques.12.9.0,13.\" \n\nThis seems to be a list of torque values for different quality grades and friction coefficients. The line for 10.9 quality has entries for 0.10 and 0.13. But the numbers after that are not clear. Wait, maybe the numbers are in the same line. Let me parse this. \n\nThe line might be structured as: Quality.Friction * Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13. Torques.10.9.0,10. Torques.10.9.0,13. Torques.12.9.0,10. Torques.12.9.0,13.\n\nBreaking this down, each entry seems to be \"Quality.Friction * Thread Torques.X.X.0,10. Torques.X.X.0,13.\" So for 10.9 quality, the torque values for 0.10 and 0.13 are listed. But the actual numbers are missing here. Wait, maybe the numbers are in the previous tables. \n\nLooking back, the first table has M5, M6, etc., but the M18 isn't listed there. The second table has M22 and M24. Wait, maybe the user is referring to the M18 in the second table? But the second table starts with M22. Wait, perhaps the M18 is in the same line as the 10.9 quality. Wait, the context is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user is asking about M18. The first table has M5, then M6, but the next lines have M22 and M24. The second part has \"Steel tightening torques\" and then the line with \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10.

The context has two main sections: one for stainless steel tightening torques and another for steel tightening torques. The question specifies \"stainless steel,\" so I should focus on the first section.\n\nLooking at the first section, there's a part that mentions \"Stainless steel tightening torques\" and then under that, there's a line: \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30.\" \n\nWait, the formatting here is a bit confusing. It seems like the entries are separated by spaces, but maybe it's a list of torque values for different quality and friction combinations. The line after that has numbers for M5 and M6. Let me check again.\n\nThe context has two tables. The first one under \"Stainless steel tightening torques\" has entries for Quality, Friction, Thread Torques, and then values for M5 and M6. The second table under \"Steel tightening torques\" has similar entries but with different quality numbers like 4.6, 8.8, etc.\n\nThe question is about a M6 bolt with 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction. Looking at the first table under stainless steel, the line for 70 (A2) and 0.2 friction would correspond to the torque value. The first table's line after the headers is:\n\n\"0                         M5                   3.6                   5.7                     7                   4.8                   7.6                   9.4\n1                         M6                   6.3                   9.9                  12.2                   8.4                  13.2                  16.3\"\n\nWait, the first line here is for M5, and the second line is for M6. The columns might be for different friction values. Let me try to parse the columns. The first column seems to be the quality (0, 1, etc.), then M5 and M6 sizes, followed by torque values. But the numbers are a bit jumbled. Let me look again.\n\nThe first line under stainless steel has \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30.\" This seems to list different quality and friction combinations. Then the next lines have M5 and M6 with numbers. \n\nThe line after that is:\n\n\"0                         M5                   3.6                   5.7                     7                   4.8                   7.6                   9.4\n1                         M6                   6.3                   9.9                  12.2                   8.4                  13.2                  16.3\"\n\nAssuming that the first column (0, 1, etc.) corresponds to the friction value, and the subsequent numbers are torque values for different qualities. For example, the first line for M5 has 3.6, 5.7, 7, 4.8, 7.6, 9.4. But this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the first column is the quality (like 70 (A2) or 80 (A4)), and the next columns are friction values (0.10, 0.20, 0.30). \n\nWait, the initial line under stainless steel says \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30.\" This seems to list the quality and friction pairs. So for 70 (A2) with 0.10, 0.20, 0.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking, \"For what other kind of connections can the IM Tellus Input cable be used?\" So, I need to find information in the provided context that answers this.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context. The context mentions several accessories and connections related to the IM Tellus Input cable. Let me look for parts where the IM Tellus Input cable is discussed in terms of other connections.\n\nIn the section under \"Input IM Tellus with ISO11786 In cab connection,\" it says, \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" Wait, that's a bit vague. Then there's a part about connecting the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch control box with the optional \"Sensor input IM Tellus.\" But that's an optional cable, not the standard Input IM Tellus.\n\nAnother part says, \"You can connect the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch control box with the optional 'Sensor input IM Tellus'.\" So the standard Input IM Tellus cable is used for other connections beyond the ISO 11786 in cab. The exact sentence is: \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" But what are those other connections?\n\nLooking further, the context mentions \"lights and ignition,\" \"Tractor CAN,\" and \"Video input\" as part of the standard Input IM Tellus connection set. Wait, the first paragraph under \"Input IM Tellus with ISO11786 In cab connection\" lists the standard items: ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional plug), and Video input. So the Input IM Tellus cable is part of a set that includes these. But the question is about other connections beyond the ISO 11786 in cab. The answer might be that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for connections like lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and Video input. However, the exact wording in the context is that \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" But what are those other connections? The context lists those as part of the standard set. So the answer is that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for connections such as lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and Video input. But the question is about \"other kind of connections,\" so the answer should list those. However, the exact answer from the context is that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those connections. Let me check again. The context says: \"A connection set is supplied as a standard item with the IsoMatch for: \u00b7 ISO 11786 In cab \u00b7 lights and ignition \u00b7 Tractor CAN (optional plug specific to the tractor required) \u00b7 Video input.\" So the Input IM Tellus cable is part of this set. Therefore, the other connections it can be used for are lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and Video input. But the question is asking for \"other kind of connections,\" so the answer should be those. However, the exact answer from the context is that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those connections. So the answer is that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for connections such as lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and Video input. But the user wants the answer to be precise and concise. The exact answer from the context is that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those connections. So the answer should be: \"lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional plug specific to the tractor required), and Video input.\"\n</think>\n\nlights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional plug specific to the tractor required), and Video input.",

So the answer would be that the context doesn't explain the reason, hence \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Wait, but the user's instruction says to answer based on the context. Let me check again. The context says \"Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks.\" So the answer is that they attract water, but the reason isn't given. The question is why they attract water. Since the context doesn't explain the cause, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the user's instruction says to answer based on the context. Wait, maybe the answer is that the context states they attract water, but the reason isn't provided. However, the user's question is asking for the reason, which isn't present. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But looking back, the user's instruction says to answer based on the context. If the context doesn't provide the reason, then the answer is \"Unknown.\" However, the user's example might have different expectations. Wait, the context says \"Most types of fertiliser attract water and can thereby form large chunks.\" So the answer is that they attract water, but the question is why they do. Since the context doesn't explain the reason, the answer is \"Unknown.\" But maybe the answer is that the context states they attract water, but the reason isn't given. However, the user's instruction says to extract the exact information. The exact information is that they attract water, but the question is why. Therefore, the answer is \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't explain the reason. Wait, but the user's question is phrased as \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" The context doesn't answer that; it only states that they do.

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any information related to chunk size or particle size that could cause blockage.\n\nLooking at the context, there are a couple of points mentioned. The first part says that if 80-100% of the fertilizer granules have a diameter between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertilizer is good to spread, regardless of the remaining granules. Then, it mentions that if 20% or more of the granules have a diameter greater than 4.75 mm, it's difficult for optimal distribution and could damage crops. \n\nThe key here is the 4.75 mm threshold. The question is about preventing blockage, but the context doesn't explicitly mention blockage. However, the part about granules larger than 4.75 mm causing issues might relate to blockage. The answer might be 4.75 mm as the maximum acceptable size. But I need to check if the context directly states this. The first point says that granules between 2.0-4.75 mm are acceptable, and anything larger than 4.75 mm is problematic. So the maximum acceptable size to prevent issues (like blockage) would be 4.75 mm. However, the question specifically mentions 'chunk' size, which might refer to larger particles. The context doesn't mention a specific chunk size, but the 4.75 mm is the upper limit mentioned.

The context mentions several times the importance of using a closed cabin with active carbon filters. The key sentence here is: \"It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets.\" \n\nWait, the question is about the type of filters. But the context doesn't specify the type, like whether they're HEPA filters or something else. It just says \"active carbon filters.\" The context doesn't mention any specific model, brand, or type beyond that. \n\nSo the answer should be exactly what's stated.

So the answer is that the recommended filters are active carbon filters. But the user might be expecting a specific type, but the context doesn't mention it. Therefore, the answer should be that the context doesn't specify the type beyond active carbon filters. But the question is asking for the type, and the answer is active carbon filters.

So the answer is that the recommended filters are active carbon filters. But the question is phrased as \"type of 'active carbon filters'\". So maybe the answer is that the type is active carbon filters. But the context doesn't specify any further details. Therefore, the answer is that the context states active carbon filters are recommended, but doesn't specify a type beyond that. Hence, the answer should be \"active carbon filters\" as the type. Wait, but the question is asking for the type of active carbon filters. Since the context doesn't mention any specific type, like HEPA or something else, the answer is that the type is active carbon filters. But that seems redundant.
