The context mentions that in the Feindosierstand, 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed. It also explains that when using the Feindosierhebel, you can close 2 out of 3 openings. The purpose here is to prevent clogging and allow for more precise dosing, especially for very small amounts. \n\nThe question is specifically about how many are closed during fine application. The term \"Feindosieren\" translates to fine dosing or precise dosing. The context states that in this mode, two of the three openings are closed. So the answer should be two. I need to make sure there's no other mention of different numbers. Scanning through again, the same information is repeated, confirming that two are closed.

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of overlap percentages or related terms.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a lot about the Auffangbehälter (catch container) and the filling level, which must never reach 100%. There's also information about the ExactLine and Grenzstreublech (border spreader) settings. The text mentions that the maximum allowable loss over the field edge is 10% of the amount spread in the middle. \n\nWait, the question is about the overlap percentage. The context says that the filling must never be 100%, and the loss over the edge is 10% of the middle amount. But the overlap percentage might be related to how much the spreader covers beyond the field. However, the exact term \"overlap percentage\" isn't directly mentioned. \n\nThe context does mention that the maximum loss is 10%, which could be related to the overlap. But the question is about the full field spreading pattern's overlap. Since the context states that the filling must never be 100%, and the loss is 10%, maybe the overlap is 10%? But I need to be precise. The answer should be based on the exact information given. The context says the maximum allowable loss is 10% of the middle amount, which might correspond to the overlap. However, the question is about the overlap percentage for the full field pattern. The context doesn't explicitly state the overlap percentage, but the 10% loss might be the answer. Alternatively, the answer could be 100% since the filling must never be 100%, but that's about the filling, not overlap. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the overlap percentage. The context mentions that the maximum loss over the field edge is 10% of the middle amount. If the full field spreading pattern's overlap is the amount that goes beyond, then maybe the overlap is 10%. But the exact term \"overlap percentage\" isn't used. The answer might be 10% based on the 10% loss mentioned. However, the user might be referring to the overlap as the percentage that's spread beyond the field, which is 10%. Alternatively, the answer could be 100% since the filling must not exceed 100%, but that's about the filling, not overlap. \n\nSince the context doesn't explicitly state the overlap percentage, but mentions 10% as the maximum loss, which could be the overlap, the answer might be 10%. But I need to check again. The question is about the full field spreading pattern's overlap. The context says the maximum loss is 10% of the middle amount.

The user is asking, \"What system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread?\" I need to find the exact answer from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context. The first paragraph mentions \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" Translating that, it says the spreader measures the amount of fertilizer being spread continuously via weighing cells. The key terms here are \"Wägezellen\" which translates to weighing cells. \n\nLooking further, the context talks about a computer in the distributor comparing the value with the set dose and adjusting accordingly. But the question is specifically about the system that measures the quantity. The answer should be the weighing cells. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other system mentioned. The GPS system is mentioned for location and speed, but not for measuring the fertilizer quantity. The software manual and other parts talk about dosing settings and variable rates, but the actual measurement is done by the weighing cells. \n\nSo the answer should be the weighing cells, or \"Wägezellen\" in German. The user wants the exact term from the context. The answer format requires it to be brief and precise, so just stating \"Wägezellen\" would be correct. No need for extra details. Let me double-check if there's any other mention. The context also mentions \"Dosiereinheit\" which is dosing unit, but that's part of the system that adjusts based on the measurement.

The text says the computer uses data from the spread table and automatic rotation tests that the spreader performs every 75 kg or each minute. Wait, that's about rotation tests, not calibration. But the user is asking about calibration tests specifically.\n\nAnother part mentions \"automatische Kalibrierung aus\" again, but the question is about the frequency of the tests. The context doesn't explicitly state how often the calibration tests are done. It does mention that the spreader performs automatic rotation tests every 75 kg or each minute, but that's a different process. The calibration tests aren't directly mentioned in terms of frequency.

The user is asking how the tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information. The context mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, you can use an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz (power supply cable set) to add it. Then, once the tractor is ISOBUS-ready, the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So the answer would involve using the IsoMatch power cable set to enable ISOBUS, then the speed is sent through ISOBUS. However, the exact steps might be more detailed. Let me check again.\n\nThe context says: \"Wenn auf Ihrem Schlepper die ISOBUS Kommunikation fehlt, können Sie diese durch einem IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz anbringen.\" So adding the power cable set enables ISOBUS. Then, \"Die Fahrgeschwindigkeit Ihres Schleppers... wird über den ISOBUS an IsoMatch durchgegeben.\" So once ISOBUS is enabled, the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS. \n\nBut the question is about the method when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So the answer is that you use the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to add ISOBUS, then the speed is sent through ISOBUS. However, the exact answer needs to be precise. The context also mentions that if the speed isn't measured at the machine but via the tractor, a speed sensor or adapter cable for the tractor's electronics is connected to IsoMatch. But that's for when the speed is measured on the tractor. \n\nWait, the question is about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. So the answer would be that you use the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS, then the speed is transmitted via IS, but the exact answer might be that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after enabling it with the cable set. However, the user might need the specific method. Let me check the exact sentences again.\n\nThe context says: \"Wenn auf Ihrem Schlepper die ISOBUS Kommunikation fehlt, können Sie diese durch einem IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz anbringen. Anschließend ist Ihr Schlepper vollständig ISOBUS-gerüstet und Sie können die Maschine mit dem IsoMatch Bedienpult anschließen und bedienen. Die Fahrgeschwindigkeit Ihres Schleppers... wird über den ISOBUS an IsoMatch durchgegeben.\"\n\nSo the answer is that the tractor's speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after enabling ISOBUS with the Stromversorgungskabelsatz. Therefore, the precise answer is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after using the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS communication. But the question is how to transmit the speed when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. The answer is that you use the Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS, then the speed is sent via ISOBUS. So the answer is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after enabling ISOBUS with the Stromversorgungskabelsatz. But the exact answer needs to be concise. The context says that once the Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used, the tractor is ISOBUS-ready, and the speed is sent via ISOBUS. Therefore, the answer is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after enabling ISOBUS with the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz. But the user might need the exact method. Alternatively, the answer could be that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after using the Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS. But the question is about the method of transmission, not the enabling. Wait, the question is how the speed is transmitted when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. The answer is that you use the Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS, then the speed is sent via ISOBUS. So the answer is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after enabling ISOBUS with the Stromversorgungskabelsatz. But the answer needs to be precise.

The context mentions several things related to torque moments. There's a part that says \"Anzugsmomente Stahl\" which translates to \"Torque moments for steel.\" Then there's a list of different torque values for various grades like 4.6, 8.8, 10.9, 12.9, with some values like 0.10 and 0.13 NM. But wait, those numbers seem very low for torque, maybe they're in a different unit or there's a typo?\n\nFurther down, there's a section that says \"Ziehen Sie die Sicherungsmuttern an (50 Nm)\" which means \"Tighten the safety nuts (50 Nm).\" The term \"Sicherungsmutter\" translates to \"safety nut\" or \"locking nut,\" which might be similar to a vane lock nut. The instruction here specifies 50 Nm as the torque value. \n\nBut I need to make sure that \"Sicherungsmutter\" is indeed referring to a vane lock nut. The context also mentions \"Tensilock (K100)\" and \"Whizlock\" as examples of lock nuts with an additional 10% torque. However, the specific instruction about tightening the safety nuts at 50 Nm seems to be the direct answer here. \n\nLooking back, the question is about vane lock nuts. The term \"vane lock nut\" might be a translation or a specific term for a type of locking nut. The context mentions \"Sicherungsmutter\" which could be the equivalent. Since the instruction says to tighten them at 50 Nm, that's the torque value. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of torque values. The earlier list has values like 0.10 and 0.13, but those are probably for different applications, maybe smaller components. The 50 Nm value is more likely for the safety nuts mentioned later. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 50 Nm. The key is to match the exact term in the context.

The question is asking for the maximum distance before the platform is mandatory. Since the condition is \"größer als 1250 mm\" (greater than 1250 mm), that means if the distance exceeds 1250 mm, the platform is required. Therefore, the maximum allowed distance without needing the platform would be just under 1250 mm.

The fourth step says: \"Stellen Sie die Ladeplattform, sofern diese versetzbar ist, zum Streuer, so dass der Abstand zwischen beiden maximal 200 mm beträgt.\" Translating that, it means: \"Position the loading platform, if it is adjustable, towards the spreader, so that the distance between both is at most 200 mm.\" \n\nAnother part mentions: \"Der Abstand zwischen der Maschine und der Plattform darf maximal 200 mm betragen.\" Which translates to: \"The distance between the machine and the platform must not exceed 200 mm.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that when positioning the loading platform relative to the spreader, the maximum allowed distance is 200 mm. Also, when moving the machine onto the platform, the distance should be no more than 200 mm. \n\nThe question specifically asks about the maximum distance between the spreader and the loading platform. The relevant part is the fourth step where it's stated that the distance between both should be at most 200 mm. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of a different distance. The other 200 mm reference is about the machine and platform, but the question is about spreader and platform. However, in the context, the spreader is referred to as \"Streuer,\" and the loading platform is \"Ladeplattform.\" The step that mentions positioning the platform towards the spreader with a max distance of 200 mm directly answers the question. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 200 mm.\n</think>\n\n[The maximum distance between the spreader and loading platform is 200 mm.]",

It says, \"Für eine gute Verteilung des Kunstdüngers müssen die linke und rechte Streuscheibe gleichmäßig streuen. Überprüfen Sie dies jedes Jahr.\" This translates to checking that both spreader nozzles distribute fertilizer evenly. \n\nAlso, there's a note about placing the catch containers horizontally using a spirit level. The test is for a working width of 24 meters, but can be adjusted. The materials list includes 7 catch containers, a measuring tape, and a spirit level. \n\nPutting this together, the tray test (Links-Rechts-Test) checks if the left and right spreader nozzles distribute fertilizer evenly.

Let me scan through the text.\n\nI see a section that says: \" Verwenden Sie nur geringen Druck bei niedriger Temperatur; 80 bar und 40 o C maximal.\" Translating that, it means \"Use only low pressure at low temperature; 80 bar and 40°C maximum.\" So the maximum pressure mentioned here is 80 bar. \n\nAnother part mentions using water or steam for cleaning, and the same 80 bar figure is there. The question specifically asks about pressure, so the key number here is 80 bar. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of pressure elsewhere. The rest of the context talks about temperature, safety precautions, avoiding certain areas, and drying the machine, but not about pressure again. \n\nSo the answer should be 80 bar.

The context provided is about preparing machinery for winter storage.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the part of the context that mentions white metal parts. The context mentions \"blanke Teile, wie Kolbenstangen der Hydraulikzylinder\" which translates to bare parts like piston rods of hydraulic cylinders. It also says to use konservierendes Fett or sprühen (blanke) Metallteile with Konservierungsmittel. \n\nThe key points here are that white metal parts (which are bare metal parts) should be protected. The specific action is to apply a protective grease or spray. The context also mentions using a grease that doesn't dry out or harden to avoid damage to cylinder seals. \n\nThe question is specifically about the precaution for white metal parts. The answer should mention applying protective grease or spray. The exact wording from the context is \"versehen Sie blanke Teile... mit konservierendem Fett oder sprühen (blanke) Metallteile... mit Konservierungsmittel.\" \n\nSo the answer should be that bare metal parts should be coated with protective grease or sprayed with conservation medium.

The rest of the context talks about cables, pin configurations, and part books, but not the location again. The key sentence is the first one. The answer needs to be precise and concise, so the exact location is the back of the control unit. No other details are necessary here. The answer should be in English as per instructions. Let me make sure there's no other conflicting info. No, the rest doesn't mention the location again. So the answer is the back of the control unit.\n</think>\n\nThe RS 232 connector is located on the back of the control unit.",

It says, \"Für eine gute Verteilung des Kunstdüngers müssen die linke und rechte Streuscheibe gleichmäßig streuen. Überprüfen Sie dies jedes Jahr.\" Translating that, it means that for good distribution, the left and right spreading discs must spread evenly, and this should be checked every year.\n\nAdditionally, in the \"Ausführung\" section, there's a repetition of the same point: \"Jährlich den Links-Rechts-Test ausführen...\" which again says to perform the left-right test annually.\n\nSo the key information here is that the check should be done yearly.

To comply with the norm, the amount of fertilizer in the first catchment tank in the fictional ditch must be at most 10% of the amount in the middle of the driving path (which is 100%). \n\nSo the maximum allowed loss is 10%. The question specifically asks for the percentage of the quantity in the middle trough. The middle trough is referred to as the \"Mitte der Fahrspur\" which is 100%, and the loss in the ditch is 10% of that.

The user is asking: \"From which machine point is the spreading height measured to the ground or the crop?\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find where the spreading height is mentioned. The context is in German, so I'll need to parse that carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about \"Höhenkorrektur bei Spätdüngung\" which translates to \"Height correction for late fertilization.\" Here, it mentions \"die erforderliche Höhe von 75 cm oberhalb des Gewächses\" which means the required height of 75 cm above the crop. Then there's a part about checking the height (75 cm über dem Auffangbehälter) which is 75 cm above the catch container. \n\nWait, the question is about the measurement point relative to the ground or the crop. The context says \"75 cm oberhalb des Gewächses\" (above the crop) and \"75 cm über dem Auffangbehälter\" (above the catch container). The catch container is part of the machine, so the height is measured from the catch container. But the question is about the ground or the crop. \n\nWait, the first mention is 75 cm above the crop, and then later it's 75 cm above the catch container. The catch container is part of the machine, so if the height is measured from the catch container, that's a machine point. However, the question is asking whether it's measured from the ground or the crop. The context mentions both: 75 cm above the crop and 75 cm above the catch container. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the machine point. The answer might be that the height is measured from the catch container (Auffangbehälter), which is a part of the machine. However, the user's question is phrased as \"from which machine point is the spreading height measured to the ground or the crop?\" So the answer would be that the height is measured from the catch container (Auffangbehälter) to the ground or crop.

But the question is about the measurement point relative to the ground or the crop. \n\nWait, the first part says \"75 cm oberhalb des Gewächses\" (above the crop) and later \"7,5 cm über dem Auffangbehälter\" (above the catch container). So the height is measured from the catch container. Therefore, the answer is that the spreading height is measured from the catch container (Auffangbehälter) to the ground or crop. But the question is phrased as \"from which machine point is the spreading height measured to the ground or the crop?\" So the machine point is the catch container. Therefore, the answer is the catch container. But the user might be looking for the exact term from the context. Let me check again.\n\nIn the context, the exact phrase is \"die Höhe (75 cm über dem Auffangbehälter)\" which translates to \"the height (75 cm above the catch container).\" So the height is measured from the catch container. Therefore, the answer is the catch container. But the question is about the measurement point relative to the ground or the crop. Wait, the height is measured from the catch container to the ground or crop. Wait, no. The height is measured as 75 cm above the catch container. So the measurement point is the catch container.

The answer should be \"Auffangbehälter\" as per the context. So the answer is the catch container (Auffangbehälter). Therefore, the answer is \"Auffangbehälter\" or \"catch container.\" But the question is in English, so the answer should be in English.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the sound level in dB of a Tractor plus a spreading spreader (Kali 60) with the rear window opened.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has several rows with different configurations and their corresponding dB values. Let me scan through each line.\n\nLooking at row 3: \"Schlepper + arbeitender, leerer Streuer (dB)\" which translates to Tractor + working, empty spreader. The dB values are 71.9 and 82.3. But the question mentions a spreading spreader (Kali 60), so maybe that's different. \n\nRow 4: \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\" with values 73.8 and 84.6. That seems relevant because it specifies Kali 60. But the question mentions the rear window being opened. \n\nLooking at row 2: \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" with 71.9 and 76.2. The note says \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" which is rear window opened. Wait, row 2's description is \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" but the note says \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" under row 2. Wait, the context has row 2 as \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" with values 71.9 and 76.2. Then row 1 is \"Lärmpegel\" (noise level) with \"Kabine geschlossen\" (cab closed) and \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" (rear window open). \n\nWait, maybe the columns are for different conditions. Let me check the structure again. The context seems to have columns labeled 0, 1, 2. For example, row 2 has \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" with values 71.9 and 76.2. Then row 1 is \"Lärmpegel\" with \"Kabine geschlossen\" and \"Heckfenster geöffnet\". So maybe column 0 is \"Kabine geschlossen\" (cab closed), column 1 is \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" (rear window open), and column 2 might be another condition? Wait, the first line after the table might be row 0, but the context is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nLooking at the context:\n\nRow 0: \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" with 71.9 and 76.2. Then row 1: \"Schlepper + arbeitender, leerer Streuer (dB)\" with 71.9 and 82.3. Row 2: \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\" with 73.8 and 84.6. Row 3: same as row 2? Wait, there's a duplicate row 4? Maybe a typo. Then row 5: \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB)\" with 73.0 and 87.2. \n\nThen row 6: \"Verschiedenes\" and so on. \n\nBut the key is to find the sound level for \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60)\" with rear window opened. \n\nLooking at row 2: \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\" which is the tractor plus spreading spreader (Kali 60). The dB values are 73.8 and 84.6. Now, the question is about the rear window being opened. \n\nLooking at row 1: \"Lärmpegel\" (noise level) with \"Kabine geschlossen\" (cab closed) and \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" (rear window open). So the columns might be for different conditions. For example, column 0 is \"Kabine geschlossen\" (cab closed), column 1 is \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" (rear window open), and column 2 might be another condition. \n\nSo for row 2, which is \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\", the values are 73.8 (column 0) and 84.6 (column 1). Wait, but the first value is 73.8 and the second is 84.6. If column 0 is \"Kabine geschlossen\" and column",

Scanning through the text, I see section 4 labeled \"Zustand Schaufeln\" which translates to \"Condition of the vanes.\" \n\nNow, the question is about the inspection interval. The context mentions various intervals for different maintenance tasks. For example, section 1 talks about checking screws and nuts after the first hour and then weekly. But for the vanes, I need to check if there's a specific interval mentioned. \n\nLooking at the entries under \"Zustand Schaufeln,\" there's a line that says \"·\" followed by a page number 43. However, the actual interval details aren't explicitly stated here. The other sections have more detailed instructions, like \"nach der ersten Betriebsstunde\" (after the first hour) and \"regelmäßig (mindestens wöchentlich)\" (regularly, at least weekly). But for the vanes, the only mention is the page number without a specific interval. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide a specific interval for the vanes beyond the page reference, the answer would be that the information isn't found.

The context has several bullet points with instructions. Let me go through each one.\n\nThe first few points mention checking the dosing level, nozzle point, height and angle of the spreader, and the rotational speed. Then there's a part about placing the container horizontally and spacing. Further down, there's a mention of checking the position of the dosing mechanism relative to the agitator shaft, ensuring equal distance on all sides. \n\nLooking for specific intervals, I see a line that says \"Kontrollieren Sie nochmals die Höhe und passen Sie diese ggf. an.\" which translates to \"Check the height again and adjust if necessary.\" But that's a one-time check, not an interval. \n\nAnother part says \"Lassen Sie den Dosiermechanismus sacken...\" which is about adjusting the dosing mechanism, but again, no interval mentioned. \n\nWait, there's a line that says \"Kontrollieren Sie die Position des Dosiermechanismus...\" which is about checking the position, but again, no frequency. \n\nLooking at the numbered sections, section 5 is about checking and adjusting the dosing mechanism, but the context doesn't specify how often this should be done.

The user is asking for the torque in Nm required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a friction coefficient of 0.13.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information. The context has several lines with different bolt sizes, qualities, friction coefficients, and corresponding torque values. \n\nLooking at the lines, there's a section that mentions \"Anzugsmomente 10.9 0,13\" which translates to torque for 10.9 quality with 0.13 friction. But wait, the numbers around it might be the actual torque values. Let me check the context again.\n\nWait, the context has lines like \"Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,10. Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,13.\" So for 10.9 quality, there are entries for 0.10 and 0.13 friction. But where are the actual torque values? The initial lines have numbers like 9 M22 170 200 etc., but those might be for different sizes. \n\nWait, the line with M5 has values like 3.6, 5.7, 7, etc. But the user is asking about M18. Let me check if there's a line for M18. Scanning through the context, I see lines for M5, M22, M24. Wait, maybe the numbers in the first lines are the torque values for different bolt sizes. For example, the first line starts with 9 M22 followed by numbers. Maybe those numbers are the torque values for M22 bolts. But the user is asking about M18. \n\nWait, the context might have a table where the first column is the bolt size, then the numbers are torque values for different qualities and frictions. But the formatting is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.\n\nLooking at the line starting with 0 M5 3.6 5.7 7 4.8 7.6 9.4. This seems like M5 bolts with different qualities and frictions. For example, 3.6 might be for a certain friction, then 5.7 for another, etc. But the exact mapping isn't clear. \n\nThen there's a line with \"Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,10. Anzugsmomente.10.9.0,13.\" which might indicate that for 10.9 quality, the torque values are 0.10 and 0.13. But where are the actual numbers? Maybe the numbers in the earlier lines correspond to different bolt sizes. For example, the line starting with 9 M22 170 200 470 560 670 800 780 930. Maybe these are torque values for M22 bolts with different qualities and frictions. But how to map them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers after the bolt size are the torque values for different friction coefficients. For example, the line starting with 0 M5 3.6 5.7 7 4.8 7.6 9.4 could be for M5 bolts with different qualities and frictions. But without clear headers, it's challenging. \n\nWait, the user is asking about M18. The context doesn't have a line for M18. The lines are for M5, M22, M24. So maybe the answer is that the torque for M18 isn't listed in the context. But the user might have made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the first lines are for different qualities. For example, the line starting with 9 M22 170 200 470 560 670 800 780 930. If the first number is the bolt size, then the next numbers could be for different qualities. But without clear labels, it's hard to tell. \n\nSince the user is asking for M18, and the context doesn't have a line for M18, the answer would be that it's not found. However, maybe there's a line I missed. Let me check again. The context has lines for M5, M22, M24. No M18.

But how do these numbers map to the quality and friction coefficients?\n\nWait, the initial lines mention \"Qualität.Reibung *.Gewinde Anzugsmomente.70 (A2).0.10.\" So maybe the first part is the quality (70 A2), then the friction coefficient (0.10), and then the torque values.

For example, \"Anzugsmomente.70 (A2).0.10\" might mean that for a 70 (A2) quality with a friction coefficient of 0.10, the torque is 3.6 Nm for M5. Then the next numbers would be for 0.20 and 0.30.

It says that for medium working widths with a triangular spread pattern, deviations in overlap are less serious. However, the specific mention of small gardens is in the context of avoiding driving errors, not directly about the suitability of one-sided boundary spreading. \n\nWait, the context doesn't explicitly state whether one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens. It talks about optimizing the spread pattern and reducing environmental impact, but there's no direct mention of small gardens in relation to the one-sided method. The answer should be based solely on the context provided. Since the context doesn't address small gardens specifically regarding one-sided boundary spreading, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The context is in German, so I need to be careful with the terms. The main topic seems to be about connecting the IsoMatch Tellus GO control panel to a tractor, mentioning different cables and connections. \n\nLooking at the text, there's a part that says: \"Die sonstigen Anschlüsse verlaufen über den standardmäßig mitgelieferten 'Input IM Tellus' Kabelsatz.\" Translating that, it means \"The other connections run through the standardly included 'Input IM Tellus' cable set.\" So, the Input IM Tellus cable is used for other connections besides the main ones. \n\nThen, later in the context, there's a section titled \"Input IM Tellus mit ISO11786 'In Cab' Anschluss\" which mentions that the standard delivery includes a connection set for ISO 11786 'In Cab', lighting and ignition lock, tractor CAN (optional specific connector needed), and video input. Wait, but the question is about other connections besides the main ones. The main connection here is the ISO 11786 'In Cab' via the 9-polig cable. The other connections are handled by the Input IM Tellus cable. \n\nSo, the Input IM Tellus cable is used for the other connections, which according to the context are: lighting and ignition lock, tractor CAN (with optional connector), and video input. The answer should list these. But the question is asking for \"other kind of connections\" that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for. The context says that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for these other connections. \n\nWait, the first part says that if the tractor has a full ISOBUS connection, the 9-polig cable is used. The other connections are via the Input IM Tellus cable. Then, in the section about the standard delivery, it lists ISO 11786 'In Cab', lighting and ignition lock, tractor CAN (optional), and video input. But the Input IM Tellus cable is used for the other connections, which would be the ones not covered by the ISOBUS. So the other connections are lighting and ignition lock, tractor CAN (optional), and video input. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for lighting and ignition lock, tractor CAN (optional), and video input. But the question is phrased as \"other kind of connections,\" so the answer should list those. The exact answer from the context is that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for these other connections.

The context provided is in German, so I need to parse through it carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for sections that mention stopping work or related actions. The context has several points. Let me go through each part.\n\nThe first paragraph talks about preventing the tractor from being started while someone is working on the machine to avoid injuries. That's about safety during operation, not stopping work.\n\nNext, there's a list of things to do before going on public roads: checking the tractor and machine against traffic regulations, inspecting lights, warning devices, brakes, and ensuring the reflector isn't covered. These are pre-transport checks, not specifically stopping work.\n\nThen there's a part about not staying on the machine during operations and only allowing it when the machine is stopped and secured against rolling. This seems relevant. It mentions that people must not stay on the machine unless it's stopped and secured. So when stopping work, securing the machine against rolling is a key measure.\n\nAnother section talks about keeping the machine's protection intact, like guards and covers, to prevent access to danger zones. This is about safety during operation, not stopping work.\n\nThe part about not exceeding the maximum height for vehicles and other overhead obstacles is about transport safety, not stopping work.\n\nFinally, before leaving the tractor, the Zapfwelle (probably a coupling or drive shaft) must be turned off. This is a specific action when stopping work, ensuring the machine is secured.\n\nPutting this together, the key measures when stopping work are securing the machine against rolling and turning off the drive shaft. The answer should mention both actions. Let me check the exact wording in the context.\n\nThe relevant sentences are: \"Nur bei einer still stehenden Maschine, die gegen Wegrollen gesichert ist, dürfen Sie sich auf den dafür bestimmten Plätzen auf der Maschine aufhalten.\" and \"Bevor Sie den Schlepper verlassen, müssen Sie: · die Zapfwelle ausschalten,\"\n\nSo the measures are securing against rolling and turning off the drive shaft. The answer should list both. The user wants a precise, concise answer. The answer format should be in English, as per instructions.

The context mentions that these blocks can form and cause clogging, but it doesn't explain the underlying reason why they attract water. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the reason, but the context only states that they attract water, not why. The answer needs to be based strictly on the context. Since the context doesn't provide a cause for why they attract water, just that they do, the correct response would be that the context doesn't specify the reason. However, the user's instruction says to base the answer on the context. If the context doesn't mention the reason, then the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n\nBut wait, looking again, the context says \"Die meisten Sorten Kunstdünger ziehen Wasser an und können dann große Brocken bilden.\" So the context states that they attract water, but the reason isn't given. The question is why they attract water. Since the context doesn't explain the cause, the answer should be that it's not found in the context. However, the user's instructions say to answer based on the context. If the context doesn't provide the reason, then the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n\nBut maybe the answer is that they attract water because they are hygroscopic? Wait, but the context doesn't mention hygroscopic properties. The context only states that they attract water, leading to blockages. Since the reason isn't given, the answer should be that it's not found in the context. However, the user's instructions say to answer based on the context. If the context doesn't explain why, then the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n\nWait, the user's question is \"Why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" The context says \"Die meisten Sorten Kunstdünger ziehen Wasser an...\" which is a statement of fact, but not the reason.

The context mentions that if the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushings are damaged, the disturbance was probably caused by a hard object. It also says the mixer might be damaged too. The key sentence here is: \"Wenn Sie feststellen sollten, dass die Schaufeln, die Streuscheibe oder die Auslaufrohre beschädigt sind, dann wurde die Störung höchstwahrscheinlich durch einen harten Gegenstand verursacht.\" Translating that, it means if those parts are damaged, the disturbance was most likely caused by a hard object. \n\nSo the answer should directly state that the damage is caused by a hard object based on the context.

However, the material of the coupling support isn't specified here. The only material mentioned related to the coupling is the stainless steel clamps used during installation. \n\nSince the question specifically asks about the 'hose coupling support' and the context doesn't mention its material, the answer should be that it's not found in the context. The user might be confusing the clamps with the support structure. Therefore, the correct response is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\".\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The context talks about the diameter of fertilizer granules and their distribution. There's a part that mentions if 20% or more of the granules are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal to distribute them, but it can cause damage. Another part says if 10% or more are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to distribute, leading to less optimal distribution and damage. \n\nWait, the question is about preventing blockage.

The second point mentions if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal but can cause damage. The third point says if 10% or more are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to distribute. \n\nBut the question is about the maximum chunk size to prevent blockage.

But the user is asking about blockage, not damage. The tip about cleaning sieves to prevent blockage might imply that larger granules could cause blockages. However, the exact maximum size isn't directly stated. \n\nWait, the first point says if 80-100% are between 2.0-4.75 mm, it's easy to distribute. So maybe the maximum size for easy distribution is 4.75 mm. But the question is about preventing blockage. If the granules are larger than 4.75 mm, they might cause blockages. However, the context says that if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal to distribute but can cause damage. So maybe the maximum acceptable size to prevent blockage is 4.75 mm.

Alternatively, the context doesn't mention a specific maximum size for blockage, so the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the user might expect 4.75 mm as the threshold. Let me check again. The first point says if 80-100% are between 2.0-4.75 mm, it's easy to distribute. So maybe the maximum size for easy distribution is 4.75 mm. If the granules are larger than that, they might cause issues. But the question is about blockage. The context doesn't explicitly link blockage to a specific size. The tip about cleaning sieves to prevent blockage might imply that larger granules could cause blockages, but the exact maximum isn't given.

Then, it instructs to set the Scheibenhöhe to 75 cm above the ground or the crop before spreading. \n\nThe key part here is the specific number 75 cm.

The context is in German, so I'll need to parse it carefully. Let me go through each point.\n\nThe first bullet mentions that if you drive at the same speed as normal pump speed, the dose isn't reduced. But if you don't, the dose is reduced by 25%. Wait, that's about the dose reduction, not speed. \n\nNext, there's a part about border spreading with a border spread plate. It says that with the border spread plate and closed dosing unit, you can fill half the spread pattern to 100% along the parcel boundary. Then it mentions adjusting the border spread plate to optimize the spread pattern and reduce environmental impact. \n\nThen there's a section about the first pass: keeping speed and pump speed the same. The evaluation part says that in the middle tanks, the dose is lower, leading to a pattern like in figure B. The cause is lower pump speed. For border spreading, the level in the middle test tubes should be 25% less than the outer ones. \n\nAdjustment: If the deviation is more than 25%, increase the spread disc speed by 50 RPM. \n\nWait, the question is about speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate. The context mentions that if the deviation is more than 25%, you need to adjust the speed. But the exact percentage related to speed reduction isn't directly stated. However, the part about the middle test tubes being 25% less than the outer ones might relate to the application rate. \n\nBut the question is about speed reduction. The initial instruction says that if you don't match the speed, the dose is reduced by 25%. But that's when you're not driving at the same speed as normal. However, during border spreading, the context mentions that the middle test tubes should be 25% less. So maybe the speed reduction is 25%? Wait, the answer might be 25% reduction in speed. But the context says that if you don't match the speed, the dose is reduced by 25%. So to compensate, maybe you need to reduce speed by 25%? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the first bullet says: \"Wählen Sie einen solchen Gang, dass Sie mit derselben Geschwindigkeit fahren wie bei normaler Zapfwellendrehzahl, oder die Dosis wird um 25 % reduziert.\" Translating that: Choose a gear so that you drive at the same speed as normal pump speed, or the dose is reduced by 25%. So if you don't match the speed, the dose is reduced by 25%. Therefore, to compensate for the application rate, you might need to adjust the speed. But the question is about the optimal speed reduction percentage during border spreading. \n\nWait, the part about border spreading mentions that the middle test tubes should be 25% less than the outer ones. That's about the application rate, not speed. The adjustment part says if the deviation is more than 25%, increase the spread disc speed by 50 RPM. So maybe the speed adjustment is 50 RPM, but the question is about percentage. \n\nAlternatively, the initial instruction says that if you don't match the speed, the dose is reduced by 25%. So to compensate, you might need to reduce speed by 25%? But the question is about the optimal speed reduction percentage during border spreading. \n\nWait, the answer might be 25% reduction in speed. Because the first bullet says that if you don't match the speed, the dose is reduced by 25%. So to compensate, you need to reduce speed by 25%? Or is it the other way around? \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be 25% reduction in speed. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. The only mention of percentage is 25% reduction in dose if speed isn't matched. The question is about speed reduction percentage to compensate for application rate. \n\nHmm. The answer might be 25% reduction in speed. But I need to check again. The first bullet says that if you don't drive at the same speed as normal, the dose is reduced by 25%. So to maintain the application rate, you need to adjust speed. But the question is about the optimal speed reduction percentage during border spreading. \n\nWait, the context mentions that during border spreading, the middle test tubes should be 25% less than the outer ones. That's about the application rate. The adjustment part says if the deviation is more than 25%, increase the spread disc speed by 50 RPM. So maybe the speed adjustment is 50 RPM,",

It says, \"Parken Sie die Maschine auf den Abstellrädern nur, wenn der Behälter leer ist!\" which translates to parking the machine on the parking wheels only when the container is empty. Then it mentions that parking with a filled container leads to reduced stability and that the wheels aren't designed for heavy loads, risking damage and injury.\n\nHowever, the question is about a 10-degree slope. The context doesn't explicitly mention anything about slopes or angles. The key points here are about the container being empty and stability, but there's no specific information regarding the maximum slope angle the parking wheels can handle. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide details on slope resistance or angles, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions.

The user is asking about the valve type and manufacturer used for the 'valve set' that comes with the hopper empty sensor.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of a valve set related to the hopper empty sensor. The context has several sections. Let me scan through each part.\n\nUnder the \"Zubehör\" section, there's a mention of \"Behälter leer Sensor\" which is the hopper empty sensor. It says the sensor is always included with the Ablass-Set. The term \"Ablass-Set\" translates to \"discharge set\" or \"valve set.\" So the valve set is the Ablass-Set.\n\nNow, looking for the manufacturer. The context mentions \"ExactLine\" and \"GEOCONTROL\" in different sections. However, the Ablass-Set is mentioned in the context of the hopper empty sensor. The exact line where it's mentioned is: \"Der Sensor wird immer mit dem Ablass-Set geliefert.\" This translates to \"The sensor is always supplied with the Ablass-Set.\" \n\nBut the context doesn't explicitly state the manufacturer of the Ablass-Set. The manufacturer might be inferred from other parts. For example, \"ExactLine\" is mentioned in the context, possibly as a product line. However, the question is about the valve set that comes with the sensor. Since the sensor is part of the ExactLine system, maybe the Ablass-Set is also from ExactLine. However, the context doesn't directly link the Ablass-Set to a manufacturer. \n\nWait, looking again, the context has \"ExactLine\" listed as a product, and \"GEOCONTROL\" as another. The Ablass-Set is mentioned in the context of the hopper empty sensor. Since the sensor is part of the ExactLine system, it's possible that the Ablass-Set is also from ExactLine. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that. The answer needs to be based strictly on the context. Since there's no direct mention of the manufacturer for the Ablass-Set, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, the user is asking for the valve type and manufacturer. The valve set is called Ablass-Set, but the manufacturer isn't specified. Therefore, the answer would be that the manufacturer isn't mentioned. However, the question might be expecting the manufacturer to be ExactLine since that's the product line mentioned. But without explicit information, the correct answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any relevant information.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a lot of technical steps about setting up a dosing system, calculating flow rates, and performing tests. The key numbers mentioned are 9 kg/min and 27 kg/min, which are related to the required throughput. There's also a mention of multiplying by 3, which connects to the dosing position calculation. However, the question is about the drain rate in liters per minute for the drain kit during hopper emptying.\n\nWait, the context doesn't mention anything about liters or a drain kit specifically. The terms used are \"Durchsatz\" which is throughput or flow rate, measured in kg/min. There's no conversion to liters provided here. The user is asking for liters per minute, but the context only has kg/min. Since there's no information about the density of the material or a conversion factor from kg to liters, I can't determine the drain rate in liters per minute. The context doesn't provide that specific data. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of materials used for the hopper cover.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several mentions of \"Abdeckplane\" which translates to cover or shield. The text says the Abdeckplane protects the fertilizer from moisture and dirt. It also mentions that the plane is hinged for a large fill opening and can be electrically operated. However, there's no specific mention of the material used for the cover. \n\nThe question refers to \"sail\" material, which might be a translation of \"Abdeckplane\" or another term. But the context doesn't specify the material. There's a mention of \"Kunstdünger\" which is artificial fertilizer, but that's the content being protected, not the material of the cover. \n\nThe user is asking about UV resistance, which isn't addressed in the context either. The text talks about protection from moisture and dirt, but not UV resistance.
