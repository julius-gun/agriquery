It mentions that the spreading pattern for area fertilization is completely overlapped, which translates to 100% overlap. The text says, \"Das Streubild bei Flächendüngung wird zu 100 % überlappt\" which directly states the overlap percentage. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions of overlap in other pages. On page 29, there's talk about the ExactLine and minimizing loss over the field edge, but that's about reducing loss, not the overlap percentage. Page 27 mentions overlapping in the context of multi-rate, but that's about different rates, not the overlap percentage. \n\nSo the key sentence is on page 28, stating that the spreading pattern for area fertilization is 100% overlapped.

The computer compares this with the set dose and adjusts the dosing unit. \n\nAnother mention is on Page 31, where it talks about the \"Referenzsensor\" (reference sensor) used to correct measurements affected by factors like slope or vibrations. But the main system here is the automatic weighing system.\n\nSo the answer should be the \"automatisches Wiegesystem\" or in English, \"Automatic Weighing System.\" The context directly states that this system continuously measures the fertilizer quantity. I need to make sure there's no other system mentioned. Pages 30 and 31 discuss this, and other pages talk about different features like ExactLine or ISO systems, but not the measuring system. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is the automatic weighing system.\n</think>\n\n[Answer]  \nThe automatic weighing system continuously measures the fertilizer quantity being spread.",

The relevant part says: \"Wenn der Behälterinhalt unter 100 kg beträgt, schaltet das Bediensystem die automatische Kalibrierung aus.\" This translates to when the container content is under 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration. But this doesn't directly answer the frequency; it's about when it's disabled.\n\nLooking further, in the same page, there's a mention of \"automatische Abdrehprobe\" which is automatic calibration tests. The text states: \"die automatischen Abdrehtests, die der Streuer alle 75 kg oder jede Minute ausführt.\" So the spreader performs these tests every 75 kg or each minute. That seems to be the key point. \n\nWait, the question is about how often the calibration tests are done. The context says the spreader does these tests every 75 kg or every minute. So the answer should be every 75 kg or every minute. Let me check if there's any other mention. On page 31, the part about the reference sensor and the calibration being disabled when the container is under 100 kg is about when the system is active, but the frequency is specified as 75 kg or each minute. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the spreader carries out automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or every minute.

The context says the sensor is part of the hydraulic border spreading plate's setup. \n\nSo the precise answer is that the position sensor should be connected to the electronic box on the spreader. The exact phrase from the context is \"an den Kasten mit Elektronik auf dem Streuer an.\" Therefore, the answer is the electronic box on the spreader.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nThe position sensor for the hydraulic border spreading plate should be connected to the electronic box on the spreader.",

The text mentions that you should stay away from the machine until all moving parts have completely stopped. Contact with a running machine can cause serious or fatal injuries.\n\nSo the danger here is the continued rotation of the machine parts due to inertia. The reason is the mass inertia, which keeps the machine moving even after the PTO is disengaged. The answer needs to be precise and directly from the context. The exact sentence from the context is: \"Nach dem Ausschalten der Zapfwelle kann Gefahr durch das Nachdrehen der Maschine aufgrund ihre Massenträgheit entstehen.\" Translating that, it's about the machine continuing to rotate due to its mass inertia.

The user is asking about the pattern of the type 'mineral' based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the 'mineral' type is discussed. Looking through the context, on Page 58, there's a table listing different Düngemitteltypen (fertilizer types) with their characteristics. The entry for 'Mineralisch' (which translates to 'Mineral' in English) is listed under the 'Form' and 'Oberfläche' (surface) categories.\n\nIn the table, under the 'Form' column for 'Mineralisch', it says \"eckig, mit scharfen Kanten und Rändern\" which means \"angular, with sharp edges and corners\". The 'Oberfläche' column for the same entry states \"sehr rau\" meaning \"very rough\".\n\nThe question is about the pattern of the 'mineral' type. The term 'pattern' here likely refers to the physical characteristics or structure. The context doesn't mention any specific pattern like a design or arrangement, but rather describes the shape and surface. Since the user might be referring to the physical form, the answer should focus on the shape and surface details provided.\n\nThe answer needs to be precise and concise, directly from the context. The key points are the shape being angular with sharp edges and the surface being very rough. There's no mention of a pattern in the sense of a repeating design, so the answer should reflect the physical attributes described.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern of the 'mineral' type is described as angular with sharp edges and corners, and a very rough surface.",

The value here is 71.9 dB. But the question specifies \"Kali 60\" and the rear window opened. \n\nLooking further, line 4 is \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\" which is the tractor plus the spreading spreader (Kali 60). The value here is 73.8 dB. However, the question mentions the rear window being opened. \n\nWait, line 2 mentions \"Kabine geschlossen\" (cab closed) and line 3 says \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" (rear window opened). Wait, no, looking again: line 2 is \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" with values 71.9 and 76.2. Then line 3 is \"Schlepper + arbeitender, leerer Streuer (dB)\" with 71.9 and 82.3. Line 4 is \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\" with 73.8 and 84.6. Line 5 is \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) + ExactLine (dB)\" with 73.0 and 87.2. \n\nWait, the columns are labeled 0, 1, 2.

But the exact data for the question is in line 4, which is \"Schlepper + streuender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\" with values 73.8 and 84.6. The first value (73.8) is probably for the cab closed, and the second (84.6) for the rear window opened. \n\nSo the answer should be 84.6 dB when the rear window is opened. Let me confirm. The question specifies \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60)\" which matches line 4. The rear window opened is mentioned in line 3 as \"Heckfenster geöffnet\" but wait, line 3 is \"Schlepper + arbeitender, leerer Streuer (dB)\" which is tractor plus empty spreader.

The context provided is a manual for machine maintenance, so I need to look through the pages mentioned.\n\nFirst, I'll check the sections related to maintenance intervals. On page 125, there's a section titled \"Wartungsintervalle\" (Maintenance Intervals). Looking at the table, each row has a number and a description. The entry for number 4 says \"Zustand Rührer und Rührerwelle\" which translates to \"Condition of the agitator and agitator shaft.\" Wait, the question is about vanes, which might be part of the agitator. But the user specifically mentions \"vanes,\" which are typically part of a spreader or similar machinery. \n\nLooking further, on page 125, entry number 4 is about the agitator and its shaft. However, the question is about vanes, which might be the \"Schaufeln\" mentioned in entry 4. Wait, entry 4 is \"Zustand Rührer und Rührerwelle\" (Condition of the agitator and agitator shaft), and entry 43 is \"Zustand Schaufeln\" (Condition of the blades or vanes). Wait, looking back, entry 43 is listed under \"Zustand Schaufeln\" which directly refers to vanes. \n\nIn the maintenance intervals table, entry 43 is listed under the \"täglich\" (daily) column. Wait, no. Let me check again. The table on page 125 has columns for \"täglich\" (daily), \"nach der ersten 10 Betriebsstunden\" (after the first 10 hours of operation), \"nach jeweils 100 Stunden\" (after every 100 hours), \"min. 1x pro Jahr\" (at least once per year), and \"Seite\" (page). \n\nLooking at the entries, entry 4 is \"Zustand Rührer und Rührerwelle\" which is under the \"täglich\" column.

Wait, the table might have some formatting issues. Let me parse the table again.\n\nThe table on page 125 has entries numbered 0 to 23. The columns are: \"täglich\", \"nach der ersten 10 Betriebsstunden\", \"nach jeweils 100 Stunden\", \"min. 1x pro Jahr\", and \"Seite\". \n\nLooking at entry 4: \"Zustand Rührer und Rührerwelle\" is under the \"täglich\" column. Entry 43 is listed as \"Zustand Schaufeln\" which is under the \"nach jeweils 100 Stunden\" column. Wait, but the entries are numbered 0-23. Maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the \"Zustand Schaufeln\" is under entry 43, but the numbering might be off. \n\nWait, looking at the context again, the user's question is about the interval for inspecting the vanes. The context mentions \"Zustand Schaufeln\" (Condition of the blades) in the maintenance intervals. The entry for \"Zustand Schaufeln\" is listed under the \"nach jeweils 100 Stunden\" column. Therefore, the answer should be that the vanes must be inspected every 100 hours of operation. \n\nBut I need to confirm. The user's question is about \"vanes,\" which are \"Schaufeln\" in German. The entry for \"Zustand Schaufeln\" is in the maintenance intervals table. The column for \"nach jeweils 100 Stunden\" (after every 100 hours) is the interval.

That translates to \"Seal of the Rührer (agitator) shaft.\" The instruction there says to check the seal's condition and replace it if damaged. \n\nNow, the question is about the replacement interval. The context mentions maintenance intervals on page 125, specifically under \"Wartungsintervalle.\" Looking at the table, entry 21 refers to \"Abdichtung Rührerwelle\" and mentions checking it.

The user is asking for the interval, so if the context doesn't mention a specific time frame, like every X hours or months, then the answer would be that it's not specified. \n\nWait, the instruction says to check the seal's condition regularly. The maintenance intervals might include checking the seal, but the replacement interval isn't explicitly stated. The context doesn't mention a specific interval for replacing the agitator seal, only that it should be checked during maintenance. Therefore, the answer would be that the interval isn't specified in the context. But I need to confirm if there's any mention of replacement frequency. \n\nLooking again, the only mention is under \"Abdichtung Rührerwelle\" on page 125, line 21: \"Kontrollieren Sie auch den Zustand der Schutzrohre und der Sicherungsketten. Ersetzen Sie diese, wenn diese beschädigt sind.\" This translates to checking the condition and replacing if damaged. There's no mention of how often this check should occur.

The entry for 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction coefficient is mentioned. The table lists values for M6. Let me check the exact numbers.\n\nThe table for Edelstahl shows for M6, under 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction, the torque is 9.9 Nm. Wait, let me confirm. The line for M6 under 70 (A2) with 0.2 friction is listed as 9.9 Nm. The other values for 0.10 and 0.30 are 3.6 and 5.7 for 0.10, and 13.2 for 0.30. So the 0.2 value is 9.9 Nm. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of M6 with different parameters. The question specifies M6, 70 (A2), and 0.2 friction. The context's Edelstahl table has exactly that entry. Therefore, the answer should be 9.9 Nm.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n9.9",

The user is asking what they should do if the fertiliser flow is blocked and which page to refer to.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has several pages, 151, 152, 153. The question is about a blocked fertiliser flow, so I should search for mentions of blockage or obstruction in the text.\n\nLooking at Page 151, there's a section about the dosing issue. It mentions that if the flow is blocked, you should clean the machine thoroughly after each use and replace the rotor if it's worn out. The page number here is 118. Wait, but the page number in the context for that part is 151, but the reference to the solution is on page 118? Wait, no, the context might have some formatting issues. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the context, under Page 151, the text says: \"Durchstrom von Kunstdünger wird behin- dert\" which translates to \"The flow of fertiliser is hindered.\" The solution is to clean the machine thoroughly after each use and replace the rotor if it's worn. The page number mentioned here is 118. But the current page is 151. Wait, maybe the page numbers in the context are not correctly aligned. Let me check the exact text.\n\nLooking at the context, under Page 151, the entry for problem 6 says: \"Durchstrom von Kunstdünger wird behin- dert\" (flow of fertiliser is hindered). The solution is \"Nach jedem Gebrauch die Maschine gründ- lich reinigen. Rührer ersetzen, wenn dieser verschlissen ist\" (Clean the machine thoroughly after each use. Replace the rotor if it's worn out). The page number here is 118. Wait, but the page number in the context for that entry is 151. Wait, maybe the page numbers in the context are not correctly formatted. Let me check the exact lines.\n\nLooking at the context:\n\nOn Page 151, the text is:\n\n\"6                           Unrichtige Do- sis (kg pro  Hektar)                                                                                                  Durchstrom von Kunstdünger wird behin- dert                         Nach jedem Gebrauch die Maschine gründ- lich reinigen. Rührer ersetzen, wenn dieser verschlissen  ist        118\"\n\nWait, the \"118\" here is the page number? Or is it part of the text? The line ends with \"ist        118\". So the solution is to clean the machine and replace the rotor if worn, and the page number is 118. But the current page is 151. That seems conflicting. Maybe the page numbers in the context are not correctly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the \"118\" is the page number where the solution is detailed. But the user is asking where to look, so the answer would be page 118. However, the context provided here includes pages 151, 152, 153. Wait, the user's context includes pages 151, 152, 153. But in the text for problem 6 on page 151, the solution refers to page 118. However, the user's context doesn't include page 118. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the \"118\" is part of the text, not the page number. Let me re-examine the exact text.\n\nLooking at the line:\n\n\"6                           Unrichtige Do- sis (kg pro  Hektar)                                                                                                  Durchstrom von Kunstdünger wird behin- dert                         Nach jedem Gebrauch die Maschine gründ- lich reinigen. Rührer ersetzen, wenn dieser verschlissen  ist        118\"\n\nThe \"118\" is at the end of the line. So the solution is to clean the machine and replace the rotor if worn, and the page number is 118. However, the user's context only includes pages 151, 152, 153. So if the answer refers to page 118, but that page isn't in the provided context, then the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, maybe the \"118\" is part of the text, not the page number. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"118\" is the page number where the solution is detailed. But since the user's context doesn't include page 118, the answer would be that it's not found",

The exact steps are to stop spreading immediately and turn off the power take-off. Additionally, when filling the spreader during spreading, the automatic calibration must be turned off, but that's more about calibration than stopping the spread.\n\nSo the direct answer should be the steps mentioned on page 101: stop spreading immediately and turn off the power take-off shaft.

The context is in German, so I'll have to parse through the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the pages, there's a lot about the ISO-Bediensystem, ISOBUS communication, and how the IsoMatch system works with different machinery. For example, on Page 30, it mentions that the ISO-Bediensystem uses the ISOBUS communication protocol. But there's no specific mention of different versions of ISOBUS. \n\nOn Page 32, there's a section about ISOBUS-Schlepperanschluss, explaining that ISOBUS handles control functions and data transfer between the terminal and the machine. It also mentions that the ISOBUS communication enables location-based processing and reacting to field conditions. However, again, no specific versions or bandwidth details are given.\n\nThe context also talks about the IsoMatch system working with both ISO and non-ISO tractors, using adapters or cables. There's a mention of RS 232 for GPS signals, but that's more about connectivity than protocol versions.\n\nI don't see any references to different versions of the ISOBUS protocol.

The user is asking how many hours the IsoMatch Tellus can operate continuously before flattening a typical tractor battery if left switched on with the engine off.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any relevant information. The context includes several pages with technical details about the IsoMatch system, its components, and some technical data. \n\nLooking at the pages, there's a mention of the IsoMatch Bedienpult (control panel) and its power consumption. Specifically, on page 34, there's a note that says: \"Bei einer eingeschalteten Einheit können unbeabsichtigt Funktionen aktiviert werden, während Sie sich in der Gefahrenzone befinden. Zudem verbraucht die Bedieneinheit Strom, wodurch der Akku des Schleppers erschöpft werden kann.\" This translates to the control unit consuming power, which can drain the tractor's battery if left on with the engine off. However, the exact number of hours isn't mentioned here.\n\nAnother part of the context on page 32 mentions that the IsoMatch uses a Stromversorgungskabelsatz (power supply cable set) and that the standard cable 'IM Tellus input' is used for other connections. But again, there's no specific information about battery life or operation time.\n\nThe technical data section on page 36 lists some model numbers and capacities, but it's unclear if these relate to battery life. The exact model mentioned is Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD with various numbers, but without more context linking these to battery duration, it's hard to say.\n\nSince the question is about the number of hours before the battery is flattened, and the context doesn't provide any specific figures or calculations related to battery drain time, the answer would have to be that this information isn't present in the given text.

The context is in German, so I need to be careful with the terms. \n\nLooking at Page 73, there's a section about working before spreading and mentions that most fertilizer types attract water and can form large chunks, which can clog the spreader or disrupt the spread pattern. The key part here is \"große Brocken\" which translates to \"large chunks.\" The text advises working with a closed cover on wet days and not to spread without the cover when it's wet. It also says to avoid leaving fertilizer in the spreader for too long because moisture can cause chunks. However, the exact maximum size isn't specified here.\n\nMoving to Page 74, there's a section about filling the machine and mentions that if the distance between the container edge and the ground is more than 1250 mm, you need to use the loading platform. But this is about distance, not chunk size. \n\nOn Page 75, there's a note about not exceeding the allowable total weight and mentions that the machine's design isn't for additional load.

The user is asking about the distance tolerance in meters from the field edge when driving the 'first path' for border spreading. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The context is in German, so I'll need to parse through the text carefully. The relevant sections are on pages 108 and 109, discussing the \"Fahrmuster\" (driving patterns) for border spreading.\n\nLooking at the \"Arbeiten aus Streuspuren heraus (Situation A)\" section on page 109, it mentions that when working from the spreader tracks (Situation A), the tractor should be driven in first gear with the middle of the tractor maintaining an approximate distance of 2 meters from the field edge. The Zapfwellendrehzahl (spindle speed) is reduced to 75% here. \n\nThe question is about the distance tolerance during the 'first path' for border spreading. The key phrase here is \"Mitte des Schleppers einen Abstand von ungefähr 2 Metern zum Feldrand aufweist\" which translates to the middle of the tractor having an approximate distance of 2 meters from the field edge. \n\nI need to confirm if this 2 meters is the tolerance or the required distance. The context states \"ungefähr 2 Metern\" which means approximately 2 meters. Since the question asks for the distance tolerance, the answer is 2 meters. \n\nOther sections mention different distances, like in Situation B where the second pass is done with a 1/2 X meter distance, but that's for a different scenario. The first path in Situation A is specifically 2 meters. \n\nNo other parts of the context mention a different distance for the first path. Therefore, the answer should be 2 meters.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n2 meters",

I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mentions of the GEOCONTROL software and the test period. Looking at the context, there's a section about the IsoMatch Shop and the GEOCONTROL software. The relevant part says: \"Über den IsoMatch Shop können Sie eine Nutzungslizenz erwerben, die ihre Maschine nach Ablauf des Gratistestzeitraums arbeiten lässt mit...\" which translates to \"Through the IsoMatch Shop, you can purchase a usage license that allows your machine to operate after the free test period has expired.\"\n\nWait, but the question is about the duration of the free test period. The context mentions the free test period, but does it specify how many days? Let me check again. The text says \"nach Ablauf des Gratistestzeitraums\" which means \"after the end of the free test period.\" However, the context doesn't state the exact number of days for the test period. It only mentions that the license allows the machine to work after the test period ends. There's no specific duration provided in the context. \n\nSince the question asks for the duration in days and the context doesn't specify any number, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" The user might have expected a specific number, but based on the given text, there's no mention of how many days the free test period lasts. Therefore, the correct response is that the information isn't present in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking about the valve type and manufacturer for the 'valve set' that comes with the hopper empty sensor.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of a valve set related to the hopper empty sensor. Let me scan through the pages.\n\nLooking at Page 148, there's a section about the \"Behälter leer Sensor\" (Hopper Empty Sensor). It mentions that the sensor comes with an \"Ablass-Set\" (Discharge Set). The text says, \"Der Sensor wird immer mit dem Ablass-Set geliefert.\" So the sensor comes with the discharge set. \n\nNow, the question is about the valve type and manufacturer. However, in the context provided, there's no specific mention of a valve type or manufacturer related to the Ablass-Set. The context talks about the sensor and the discharge set, but doesn't detail the valve's type or brand. \n\nOther sections mention various components like the IsoMatch Griff, IsoMatch Eye, ExactLine, etc., but none of those relate to a valve set associated with the hopper empty sensor. The Ablass-Set is mentioned, but without further details on the valve type or manufacturer. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide information on the valve's type or manufacturer, the correct answer would be that this information isn't found in the context. The user might be referring to the Ablass-Set, but without specifics, we can't determine the valve type or manufacturer. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of a drain kit or related terms.\n\nLooking through the pages, the context mainly discusses various attachments and accessories for agricultural machinery, like IsoMatch systems, sensors, and components for spreading fertilizers. There's a section about the \"Behälter leer Sensor\" (Hopper Empty Sensor) which mentions an alarm when the hopper is almost empty, but it doesn't specify a drain rate. \n\nAnother part talks about the \"Ablass-Satz\" (Drain Set), which is available for quick discharge of residual fertilizer. However, the context doesn't mention any specific flow rate or liters per minute. The user is asking for a numerical value, but the provided information doesn't include that. \n\nSince there's no mention of liters per minute or any specific drainage rate in the context, the correct answer would be that the information isn't found.
