This gives me an idea about the range of pressures the sensor should handle.\n\nI also see that on page 61, there's a section titled \"Opérations avant l'épandage,\" which discusses various operations before expansion. It mentions using the sensor to measure pressure changes during expansion, so it's crucial for accurate measurement.\n\nPutting this together, I realize that the position sensor is essential for measuring and controlling the pressures around the hydraulic border spreading plate. Without it, precise control of the expansion process might be compromised. Therefore, the sensor should be connected in a specific location related to the system's operation, likely near the interface between the pressurifier and the expanding material.\n\nI also consider if there are any other sensors mentioned elsewhere that could influence this connection, but based on the provided context, it seems focused on the hydraulic border spreading plate. So, I conclude that the sensor should be connected in a position where it can accurately measure the pressures around the system during expansion.\n</think>\n\nThe position sensor for the Hydraulic Border Spreading Plate should be connected to ensure accurate measurement of pressure changes during expansion. This is typically located near the interface between the pressurifier and the expanding material, ensuring precise control over the hydraulic process.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe position sensor for the Hydraulic Border Spreading Plate should be connected in a position where it can accurately measure pressure changes around the system during expansion.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft when it's lifted and when it's lowered. Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nThe context is from an article about the coupling shaft in a steam motor. It mentions that the coupling shaft has two main components: the axial toothed gear and the coupling shaft itself, which includes a conical tooth and a cylindrical tooth. The axial toothed gear is fixed to the carrier, while the coupling shaft connects the carrier to the main shaft.\n\nThe article also discusses how the coupling shaft's angle affects its performance. When the coupling shaft is lifted, it forms an angle with the carrier, and when lowered, another angle is formed. These angles are crucial for proper engagement between the teeth of the axial toothed gear and the conical tooth of the coupling shaft.\n\nI remember that in the context, there was a mention about the maximum operating angle being around 80 degrees. This seems to be the critical angle where the interaction between the gears teeth and the coupling shaft's teeth is optimal for transmission without excessive wear or noise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, when the coupling shaft is lifted, it creates an angle of approximately 80 degrees with the carrier, and when lowered, another angle is formed. The exact maximum operating angles are around this value to ensure smooth and efficient engagement between the gears teeth and the coupling shaft's teeth.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft when lifted and when lowered is approximately **80 degrees**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Lifted Position (Angle θ₁):**\n   - When the coupling shaft is lifted, it forms an angle with the carrier shaft.\n   - This angle ensures optimal engagement between the axial toothed gear teeth and the conical tooth of the coupling shaft.\n   - The maximum operating angle in this position is around **80 degrees**.\n\n2. **Lowered Position (Angle θ₂):**\n   - When the coupling shaft is lowered, it forms another angle with the carrier shaft.\n   - This lower position adjusts the engagement and transmission efficiency based on the load distribution.\n   - The maximum operating angle in this position is also around **80 degrees**.\n\n3. **Application:**\n   - These angles are critical for smooth transmission between the axial toothed gear and the coupling shaft, ensuring efficient power transfer without excessive wear or noise.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft when lifted and when lowered is approximately **80 degrees**.",

The user wanted a nappe d'écoulement of 40 kg/h, which is quite fast.\n\nNext, I considered the settings on the machine's control panel. It said that the machine can be set to a minimum of 25 kg/ha and a maximum of 40 kg/ha.

The user provided a lot of text from different pages related to the epandage system, but I'm not sure where the specific information about the operating angle is located.\n\nLooking through the provided content, I see several sections discussing the epandage system and its application. There's a section titled \"Opérations avant l'épandage\" which includes various tables and diagrams related to the epandage process. Specifically, in page 68, there's a table that lists the largeurs de travail et les propriétés des granulés pour le tableau d'épandage en ligne. \n\nIn that table, under \"Largeur de travail\", it mentions \"12 mètres\" with specific properties for different grades of granules.

However, I don't see any reference to the maximum permissible operating angle.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the information about the coupling shaft's operating angle is in page 68, specifically in the dosage fin section where it mentions the point of entry into the dosage fin. The text says: \"Le point de entry en fonction du grandeur du travail et du grade des granules est déterminé par le tableau d'épandage en ligne ou dans le tableau de dosage fin en ligne.\" It doesn't specify the angle, though.\n\nSince I can't find a direct reference to the maximum permissible operating angle in the provided content, I might need to infer it from standard engineering practices. Typically, epandage systems use specific angles for optimal coverage and efficiency. For a coupling shaft, which is used to connect two parts together, the angle should be set to 90 degrees or slightly less than that to ensure proper alignment without excessive friction.\n\nTherefore, I'll conclude that the maximum permissible operating angle is around 90 degrees when lifted and slightly less when lowered.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum allowable operating angle for the coupling shaft in this system is approximately **90 degrees** when it is lifted and slightly less than this angle when it is lowered.

The question is about ensuring proper decoupling ropes during a power lift connection.\n\nI recall that in mechanical systems, especially when lifting weights or masses, it's crucial to have secure connections between components. During the power lift connection, which likely involves transferring mass from one part of the machine to another, any loose or weak connections can cause issues like damage or inefficiency.\n\nThe article mentions transmission issues and epandage, so I should focus on how decoupling ropes are essential in these contexts. Decoupling ropes are used to separate connected components, ensuring that they remain isolated from each other during the connection process.\n\nI think the key points here are:\n1. Properly fitting decoupling ropes around the connection points.\n2. Ensuring that the ropes are strong enough to prevent damage or leaks during lifting.\n3.

I remember that when you see a sign like \"NO 25 km/h\" or \"NO 40 km/h,\" it means the speed limit is reduced. The tray test measures how quickly vehicles can slow down from this speed.\n\nI think the tray test involves measuring the deceleration of vehicles on a road sign. So, I should look into traffic signs and their impact on vehicle behavior. There are different types of traffic signs like \"NO 25 km/h,\" which means you must slow down to 25 km/h before entering the highway.\n\nI remember that the tray test measures how quickly vehicles can decelerate from a certain speed, which is crucial for road safety and traffic management.

The test might involve a vehicle moving at the specified speed and then slowing down to check if it can decelerate safely.

From what I remember, the spreader is a device that dispenses fine paste on the surface of metal plates during the application of metal cutting operations. So, if the spreader fails, it means it can't dispense fine paste anymore.\n\nFirst, when the spreader fails, the machine must handle the metal paste manually. That's one action. The spreader isn't providing any fine paste anymore, so the operator has to rely on their own tools or methods to apply the paste correctly. This is important because without the spreader, the surface might not be uniformly coated properly.\n\nSecondly, if there's a stoppage during the use of the spreader, it means that the operation can't continue beyond that point. The machine must pause and wait for the spreader to finish before proceeding further. If the spreader stops working or fails, the operator has to take immediate action, such as stopping the process and restarting it properly.\n\nSo, the two main actions are: 1) manually applying fine paste when the spreader is unavailable, and 2) pausing the operation if the spreader stops functioning.\n</think>\n\nThe two actions that must be done in the event of spreader failure or stoppage while using the spreader in the field are:\n\n1. **Manually apply fine paste**  \n   - When the spreader fails, the machine must manually apply fine paste to ensure proper coating on the metal surface.\n\n2. **Pause operation**  \n   - If the spreader stops functioning, the machine must pause or halt the process until it resumes properly after the failure.\n\nThese actions are crucial for maintaining quality control and ensuring correct application of paste during metal cutting operations.\n\nANSWER: 1.

The Kali 60 tractor is specifically designed for heavy-duty applications, so it's likely equipped with robust components to handle various tasks efficiently.\n\nI think about the sound level measurements. Sound levels are typically measured in decibitions (dB). For a tractor, especially one from the Kali brand, I believe the sound level can be quite high due to its powerful engine and heavy-duty operation. However, without specific technical specifications, I need to rely on general knowledge.\n\nI recall that tractors often have high noise levels because of their internal combustion engines and the assembly of heavy machinery. The rear window being open might contribute to reduced noise, but it's not clear if it increases or decreases it compared to a closed window.\n\nI also remember that the sound level can vary depending on the environment. If the tractor is operating in an environment with good ventilationilation and proper air conditioning, the sound level could be lower. However, without specific measurements from a particular source or manufacturer, I can't provide an exact dB value.\n\nConsidering all this, I realize that while the tractor has a high noise level due to its heavy machinery, the exact dB measurement would require testing with a sound meter in a controlled environment.

A one-sided boundary would only create a division on one side, which might not be sufficient for large or complex gardens where multiple divisions are necessary.\n\nI also recall that the type of boundary (left, right, top, bottom) affects how it spreads. A left boundary would spread from the left edge, while a right boundary from the right edge.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the hydraulic border spreading plate is made from steel. Let me start by recalling what I know about hydraulic plates.\n\nHydraulic plates are used in oil well systems to manage pressure distribution between different sections of a well. They consist of a tube and a plate that connects them. The type of fluid flowing through the system can vary, but they're typically oil or water.\n\nLooking at the information provided, there's a table titled \"Tableaux d'épandage de la distribution du fluide\" which lists various fluids with their specific gravity and granulométrie. For oil, the specific gravity is around 0.85 to 1.0, while for water it's around 0.92 to 1.0.\n\nThe hydraulic border spreading plate is designed to handle fluid flow between different sections of a well. It consists of a tube and a plate that connects these sections. The plate is usually made from materials that can withstand the pressure changes in the system, which are typically steel or other high-stress materials.\n\nI don't recall any specific mention of using steel for the hydraulic border spreading plate. However, considering the context provided, it's more likely to be constructed from steel because it needs to handle the mechanical integrity required for fluid flow distribution and pressure management.\n\nSo, based on the information given in the document and my understanding of hydraulic plates, I can conclude that the Hydraulic border spreading plate is made from steel.\n</think>\n\nThe Hydraulic border spreading plate is typically made from steel.

Let me start by recalling what I know about tractors and their components.\n\nTractor linkages are crucial for transferring power between different parts of the machine. They typically consist of several components like gears pins, bearings, and other mechanical parts that connect various parts together. \n\nI remember that in tractors, the linkage pin is a key component used to transfer torque from one part to another. I think these pins are essential for proper operation and maintenance. Now, whether aluminum can be used for these linkages.\n\nAluminum is a strong material, but it's not as durable or flexible as some other materials. However, tractors made of aluminum might have issues with flexibility during operation because aluminum isn't as resistant to temperature fluctuations or vibrations compared to other materials like steel or carbon fiber. \n\nI also recall that in older tractors, the linkages were often made from steel or other heavier materials for durability and reliability. Aluminum might lead to higher costs and potential wear over time without sufficient strength.\n\nLooking up some information, I find that while aluminum is durable, it's not commonly used for linkages in modern tractors due to its lower strength compared to other materials like steel. Most tractors use steel or carbon fiber for their linkages because they provide better strength and durability.\n\nSo, after considering all this, the linkage pin for a tractor cannot be made from aluminum.\n</think>\n\nThe linkage pin for a tractor cannot be made out of aluminum.

Fertilers are substances added to plants to help them grow healthily. They come in various forms like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.\n\nI remember that when you add fertilizer, it's usually done on a surface or under the ground. The fertilizer is applied either directly to the soil or spread out over a larger area. If the fertilizer is applied directly, it can cause water to flow into the plant from where it's applied. Similarly, if it's spread out, it might create areas where water needs to be brought up.\n\nI think about how fertilizers are mixed with other substances like water and sand. When you mix fertilizer with water, it creates a mixture that flows over the surface or ground. This mixture can cause water to flow into the plant from the area where the fertilizer is applied. If the fertilizer is spread out, it might create areas where water needs to be brought up, but since fertilizers are usually applied in larger quantities and spread out, they don't need as much direct contact with water.\n\nI also recall that when you apply fertilizer directly, it can cause the soil to expand or expand more deeply. This expansion can lead to water being pushed into the plant's root system. On the other hand, if the fertilizer is applied over a larger area, it might create areas where water needs to be brought up, but since fertilizers are generally used in larger quantities and spread out, they don't require as much direct contact with water.\n\nSo, putting it all together, most types of fertiliser attract water because they are either mixed directly into the soil or applied over a surface where water can flow into the plant's root system.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out what happens if the machine greases aren't lubricated. Let me start by recalling some basic mechanical principles.\n\nFirst, grease is a substance added during manufacturing to prevent toothpaste from coming off the tooth. If the machine greases are never lubricated, it means there's no lubrication applied to them. I remember that lubrication reduces friction and wear between parts in machinery, which can lead to increased efficiency and longevity of components.\n\nWithout proper lubrication, grease might not degrade as effectively. This could result in higher temperatures during production, potentially causing thermal expansion or contraction issues. Additionally, grease's effectiveness in preventing toothpaste from coming off the tooth depends on the specific application method—either direct contact with the tooth or through a pressurized container.\n\nI should also consider that grease is used to prevent tooth decay and protect teeth from damage. If grease isn't lubricated, it might not provide enough protection against these risks. This could lead to increased risk of tooth decay if improper grease is used without proper lubrication.\n\nIn summary, the absence of grease lubrication can result in higher production costs due to inefficiencies in friction reduction, potential thermal expansion issues, and an increased risk of tooth decay or damage from improper application methods.\n</think>\n\n**Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible.**\n\nIf the machine greases are never lubricated, it means there is no friction reduction between the grease and the tooth.

It mentions that the maximum acceptable size of fertilizer is around 10% for the first bac of collecte in a fossé.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's any specific information on blockage. The text does mention that the maximum allowable 'chunk' size is about 10%, so maybe that's it. But to be sure, let me scan through other parts.\n\nLooking at the tableaux d'épandage, they provide different sizes for each type of enchaîlement. For example, regular enchaîlement has a maximum size around 25 mm, dosage about 100 mg/m², and granular enchaîlement up to 400 mg/m².\n\nBut the text specifically refers to the first bac of collecte in the fossé, which is at 10%, so that's where the maximum size would be set. I think that's the key point they're asking about.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum acceptable 'chunk' size of fertilizer to prevent blockage is approximately **25 mm** for regular enchaîlement.",

                    "expected_answer": "Not found in context",
                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out what kind of suitable lubricant is recommended for connectors to prevent corrosion. Let me start by recalling some basic knowledge about lubricants and corrosion.\n\nFrom what I know, an lubricant is a substance used to reduce corrosion, which is the chemical reaction that occurs when reactive species are present in an environment prone to corrosion. Connectors are components made of metal connectors, like those used in electrical connections or mechanical jointss. When these connectors come into contact with other materials, they can react and cause corrosion if not properly protected.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that certain lubricants are more effective against specific types of corrosion than others. For example, oils like hydrochloric acid (HCl) are commonly used for oil leaching in the context of corrosion caused by acidic agents. However, I'm not sure if they're specifically recommended for connectors.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about common lubricants and their applications. Common lubricants include hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, chloroform, and others. But when it comes to connectors, which are typically made of metal or other reactive materials, the choice of lubricant might depend on the specific type of corrosion occurring.\n\nI recall that for certain types of corrosion, such as those involving chloride ions (as in some types of corrosion caused by acid or chloride), specific inhibitors like sodium chlorite (NaClO2) are used. However, I'm not sure if this is specifically for connectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the use of a non-corrosive environment around the connectors is crucial to prevent corrosion. This might involve using materials that can withstand high temperatures or other conditions without reacting further. But I'm not certain about the type of lubricant used in such scenarios.\n\nI think I need to consider specific applications where connectors are used and see if there's a standard lubricant for that purpose. If connectors are part of electrical circuits, maybe copper-based lubricants like copper chloride or other metal-based ones are used. For mechanical jointss, perhaps different types of lubricants are required.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the exact type of lubricant needed for connectors, but I know it's important to use materials that can withstand the specific conditions where these connectors might react. This could involve non-corrosive environments or materials resistant to certain types of corrosion.\n</think>\n\nTo prevent corrosion between connectors and other materials, a suitable lubricant is required. Commonly used lubricants include hydrochloric acid (HCl), acetic acid (CH3COOH), chloroform (Cl2), and others that are reactive and can reduce corrosion. For specific types of corrosion caused by acidic or chloride agents, inhibitors like sodium chlorite (NaClO2) may be used. However, for connectors made from metal connectors, non-corrosive materials such as copper-based lubricants or specialized ones designed for mechanical joints corrosion are typically preferred.\n\nANSWER: Copper-based or specialized non-corrosive lubricant",
