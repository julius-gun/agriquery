The user is asking, \"What system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread?\" and they want a precise answer from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context. The context is a manual for a machine that spreads fertilizer, likely a spreader or a similar agricultural machine. The user is looking for a system that measures the amount of fertilizer being spread in real-time.\n\nLooking through the context, there are several sections that mention measurement and control systems. On page 31, there's a section about the \"Système de pesée automatique\" which translates to \"Automatic Weighing System.\" The text explains that the spreader uses sensors to measure the amount of fertilizer spread continuously. It mentions that the computer in the distribution box compares these measurements with the set rate and adjusts the spreader accordingly. \n\nAnother relevant part is on page 31 where it says, \"L'épandeur mesure en continu la quantité d'engrais épandue à l'aide des capteurs de pesée.\" This directly states that the spreader uses weighing sensors to continuously measure the fertilizer quantity. \n\nAdditionally, there's mention of the \"capteurs de pesée\" (weighing sensors) and how they help in adjusting the spread rate. The system is part of the automatic weighing system, which is integrated into the machine's control system. \n\nI need to ensure that the answer is exact and concise. The key terms here are \"système de pesée automatique\" and \"capteurs de pesée.\" The answer should mention the system name and the method (sensors) used. However, the question specifically asks for the system, so the primary answer is the automatic weighing system. \n\nI should check if there's any other system mentioned that could be relevant. For example, the GPS and other control systems are mentioned, but they're more about navigation and positioning rather than measuring the fertilizer quantity. The main system responsible for continuous measurement is the automatic weighing system with sensors. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Système de pesée automatique\" or its English equivalent. However, the user might expect the answer in English. Wait, the instructions say to answer in English. So I need to translate the system name. The context mentions \"Système de pesée automatique\" which is \"Automatic Weighing System.\" \n\nBut looking back, the exact phrase in the context is \"Système de pesée automatique\" on page 31. The answer should be that system. However, the user might want the English term. Let me check the context again. The manual is in French, but the answer should be in English as per the instructions. \n\nWait, the user's question is in English, and the answer should be in English. The context is in French, so I need to translate the system name. The correct term is \"Automatic Weighing System.\" \n\nBut let me confirm. The exact sentence is: \"Le système de commande ISOBUS utilise le protocole de communication ISOBUS...\" but that's about the ISOBUS system. The automatic weighing system is mentioned on page 31. \n\nYes, the answer is the \"Automatic Weighing System\" which uses sensors to measure continuously. The precise answer would be \"Automatic Weighing System\" or \"Système de pesée automatique.\" Since the answer should be in English, the correct term is \"Automatic Weighing System.\" \n\nBut wait, the user might want the exact term from the context. The context says \"Système de pesée automatique\" which translates to \"Automatic Weighing System.\" So the answer is that system. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Automatic Weighing System.\"\n</think>\n\nThe system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread is the **Automatic Weighing System**.",

On page 31, there's a line: \"Test d'étalonnage automatique du débit effectués par l'épandeur tous les 75 kg ou toutes les minutes.\" Oh, here it is! The spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or every minute. So the answer should be every 75 kg or every minute. Let me confirm that this is the exact phrase. Yes, \"tous les 75 kg ou toutes les minutes\" translates to \"every 75 kg or every minute.\" That's the direct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or every minute.  \n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

There are several pages discussing setup, safety, technical specs, and connections.\n\nLooking at the relevant sections, specifically pages 39-42. The question is about transmitting speed when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. From the context, there's a part mentioning that if the tractor isn't ISOBUS, you need an additional wiring harness. The text says: \"Si vous utilisez le boîtier de commande IsoMatch ou un autre boîtier de commande ISOBUS amovible sur un tracteur dépourvu du système de communication ISOBUS, il vous faut impérativement un boîtier électronique ECU.\" Then it mentions connecting the CAN connector to the control box.\n\nWait, but the question is about driving speed transmission. The context mentions that for the IsoMatch Tellus on a non-ISOBUS tractor, you need an additional harness. The exact sentence is: \"Pour utiliser le terminal IsoMatch Tellus sur un tracteur qui n'est pas équipé du système de communication ISOBUS, il vous faut un faisceau de raccordement supplémentaire.\" Then it says that with this harness, you can equip any tractor with a ISOBUS system. \n\nBut how does this relate to transmitting the driving speed? The context also mentions that the speed signal is obtained via the tractor's CAN bus. However, if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, the harness would allow the ISOBUS system to communicate. But the question is specifically about the driving speed transmission. \n\nWait, looking back, there's a part about the speed signal. On page 39, it says: \"Signal de vitesse, de régime de prise de force et GPS sur IsoMatch\" and mentions that if the speed isn't measured on the machine but via the tractor, the speed sensor and cable are connected to the IsoMatch. But that's for when the tractor is ISOBUS. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that when the tractor lacks ISOBUS, you need an additional wiring harness (faisceau de raccordement) to connect the IsoMatch. The exact answer from the context is: \"il vous faut un faisceau de raccordement supplémentaire.\" So the answer is that an additional wiring harness is required. \n\nBut the question is about transmitting the driving speed.

Le régime du disque d'épandage dépend du régime de la prise de force et du point de jonction choisi sur l'arbre de transmission.\" Translating that, it means the machine's working width is mainly determined by the speed of the spreader disk. The disk speed depends on the power take-off speed and the selected coupling point on the transmission shaft.\n\nSo the answer should mention that the working width is determined by the spreader disk's speed, which in turn depends on the power take-off speed and the coupling point on the transmission shaft. I need to make sure I extract the exact information without adding any extra details. Let me check if there's any other mention of working width. On page 14, there's a list of working widths (24, 27/28, etc.), but that's more about the available widths rather than what determines it. The key part is the section on page 46 explaining the factors. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer should state that the working width is determined by the spreader disk's speed, which depends on the power take-off speed and the coupling point on the transmission shaft. I need to present this in English as per the instructions, keeping it concise.\n</think>\n\nThe machine's working width is primarily determined by the spreader disk's speed, which depends on the power take-off speed and the selected coupling point on the transmission shaft.",

The answer should be concise, mentioning placing the machine on a support before working between the tractor and machine.

Scanning through the pages, on page 59, there's a section about granulometry, and then on page 60, there's a mention of determining the specific weight.

Let me check again. On page 60, there's a section about determining the specific weight, which requires a graduated container and a balance. But that's about the tools used, not the parts of the meter. \n\nLooking at page 61, there's a mention of the AutosetApp and the distribution meter's settings. Still no mention of parts. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the granulometer's description. The granulometer has 4 compartments and 7 separators, making a total of 11 parts? But the question is about the distribution meter, not the granulometer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distribution meter has parts mentioned in the setup steps. For example, on page 54, there's a mention of \"chaînes de stabilisation\" (stabilization chains), \"flexibles hydrauliques\" (hydraulic hoses), \"connecteurs électriques\" (electrical connectors), etc. But these are components of the system, not parts of the distribution meter itself. \n\nWait, the question might be referring to the granulometer as part of the distribution meter. If the granulometer has 4 compartments and 7 separators, that's 11 parts. But the context doesn't explicitly state that the distribution meter has these parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the distribution meter has 4 compartments and 7 separators, totaling 11 parts. However, the context doesn't directly state that the distribution meter has these parts. The granulometer is a separate tool provided with the distributor. \n\nSince the context doesn't explicitly mention the number of parts in the distribution meter, the correct answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But I need to check again. \n\nWait, on page 59, the granulometer is described as having 4 small compartments separated by seven others.

Let me check that part again.\n\nThe relevant text says: \"Le système externe et le système de commande de l'épandeur avec boîtier de commande IsoMatch communiquent par le biais d'un port série avec une prise RS232.\" Translating that, it means the external system and the spreader's control system with the IsoMatch control box communicate via a serial port with an RS232 connector. \n\nSo the answer should be RS232. The question is about the type of serial connection, and the context explicitly mentions RS232. I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, I don't see another reference to the serial connection type for IsoMatch. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is RS232.\n</think>\n\nRS232",

The text mentions that if the distance between the hopper's edge and the ground exceeds 1250 mm, a loading platform is needed. However, it doesn't explicitly state the maximum allowed distance.

The key points here are that the system stops automatic calibration when the hopper content is under 100 kg. Also, there's a mention that for very low rates below 50 kg/ha, the minimum hopper content can be lowered to 15 kg for automatic calibration. But the question specifically asks about when it's below 100 kg, so the main point is the automatic calibration being cut off.\n\nI should make sure there's no other mention of hopper content in other pages.

However, the text doesn't specify a replacement interval. The manual might not explicitly state when to replace the seal, only how to check or adjust it. \n\nSince the question is about replacement intervals, and the context doesn't mention a specific interval for replacing the agitator seal, the answer might be that it's not specified here. Alternatively, maybe the answer is inferred from the maintenance intervals. For example, if the seal is part of the hydraulic system, which is checked annually (as mentioned on Page 131), but that's not directly stated. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be that the agitator seal isn't mentioned in the context regarding replacement intervals.

The context has several pages, and the question relates to torque specifications. Looking through the pages, I remember that there's a section discussing torque values for different bolt sizes and qualities. \n\nOn page 129, there's a table for \"Couples de serrage acier\" (Steel Torque Values) which lists torque values for various bolt sizes, qualities, and friction coefficients. The user is asking about a M6 bolt with quality 70 (A2) and friction 0.2. \n\nLooking at the table, for M6, the entry under \"Couples de serrage.70 (A2).0.20\" is 9.9 Nm. The friction coefficient here is 0.20, which matches the user's question. The quality is 70 (A2), which aligns with the bolt's specification. \n\nI should confirm that there's no other mention of M6 with different friction coefficients. The table also includes other friction values like 0.10 and 0.30, but the user specifically asked for 0.2, so 9.9 Nm is the correct value. \n\nNo other parts of the context mention torque values for M6 bolts with these specifications. Therefore, the answer should be 9.9 Nm.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n9.9 Nm",

The problem listed there is \"Débit erroné (kg par hectare)\" which translates to incorrect flow rate. The solution mentions checking if the fertilizer flow is obstructed and advises cleaning the machine thoroughly after each use and replacing the agitator if it's worn. \n\nAnother mention is on Page 153, where problem 6 talks about visible spreading bands due to varying fertilizer quality, but that's more about inconsistent application rather than a blockage. \n\nWait, there's also a part on Page 152 under problem 6: \"La nouvelle partie d'engrais disperse avec les mêmes réglages que la partie précédente. La qualité varie fortement d'une partie à l'autre\" which might relate to inconsistent flow, but not exactly a blockage. \n\nBut the key part is in the troubleshooting section on Page 152, problem 6, which mentions that if the fertilizer flow is blocked, you should clean the machine thoroughly after each use and replace the agitator if it's worn. \n\nSo the answer should direct the user to check the troubleshooting section on Page 152 and follow the cleaning and agitator replacement steps.\n</think>\n\nIf the fertilizer flow is blocked, you should **clean the machine thoroughly after each use** and **replace the agitator if it is worn**.

I need to find the answer in the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of diesel consumption or fuel usage related to the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. The context is in French, so I need to be careful with the terms. \n\nLooking through the pages, most of the content is about safety, maintenance, and technical specifications of the machine. There's a section on \"Apprendre à connaître la machine\" (Learning about the machine) which includes details about the GEOSPREAD system, dosage settings, and spreader operations. However, I don't see any mention of diesel consumption or fuel efficiency here.\n\nI'll check other sections. The \"Sécurité\" (Safety) pages discuss operational safety, but not fuel usage. The \"Maintenance\" section talks about maintenance intervals and safety, not fuel. \n\nWait, maybe there's a part about the tractor's fuel consumption when using specific attachments. Let me look again. On page 20, there's a section about \"Transport\" and \"Contrôlez les câbles de l'attelage rapide\" (Check the hitch cables), but that's about safety during transport, not fuel. \n\nLooking at page 23, there's a mention of the GEOSPREAD system and its features, but again, no fuel data. The \"Modulation de dose automatique par GPS\" (Automatic dose modulation by GPS) on page 27 discusses GPS-based dosing but not fuel. \n\nI don't see any mention of diesel consumption or fuel efficiency related to the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD in the entire context.

The context mentions that for fine dosing, the machine is equipped with a system that allows precise adjustment, and it's used for spreading manure. It also talks about adjusting the orifice size for low flow rates to avoid clogging. However, I need to check if there's any mention of cost differences between fine and normal dosing.\n\nI'll scan through the sections again. There's a part that says, \"Pour obtenir un réglage fin et éviter tout risque d'obstruction, un passage vers un orifice plus grand est souhaitable.\" This talks about adjusting the orifice for fine dosing but doesn't mention cost.

From the context provided, there's mention of \"Épandage unilatéral en bordure\" which translates to one-sided boundary spreading. \n\nLooking through the context, specifically pages 28 and 29, there's a section about boundary spreading using the ExactLine system. The ExactLine allows spreading from the first spray row up to the edge, which is one-sided. The context mentions that it's possible to spread up to 100% of the fertilizer in the field and nothing on the border, but environmental standards allow only minimal loss on the field edge. \n\nHowever, the question is about small gardens. The context doesn't explicitly mention small gardens. It talks about fields and parcels, not specifically small gardens. The ExactLine system is described as suitable for spreading on the edges, but there's no direct information about its applicability to small gardens. \n\nThe user might be inferring that if it's suitable for field edges, it could work for small gardens. But the context doesn't state that. The answer needs to be based strictly on the provided information.

Let me scan through the pages again. \n\nOn Page 39, there's a mention of the IM Tellus Input cable. The text says: \"Si vous utilisez le boîtier de commande IsoMatch Tellus ou un autre boîtier de commande ISOBUS amovible sur un tracteur dépourvu du système de communication ISOBUS, il vous faut impérativement un boîtier électronique ECU.\" Then it explains that the ECU has a CAN 9-pole connector. \n\nFurther down, on the same page, it says: \" Raccordez le connecteur CAN au boîtier de commande.\" So, the cable is used to connect the CAN connector to the control box. \n\nWait, the question is about other connections. The main use mentioned is connecting to the tractor's CAN bus. But the user is asking for other kinds of connections. Let me check if there's any other mention. \n\nLooking at Page 41, there's a part about the IM Tellus Input cable being used for GPS signal. The text says: \"Si vous voulez utiliser la fonction GEOCONTROL, il vous faut un système de positionnement sur le tracteur. Si vous montez un récepteur GPS indépendant sur le tracteur, vous devez raccorder la prise derrière sur le boîtier de commande.\" So, the cable might also be used for GPS connections. \n\nWait, but the question is about other connections beyond the standard ones. The answer might be that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for GPS connections in addition to the CAN bus. However, the exact wording in the context might specify. \n\nWait, the original context mentions that the IM Tellus Input cable is used for connecting to the CAN bus on a non-ISO tractor, requiring an ECU. But the question is about other connections. Let me check again. \n\nIn the context, the IM Tellus Input cable is used for CAN connections. The answer might be that it's used for CAN connections. But the user is asking for other kinds. Wait, maybe the answer is that it's used for GPS connections as well. \n\nWait, looking back, the text on Page 41 says that for GEOCONTROL, a GPS system is needed, and the cable is connected to the control box. So the IM Tellus Input cable is used for GPS connections. Therefore, the answer is that it can be used for GPS connections. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"other kind of connections,\" implying that the primary use is one thing, and the answer is another. However, the context might not mention other connections. Let me check again. \n\nThe context mentions that the IM Tellus Input cable is used for CAN connections on non-ISO tractors. The answer might be that it's used for CAN connections. But the user is asking for other connections. Wait, maybe the answer is that it's used for GPS connections. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that it's used for CAN connections. But the question is about other connections. Wait, the user might be referring to the IM Tellus Input cable's other uses beyond the standard. \n\nWait, the context says that the IM Tellus Input cable is used for CAN connections. The answer is that it can be used for CAN connections. But the question is about other kinds. Maybe the answer is that it's used for GPS connections. \n\nWait, the text on Page 41 mentions that the cable is used for GPS signal. So the answer is that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for GPS connections. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check the exact text. \n\nOn Page 41: \"Si vous voulez utiliser la fonction GEOCONTROL, il vous faut un système de positionnement sur le tracteur. Si vous montez un récepteur GPS indépendant sur le tracteur, vous devez raccorder la prise derrière sur le bo, et enclenchez ensuite le signal externe qui convient en vous inspirant du manuel d'utilisation du logiciel.\" \n\nSo the cable is used for GPS connections. Therefore, the answer is that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for GPS connections. \n\nBut the question is about \"other kind of connections,\" so maybe the answer is that it's used for GPS connections in addition to CAN.

Let me look for keywords like \"stop,\" \"fermer,\" \"arrêter,\" or related terms.\n\nLooking through the pages, on Page 100, there's a section about stopping the spread. The instruction says: \"Fermez les unités de dosage en appuyant sur la touche 'STOP' pour effectuer le demi-tour sur tournière.\" That translates to closing the dosage units by pressing the 'STOP' button to perform the half-turn at the field edge.\n\nAnother mention is on Page 101: \"Arrêtez immédiatement d'épandre!\" which means to stop spreading immediately. Also, \"Débrayez immédiatement la prise de force!\" to disengage the power take-off. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the procedure to stop spreading. The most direct answer is from Page 100, where pressing STOP stops the dosage units. However, there's also mention on Page 101 about stopping immediately if there's a malfunction or clogging. \n\nWait, the user wants the exact steps. The answer should include both stopping the dosage and disengaging the power take-off. Let me check again. \n\nOn Page 100: \"Fermez les unités de dosage en appuyant sur la touche 'STOP' pour effectuer le demi-tour sur tournière.\" So pressing STOP stops the dosage. Then, on Page 101: \"Arrêtez immédiatement d'épandre! Débrayez immédiatement la prise de force!\" So stopping the spread involves both actions. \n\nBut the question is about the procedure to stop spreading. The answer should be the exact steps from the context. The key steps are pressing STOP to close the dosage units and disengaging the power take-off. However, the exact answer might be just pressing STOP as per Page 100. \n\nWait, the user might be looking for the immediate action to stop, which is pressing STOP. But the context also mentions stopping immediately in case of issues. However, the main procedure for stopping during the process is pressing STOP. Let me confirm. \n\nThe answer should be: Press the 'STOP' button to close the dosage units and perform the half-turn at the field edge. Also, disengage the power take-off if necessary. But the exact answer from the context is \"Fermez les unités de dosage en appuyant sur la touche 'STOP' pour effectuer le demi-tour sur tournière.\" So the answer is to press STOP to close the units and do the half-turn. \n\nBut the user might need the exact steps.

The user is asking why damage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing is most likely caused by a hard object. I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for mentions of damage to these parts. Looking at the sections about dysfunctions and obstructions, specifically on page 114, there's a list of probable causes. \n\nThe context says: \"Si les conditions sont humides, travaillez uniquement avec la bâche de trémie bien fermée. N'épandez jamais sans bâche de trémie lorsque les conditions sont humides. Ne laissez jamais l'engrais pendant longtemps dans l'épandeur.

The context states that a hard object or a large block of fertilizer can block the flow of fertilizer, leading to damage. Specifically, if a hard object blocks the agitator or the flow through the discharge bushing or nozzles, it can cause damage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing. The answer should directly reference this cause.\n</think>\n\nThe damage is most likely caused by a hard object blocking the agitator or the flow through the discharge bushing/orifices, leading to mechanical stress and wear on the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing.",

Then, on page 126, under \"Points de graissage,\" it mentions that all grease nipples can be lubricated with a universal grease. The instructions say to grease all grease nipples and check the condition of protective tubes and safety chains, replacing them if damaged.\n\nLooking further, on page 127, there's a section about greasing the profiled tubes of the drive shaft. It says that if resistance is noticed during coupling or uncoupling, grease the contact surfaces of the two profiled tubes. Also, the central housing has grease compartments filled with EP 00/000 gear grease, and you usually don't need to change it. The grease level in the housing under the spreader disks should be 35 mm below the fill hole.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the consequences of never lubricating the grease nipples.

The user's question is about the outcome if the grease nipples are never lubricated. The context might not have a direct answer. However, in the maintenance instructions, it's implied that regular lubrication is necessary to prevent wear and ensure proper function. But the exact consequence isn't stated. \n\nWait, looking at page 126, under \"Points de graissage,\" it says: \"Vous pouvez graisser tous les graisseurs de la machine avec un type de graisse universel.\" Then, in the maintenance intervals on page 125, there's a mention of greasing the grease nipples. However, there's no explicit statement about the consequences of not lubricating them. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide a direct answer to the question, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, maybe there's an indirect clue. For example, if the grease nipples are not lubricated, it could lead to increased wear, mechanical failure, or reduced lifespan. However, the context doesn't explicitly state this.

The question is about the minimum baud rate required for this connection.\n\nLooking through the context provided, I need to find any mention of RS232 and baud rates. Let me scan through the pages. \n\nOn Page 72, there's a section about \"Débit variable, à commande externe\" (Variable rate, external control). It mentions an RS232 connection.

The context is in French, so I'll need to parse through the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section on page 95 under \"Réglage de la machine\" and \"Hauteur d'épandage\". It mentions that the distance from the bottom of the vanes to the ground or crop should be 75 cm. The exact sentence is: \"La distance jusqu'au sol ou jusqu'à la végétation doit être de 75 cm.\" \n\nNow, the question is about the tolerance. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention any tolerance range around this 75 cm measurement. It only states the required distance. There's no mention of acceptable variation or a margin of error. \n\nI should check other sections to make sure I didn't miss any information. Scanning through other pages, the rest of the document discusses setup procedures, calibration, and operational steps, but nothing about tolerances for the distance measurement. \n\nSince the context only specifies the exact distance (75 cm) without any tolerance, the answer should reflect that.

However, in agricultural practices, typical wind speed limits for spreading are often around 10 m/s, but I need to confirm if that's mentioned here. \n\nLooking again, I don't see any specific numerical value mentioned in the context. The closest is the question on page 96 about wind speed not being too high, but no exact number.

There's a mention of using a tool to open the sieves, but it's not specified what type of tool. \n\nWait, on Page 134, under \"Réglage des disques de dosage,\" there's a step that says: \"Ouvrez les tamis avec l'outil fourni et verrouillez-les.\" The tool provided is probably a specific tool, but the context doesn't specify if it's a flathead or Phillips screwdriver. \n\nAnother place to check is Page 141, where they mention removing the agitator and using a tool to open the sieves. Again, no specific screwdriver type is mentioned. \n\nSince the context doesn't explicitly state the type of screwdriver required for adjusting the dosing mechanism, the answer would be that there's no information provided about the screwdriver type.

The context is a maintenance manual for some machinery, probably agricultural equipment given the terms like \"agitator\" and \"seal ring.\" \n\nLooking through the pages, I remember that on page 140, there's a section about replacing the agitator's seal ring. Let me check that. \n\nOn page 140, under \"Remplacement du joint d'étanchéité de l'arbre de l'agitateur\" (Replacement of the agitator shaft seal), it says: \"La bague d'étanchéité doit être remplacée à chaque début de saison et au bout de toutes les 100 heures d'utilisation de la machine.\" Translating that, it means the seal ring should be replaced at the start of each season and after every 100 hours of machine use.\n\nSo the answer is 100 hours. The user is asking for the typical lifespan before replacement, which according to the context is every 100 hours of operation. I need to make sure there's no other mention of the seal ring's lifespan elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, like page 130 and 131, they mention maintenance intervals but not specifically the seal ring's replacement frequency.

Specifically, on page 135, there's a part about adjusting the dosing discs. The text mentions that if the discs are correctly mounted, you can still see a little light when the dosing holes are closed. \n\nThe exact sentence is: \"Si les plaques de dosage sont correctement montées, vous pouvez encore apercevoir un peu de lumière lorsque les orifices de dosage sont fermés.\" Translating that, it means that when the dosing holes are closed, a small amount of light can still be seen. The dimension here is implied to be the gap that allows light through, which is the 'small crack of light' mentioned in the question.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a specific measurement provided. On page 135, after describing the light, the text says: \"La distance entre le côté intérieur de la ficelle et l'ouverture de la bague d'écoulement doit être de 109 mm.\" Wait, that's about the distance between the inner side of the rope and the opening of the flow ring, which might be related but not exactly the same as the gap between the dosing baffles.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check other parts. On page 137, there's a mention of the distance between the inner side of the rope and the opening of the flow ring being 109 mm. But the question is about the 'small crack of light' between the dosing baffles. \n\nLooking back at page 135, the text says that when the dosing discs are correctly mounted, you can still see a little light. The exact dimension isn't stated there, but the next part on page 135 mentions adjusting the position of the dosing discs so that the distance between the agitator shaft and the sealing ring is the same on all sides. However, that's about the agitator, not the dosing baffles.\n\nWait, maybe the 'small crack of light' refers to the gap between the dosing discs when closed. The text on page 135 says that if the discs are correctly mounted, you can still see a little light.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the information is not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",
