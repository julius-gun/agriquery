The user is asking, \"How many dosing openings are closed during fine application?\" I need to find the exact answer from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of \"fine application\" or \"dosage fin.\" The context mentions \"dosage fin\" several times. Let me look for the specific part that talks about the number of openings closed.\n\nIn the section about \"Dosage fin,\" it says: \"Pour l'épandage de fumier souterrain, l'épandeur est équipé de façon standard d'un système de dosage fin. Ce dosage fin doit être réglé, par unité de dosage, à l'aide d'un levier. Un faible débit requiert un petit orifice de dosage. Afin pour cela · obtenir un réglage fin · et éviter tout risque d'obstruction, un passage vers un orifice plus grand est souhaitable.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't mention the number of openings closed. Let me check again. Earlier, there's a part about the lever for closing 2 out of 3 openings. The context says: \"Le levier de dosage fin permettant de fermer ou d'ouvrir 2 orifices de dosage sur 3 est situé sur le côté extérieur du disque d'épandage...\" So, the lever for fine dosage allows closing 2 out of 3 openings. \n\nBut the question is about how many are closed during fine application. The context states that during fine dosage, you close 2 openings. The exact sentence is: \"vous pouvez en fermer 2 sur 3.\" So, during fine application, 2 out of 3 openings are closed. Therefore, the answer should be 2.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n2",

Translating that, it says the full field spreading pattern is covered at 100%. That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nLooking further, there's a mention of \"pour la moitié de la largeur de travail une nappe d'épandage en triangle avec un recouvrement complet.\" This translates to half the working width having a triangular spreading pattern with full coverage. But the question is specifically about the full field pattern, not the triangular one. \n\nThe other parts talk about adjustments and different spreading patterns, but nothing else about the overlap percentage for the full field.

The user is asking, \"What system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread?\" The context provided is in French, so I need to parse through that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for keywords related to measuring fertilizer quantity. The context mentions a \"distributeur d'engrais\" which translates to fertilizer distributor. There's also a \"système de commande\" which is the command system. The key part here is about continuous measurement. \n\nLooking at the first paragraph, it talks about a sensor that reduces the impact of various factors on the measured value. The distributor uses the reference sensor's signal to correct the measurements. Then, when the hopper's content drops below 100 kg, the automatic calibration stops, and the measurement precision decreases. \n\nFurther down, it mentions that the command system can spread a regular amount of fertilizer across the field, correcting changes in speed. It also says that if you fill the hopper during spreading, you must disable automatic calibration. The system measures the weight of fertilizer spread over a determined time and compares it to the desired flow rate. \n\nSo the system in question is the \"système de commande\" (command system) which continuously measures the fertilizer quantity. The answer should be precise and directly from the context. The exact term used is \"système de commande\" which translates to \"command system.\" The answer needs to be in English, so \"Command system\" is the direct translation. I need to make sure there's no other system mentioned that does this. The distributor is part of the system, but the command system is the one that measures continuously. The answer should be \"Command system\" as per the context.\n</think>\n\n[Command system]",

The context mentions that when the hopper content drops below 100 kg, the command system cuts off automatic calibration. That's a trigger condition, not the frequency. \n\nThen there's a part about the system using automatic calibration during spreading to find the right dosage settings. But it says the flow rate might deviate until the second automatic calibration, which takes about 2 minutes. However, this seems to be about the timing of the calibration process rather than how often it's done.\n\nAnother part mentions that the system can search for the correct dosage settings during spreading using automatic calibration. But again, this is about when it's used, not the frequency. \n\nThe question is about how often the spreader does these tests. The context doesn't explicitly state a time interval like every X hours or days. It only mentions that the calibration is triggered when the hopper is below 100 kg and that during spreading, the system uses automatic calibration. However, there's no information on how frequently this happens in terms of time intervals. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify a frequency (like every day, weekly, etc.), the answer would be that it's not found.

Then, there's a part about if the speed isn't measured on the machine but via the tractor, the speed sensor and cable from the tractor's electronics are connected to the IsoMatch. They mention a special cable set for this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: when the tractor lacks ISOBUS, the IsoMatch Power harness is used. Then, the speed signal is retrieved via the tractor's electronics using a special cable. The answer should specify that the speed is transmitted through the IsoMatch Power harness and the special cable that connects the tractor's speed sensor to the IsoMatch. \n\nWait, the exact answer needs to be precise. The context says \"le capteur de vitesse et le câble de l'adaptateur pour la récupération du signal du vitesse émis par l'électronique du tracteur sont raccordés au boîtier IsoMatch.\" So the speed sensor and the adapter cable are connected to IsoMatch. Also, they mention a special cable set. \n\nPutting it together, the answer should mention using the IsoMatch Power harness and the special cable for the speed signal.

The answer is that the speed is transmitted via the IsoMatch Power harness and the special cable that connects the tractor's speed sensor to the IsoMatch. \n\nI need to make sure it's concise and exact.

The key part here is the section that talks about checking the coupling shaft length and the steps involved.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a part that says: \"Le contrôle de la longueur et le raccourcissement de l'arbre de transmission s'effectuent après que vous ayez accroché le dispositif de levage, mais avant que vous accrochiez l'arbre de transmission : ... soulevez la machine à l'aide du dispositif de levage jusqu'à ce que la prise de force et l'arbre moteur de la machine se trouvent à la même hauteur.\"\n\nSo, the steps mentioned here are: after attaching the lifting device, before attaching the transmission shaft, you need to lift the machine with the lifting device until the power take-off and the machine's engine shaft are at the same height. \n\nThe question is about the specific precaution before working between the tractor and machine to check the coupling shaft length.

The user is asking whether the parking brake of the tractor should be engaged before connecting the machine. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse it carefully. \n\nLooking at the steps mentioned, there are several actions listed. The first part talks about disconnecting the electronic control system, turning off the tractor's contact, removing the key, and engaging the parking brake. It mentions that this prevents the tractor from starting while working on the machine, avoiding movement that could cause injuries. \n\nThen, there's a section about preparing to use the tractor and machine on public roads, which includes checking the tractor and machine's compliance with traffic rules, lighting, warnings, etc. Again, the same steps about disconnecting the system, turning off the tractor, removing the key, and engaging the parking brake are mentioned. \n\nFurther down, there's a part about stopping the power take-off (PTO) after disengaging it. Then steps like moving the tractor forward, turning off the engine, removing the key, engaging the parking brake, placing wedges, disconnecting electrical connectors, removing hydraulic hoses, etc. \n\nThe key points here are that engaging the parking brake is part of the safety procedures when working on the machine. The question is whether this should be done before connecting the machine. \n\nWait, the steps mention engaging the parking brake when disconnecting the system and before moving the tractor. But the question is about connecting the machine. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention connecting the machine. Instead, it talks about disconnecting the system and ensuring the tractor can't start. \n\nBut the user's question is about the parking brake being engaged before connecting the machine. The context doesn't mention connecting the machine. It talks about disconnecting the system and safety measures when working on the machine. So, the parking brake is engaged as part of the safety steps when working on the machine, not necessarily before connecting it. \n\nWait, maybe the steps are part of the process when disconnecting the machine. For example, when you're working on the machine, you need to ensure the tractor can't start, so you engage the parking brake. But the question is about connecting the machine. If the machine is being connected, perhaps the parking brake should be engaged to prevent movement. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that. \n\nThe answer needs to be based strictly on the context. Since the context mentions engaging the parking brake as part of the safety steps when working on the machine, but the question is about connecting the machine. The context doesn't mention connecting the machine, so the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, the steps listed include engaging the parking brake before working on the machine, which might imply that it's done before connecting. But the exact wording is about disconnecting the system and ensuring the tractor can't start. \n\nWait, the first part says: \"Vous éviterez ainsi que le tracteur puisse démarrer alors que vous travaillez sur la machine...\" which translates to \"You will prevent the tractor from starting while you work on the machine...\" So the parking brake is engaged as part of the safety measures when working on the machine. The question is whether it should be engaged before connecting the machine. If connecting the machine is part of the work, then yes. But the context doesn't explicitly say that the parking brake is engaged before connecting. It's part of the safety steps when working on the machine. \n\nSince the question is about connecting the machine, and the context doesn't mention that specific step, the answer might be \"Not found in context.\" However, the steps listed include engaging the parking brake as part of the safety procedures when working on the machine, which could be before connecting. But without explicit mention of connecting, it's unclear. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The context clearly states 30 degrees in both directions. There's also a mention of the maximum length being achieved at this angle, but the question is specifically about the angle, not the length. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of angles. The context repeats the 30 degrees up and down, so that's consistent. The instructions mention checking if the angle is less than 30 degrees, which reinforces that 30 is the maximum. \n\nSince the question asks for both when lifted and lowered, the answer should state 30 degrees upward and 30 degrees downward. The exact phrasing from the context is \"30 ° vers le haut et de 30 ° vers le bas,\" so translating that directly gives the answer. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other angle mentioned.

The term \"decoupling ropes\" might be translated as \"câbles de l'attelage rapide\" or \"raccords rapides\" in the context. The context mentions \"Contrôlez les câbles de l'attelage rapide\" which translates to \"Check the quick coupling cables.\" \n\nLooking at the instructions, there's a part that says the cables should never be stretched and must have sufficient movement even when the lifting device is in the lowest position. If they're not, the quick couplings might accidentally detach. So the key point here is ensuring the cables aren't stretched and have enough movement. \n\nThe question specifically asks about decoupling ropes during power lift connection. The answer should focus on the requirement for the cables to not be stretched and to have sufficient freedom of movement. The exact phrase from the context is \"Les câbles ne doivent jamais être tendus et doivent avoir une liberté de mouvement suffisante...\" which translates to \"The cables must never be stretched and must have sufficient freedom of movement.\"\n\nI need to make sure there's no other information about decoupling ropes in the context.

The answer should be 200 mm. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of distance. The rest of the context talks about other things like the height of the hopper, checking the spreader's position, etc., but not about the distance between the spreader and the platform beyond the 200 mm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 200 mm.

The user is asking about the materials required to perform the tray test based on the given context.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the context carefully. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse it accurately. The main sections mention when to perform a test on trays, which seems related to the tray test. \n\nLooking at the \"INDICATION\" section, it lists scenarios where a test is needed, like using specific types of fertilizer not in the manuals or with different granulometry and density. However, the question is about materials required, not when to perform the test. \n\nThen there's the \"Réalisation\" section, which outlines the steps to perform the test. The first step mentions cutting the tractor's engine, removing the key, and applying the parking brake. Then it talks about separating the left and right spreader disks by pushing the attachment piece left or right and securing it with a bolt. \n\nWait, the question is about materials, not the steps. The context doesn't explicitly list materials like tools or equipment. It describes actions to take, such as using the tractor's components, but not the materials needed. The mention of \"trémie pleine\" (full hopper) might be relevant, but that's more about the setup than materials. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify any materials required beyond the tractor and its parts, and the question is about materials, the answer might be that the context doesn't mention any specific materials. The user might be looking for tools or components, but the text doesn't list them. Therefore, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

I need to find the exact information from the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mentions of wind speed. In the first part, under point 8, it says \"vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\" which translates to high wind speeds exceeding 5 m/s. The instruction there is to proceed with spreading only when weather conditions are favorable, implying that winds above 5 m/s are not permissible.\n\nThen, looking at the part about the tray test, there's a note that says not to use the spreader when it's raining or humidity is high. But there's no specific mention of wind speed here. However, the initial mention of wind speed >5m/s being a bad condition for spreading would apply to both the tray test and actual spreading. \n\nWait, the question is about both the tray test and actual spreading. The context mentions that during actual spreading, high wind speeds (>5m/s) are a bad condition. But does it specify the same for the tray test? The tray test might be part of the setup or testing phase. However, the context doesn't explicitly state a wind speed limit for the tray test itself. The only direct mention is the 5m/s threshold for actual spreading. Since the question asks for both, but the context only specifies 5m/s for actual spreading, maybe the tray test also follows the same rule. But the answer should be based strictly on the context. If the context doesn't mention the tray test's wind speed, then maybe the answer is 5m/s as per the actual spreading, but the question says \"both\". Wait, the user might be referring to the same limit for both. Let me check again.\n\nThe context says \"Travail dans de mauvaises conditions météorologiques : humidité de l'air élevée, pluie, chaleur ou vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\" which translates to working in bad weather conditions: high air humidity, rain, heat, or high wind speeds (>5m/s). The instruction is to proceed only when conditions are favorable. So for actual spreading, the maximum permissible wind speed is 5m/s or less. The tray test might be part of the setup, but the context doesn't mention a different limit for the tray test. Therefore, the answer is 5m/s. But the question says \"both the tray test and actual spreading\". If the tray test is part of the actual spreading process, then the same limit applies. So the answer is 5m/s.\n</think>\n\n[5]",

The context also has a part that says \"Réglez la hauteur des disques à 75 cm au-dessus du sol ou de la plante.\" But the question specifically asks about the height above the troughs, which are referred to as \"bacs de collecte\" in the context. \n\nWait, the first mention is \"au-dessus des bacs de collecte\" (above the collection troughs), and later it says \"au-dessus du sol ou de la plante.\" But the question is about the height above the troughs, so the answer should be 75 cm above the troughs (bacs de collecte).

The other part mentions \"au-dessus du sol\" which is different. Therefore, the correct answer is 75 cm above the troughs (bacs de collecte).

The user is asking, \"After disengaging the PTO shaft, what poses a continued danger and why?\" So first, I need to understand what the PTO shaft is. PTO stands for Power Take-Off, which is a mechanism that transfers power from a tractor to an attached implement. Disengaging it would mean stopping that power transfer.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are several steps mentioned related to safety procedures when working on machinery. The key part here is after disengaging the PTO. The context says, \"La prise de force s'arrête après qu'elle ait été débrayée\" which translates to \"The power take-off stops after it has been disengaged.\" But then it mentions that even after disengagement, there's a danger because of the inertia of the machine. Specifically, it states, \"il existe un réel danger en raison de la rotation de la machine à cause de la force d'inertie.\" So the continued danger is the machine still rotating due to inertia.\n\nThe answer needs to be precise and concise. The question is asking for two things: what poses the danger and why. From the context, the danger is the machine's rotation due to inertia. The reason is the force of inertia. So the answer should state that the continued danger is the machine's rotation caused by inertia. I need to make sure I don't include any extra information not directly related. Also, check if there's any mention of other dangers, but the context seems to focus on inertia here. Let me confirm there's no other reason mentioned. The context also talks about not being near the machine until all parts stop, which supports the inertia reason. So the answer should be that the machine's rotation due to inertia poses the danger.\n</think>\n\nThe continued danger is the machine's rotation due to inertia, as the force of inertia keeps it moving after the PTO shaft is disengaged.",

I need to make sure there's no other mention of location. Another part mentions the 9-pin RS232 connector's pinout in the manual, but the location is specified as the back of the control box. \n\nSo the answer should be that the RS232 connector is located on the back side of the control box. I need to check if the context says \"face arrière\" which is \"back side\" in English. Yes, that's correct. The answer should be precise and match the exact wording from the context.\n</think>\n\n[The RS232 connector is located on the back side of the control box.]",

The context mentions several things related to fertilizer application and losses. There's a part about the maximum allowed loss in the ditch, which is defined by an environmental standard. \n\nThe key sentence here is: \"La perte maximale autorisée dans le fossé est définie dans une norme environnementale. Pour satisfaire à celle-ci, la quantité d'engrais dans le premier bac de collecte situé dans le fossé fictif peut représenter au maximum 10 % de la quantité contenue dans le bac de collecte au centre de la voie du tracteur (= 100 %).\"\n\nTranslating that, it says the maximum allowed loss in the ditch is set by an environmental standard. To meet this, the amount of fertilizer in the first collection tank in the ditch can be up to 10% of the amount in the center tank (which is 100%). \n\nSo the question is about the maximum loss in the middle trough. Wait, the middle trough is referred to as the \"bac de collecte au centre de la voie du tracteur\" which is 100%. The loss in the ditch (fossé) is 10% of that. But the question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" \n\nWait, maybe I need to parse this again. The maximum allowed loss in the ditch (fossé) is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the answer would be 10%? Because the ditch's loss is 10% of the middle trough's amount. But the question is asking for the maximum loss allowed in the ditch, which is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the answer is 10%? \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" So the loss in the ditch is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. Therefore, the maximum allowed is 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the answer is 10%.\n</think>\n\n10%",

The context mentions \"le dispositif de relevage\" (lifting device) and \"la position d'épandage en hauteur des tenons d'attelage\" (height spreading position of the hitch couplings). \n\nLooking for specific points on the machine. The key part might be \"la hauteur au-dessus du sol ou de la végétation à 75 cm\" which is measured from the machine's point. But where exactly? \n\nIn the context, there's a mention of \"le dispositif de relevage\" (lifting device) and \"la position d'épandage en hauteur des tenons d'attelage\" (hitch couplings' height spreading position). Also, there's a reference to \"le point de raccordement correspondant du boîtier de pignons\" (the corresponding connection point of the gear housing). \n\nWait, the question is about the machine point from which the height is measured. The context says \"la hauteur au-dessus du sol ou de la végétation à 75 cm\" and mentions \"le dispositif de relevage\" (lifting device) and \"la position d'épandage en hauteur des tenons d'attelage\" (hitch couplings' height spreading position). \n\nBut the exact point might be the \"tenons d'attelage\" (hitch couplings) since that's where the height is adjusted. Also, there's a mention of \"le point de raccordement correspondant du boîtier de pignons\" which is the connection point of the gear housing. However, the question is about the measurement point. \n\nWait, the context says \"la hauteur exigée de 75 cm au-dessus de la végétation n'est pas réalisable avec votre dispositif de levage\" which means if the required height isn't achievable with the lifting device, you use the hitch couplings' height position. So the measurement is from the hitch couplings. \n\nBut the exact answer might be \"the hitch couplings\" or \"the connection point of the gear housing.\" Wait, the context mentions \"monté l'arbre de transmission sur le point de raccordement correspondant du boîtier de pignons\" which is \"mounted the drive shaft on the corresponding connection point of the gear housing.\" But that's about installation, not measurement. \n\nAlternatively, the height is measured from the hitch couplings (tenons d'attelage) because that's where the height adjustment is made. The context says \"utilisez la position d'épandage en hauteur des tenons d'attelage\" which implies that the height is measured from there. \n\nSo the answer is the hitch couplings (tenons d'attelage). But the question is in English, so the answer should be in English.

The user is asking for the sound level in dB of a Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with the rear window opened.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has several rows with different measurements. Let me scan through each line.\n\nLooking at row 1, it mentions \"Niveau sonore\" (sound level) with two columns: \"Cabine fermée\" (closed cabin) and \"Vitre arrière ouverte\" (rear window open). The values under \"Vitre arrière ouverte\" are 76.2 and 82.3. Wait, but the rows might be related to different scenarios. \n\nWait, row 2 has \"Tracteur tournant à 540 tr/min (dB)\" with values 71.9 and 76.2. Then row 3 is \"Tracteur + épandeur fonctionnant à vide (dB)\" with 71.9 and 82.3. Row 4 is \"Tracteur + épandeur en cours de travail (Kali 60) (dB)\" with 73.8 and 84.6. Row 5 adds \"ExactLine\" with 73.0 and 87.2. \n\nSo, the question is about the Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with the rear window open. The relevant row here is row 4, which is \"Tracteur + épandeur en cours de travail (Kali 60) (dB)\" and under \"Vitre arrière ouverte\" it's 84.6 dB. \n\nWait, but row 1's \"Vitre arrière ouverte\" has 82.3. But that might be for the tractor alone? Let me check. Row 2 is the tractor running at 540 RPM, and row 3 is tractor + spreader idle. So row 4 is the working condition (Kali 60) and under \"Vitre arrière ouverte\" it's 84.6. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 84.6 dB. Let me confirm there's no other entry. Row 5 includes ExactLine, which is an additional component, so that's not relevant here. The question doesn't mention ExactLine, so row 4 is the correct one. The rear window open corresponds to the second column, which for row 4 is 84.6. So the answer is 84.6 dB.\n</think>\n\n84.6",

The context provided is in French, so I need to parse through that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of \"vanes\" or \"pales\" since \"pales\" translates to \"vanes\" in English. Scanning through the context, I see a line that says \"4 État pales · · · 43\". The \"4\" here likely refers to the interval. \n\nLooking at the intervals listed earlier, there's a section that starts with \"Tous les jours\", \"Au bout des 10 premières heures\", \"Toutes les semaines\", \"Toutes les 100 heures\", etc. The number 4 is under the \"État pales\" entry. Since the numbers correspond to the intervals, the fourth interval is \"Toutes les 100 heures\". \n\nWait, but the numbers might not be in order. Let me check again. The first entry is \"0 Contrôler\" which might be a header. Then \"1 Contrôle des boulons...\" which is the first interval. Then \"2 Contrôle du système hydraulique\" as the second. Then \"3 État agitateur...\" third. Then \"4 État pales\" fourth. So the fourth interval is \"Toutes les 100 heures\". \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Toutes les 100 heures\". But I need to confirm that the number 4 corresponds to that interval. The context lists intervals with numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The \"4\" under \"État pales\" would be the fourth interval, which is \"Toutes les 100 heures\". \n\nYes, that seems correct.

The user is asking for the torque in Nm required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a friction coefficient of 0.13.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information. The context has several lines with different bolt sizes, qualities, and friction coefficients. Let me scan through the data.\n\nLooking at the lines, there's a section that lists \"Couples de serrage\" which translates to torque values. The entries are structured as Quality.Friction * Filetage Couples de serrage. For example, \"4.6.0,10\" and similar entries. \n\nThe user is asking about a M18 bolt. Wait, in the context, the first line starts with 9 and 10, but the numbers might correspond to bolt sizes.

Maybe the first number is the bolt size? Wait, perhaps the numbers are torque values for different bolt sizes. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the context has lines like:\n\n9                          M22                          170                          200                          470                          560                           670                           800                           780                           930\n\nThen the next line starts with 10, then M24, followed by numbers.

Wait, maybe the first number is the bolt size in millimeters? Wait, M22 is a metric bolt size, so the numbers 9 and 10 might be the bolt size? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the first number is the bolt size in millimeters? Wait, M22 is a bolt with a diameter of 22mm. So maybe the first number is the bolt size? Wait, the first line starts with 9, then M22. Maybe the 9 is the bolt size? But that would be 9mm, but the next line starts with 10, then M24. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Maybe the numbers are torque values?

The entries are structured as \"Couples de serrage.QUALITY.FRICTION\", so for example, \"10.9.0,10\" would be a 10.9 quality bolt with a friction coefficient of 0.10. The numbers after that might be the torque values. Wait, but the numbers are in the same line as the quality and friction. Wait, maybe the numbers are the torque values for each combination. Let me check the context again.\n\nLooking at the first line: 9, M22, then numbers like 170, 200, etc. Maybe the first number is the bolt size (like 9mm), then M22 is the bolt size? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are torque values for different friction coefficients. Wait, the context mentions \"Le coefficient de friction de 0,10 convient pour plaque huilée...\" which is friction coefficient 0.10. Then later, \"Couples de serrage.10.9.0,10\" which would be for a 10.9 quality bolt with 0.10 friction. The numbers after that might be the torque values. Wait, but the numbers are in the same line as the M22. Maybe the numbers are the torque values for different friction coefficients. For example, the first line starts with 9, then M22, then numbers like 170, 200, etc. Maybe the numbers are the torque values for different friction coefficients.

First, I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that the IM Tellus Input cable is used for connecting the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch Tellus control box. It also says that if there's no ISO 11786 port in the cab, this cable can be used. Then there's a part about a cable ISO available for trailed spreaders, replacing the short cable already installed. However, the question is about other connections beyond the speed sensor and radar.\n\nWait, the context also mentions that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for connecting the tractor's speed sensor or radar. But the question is asking for other kinds of connections. Let me check again. The text says, \"Avec l'entrée capteur IsoMatch Tellus disponible en option, vous pouvez raccorder le capteur de vitesse du tracteur ou le radar au boîtier de commande IsoMatch Tellus.\" So that's the speed sensor and radar. Then there's a part about a cable ISO for trailed spreaders. But the question is about other connections. Wait, the user is asking for other connections besides the ones mentioned. Wait, the question is \"For what other kind of connections can the IM Tellus Input cable be used?\" So the answer should be other than the speed sensor and radar.

Changez le câble entier.\" So that's for trailed spreaders. But the question is about the IM Tellus Input cable. Wait, the IM Tellus Input cable is the same as the ISO cable? Or is there a distinction? The context mentions \"l'entrée capteur IsoMatch Tellus\" which is the input cable. Then there's a separate mention of a cable ISO for spreaders. So maybe the IM Tellus Input cable is used for speed sensor and radar, and the ISO cable is for spreaders. But the question is about the IM Tellus Input cable. So the answer would be that it can also be used for the spreaders? Wait, the context says \"Vous pouvez l'utiliser si vous n'avez pas de prise ISO 11786 en cabine. Les autres branchements sont identiques à ceux du faisceau de raccordement pour IsoMatch Tellus fourni en standard.\" So \"l\" refers to the IM Tellus Input cable. So if there's no ISO 11783 port, you can use this cable. Then the other connections are the same as the standard wiring harness. Wait, but the question is about other connections. The answer might be that the IM Tellus Input cable can also be used for the spreaders. Wait, the context says \"Un câble ISO est disponible pour les épandeurs traînés.\" But that's a separate cable.

The user is asking, \"How should one proceed to stop spreading the fertilizer?\" based on the given context.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the context carefully. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse it accurately. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nThe context starts by talking about damaged parts like blades, spreader disk, or flow rings, likely caused by a hard foreign object. It mentions that the agitator might be damaged and that you must first repair the damage before continuing. Then there are steps like introducing an object into the flow ring's opening to prevent fertilizer loss during transport. \n\nNext, there are points about starting the tractor, connecting the control box, and the spreader units opening. Then there's a section about visible spreading bands in vegetation, mentioning using an inappropriate spreader table and selecting the right one based on fertilizer properties. \n\nAnother part talks about working in bad weather conditions and advising to spread only when conditions are favorable. Then there are steps to inspect the hopper for blocks, mount the blades, check the drop point setting, close the hopper cover, and continue spreading. \n\nFinally, if the block or stuck fertilizer can't be reduced due to inaccessibility or lack of tools, you close the hopper, follow the previous procedure for damage, and drain the hopper until it's empty.\n\nNow, the question is about stopping the spreading of fertilizer. The key here is to find the exact steps mentioned in the context that relate to stopping the process. \n\nLooking through the steps, the context mentions several actions. For example, after inspecting the hopper and mounting the blades, it says to \"Continue l'épandage\" which translates to continue spreading. But the user is asking how to stop spreading. \n\nWait, there's a part where if you can't reduce the block or stuck fertilizer, you close the hopper cover and follow the damage procedure until the hopper is empty. That might be related to stopping. Also, the initial step says to repair the damage before continuing, implying that if there's a damage, you stop to fix it. \n\nBut the question is about stopping the spreading process. The context doesn't explicitly mention stopping the spreading. However, there's a step that says \"Refermez la bâche de trémie\" (Close the hopper cover) and \"Continuez l'épandage\" (Continue spreading). Wait, maybe when you close the hopper cover, you stop the spreading? Or perhaps when you follow the procedure to drain the hopper, you stop. \n\nAlternatively, the instruction says \"Si vous n'avez pas réussi à réduire le bloc... : Refermez la bâche de trémie. Suivez la procédure décrite... jusqu'à la vidange de la trémé et une fois celle-ci vide.\" So, if you can't reduce the block, you close the hopper cover and follow the procedure to drain the hopper until it's empty. That might be the process to stop spreading. \n\nBut the question is about how to stop spreading. The answer might be to close the hopper cover and follow the procedure to drain it. However, the exact answer needs to be precise. Let me check again. \n\nThe context mentions \"Refermez la bâche de trémie\" (Close the hopper cover) and \"Continuez l'épandage\" (Continue spreading). But if you can't reduce the block, you close the cover and follow the procedure. So, the steps to stop would be closing the cover and following the procedure. However, the exact answer should be the direct instruction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is to close the hopper cover and follow the procedure to drain it. But the question is about stopping the spreading. The context doesn't explicitly say \"stop spreading,\" but the steps after closing the hopper and draining might be part of stopping. \n\nWait, the user is asking how to stop spreading. The context doesn't have a direct instruction on stopping, but the steps after closing the hopper and draining might be part of the process to stop. However, the answer should be based on the context. Since the context doesn't mention stopping explicitly, but the steps to stop would be closing the hopper and following the procedure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is to close the hopper cover and follow the procedure. But I need to check if that's the exact instruction. The context says: \"Si vous n'avez pas réussi à réduire le bloc... : Refermez la bâche de trémie. Suivez la procédure décrite au paragraphe précédent »En cas de dommage« jusqu'à la vidange de la trémie et une fois celle-ci vide.\" So, the steps are to close the cover and follow the damage procedure until the hopper is empty.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking why most types of fertiliser attract water. The context provided is in French, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the context carefully. The key points mentioned are about fertiliser forming blocks when it absorbs water, leading to issues like clogging in the spreader or damaging the spreader's nappe. There's also mention of using the closed bunker cover in humid conditions and not spreading without it. The instructions emphasize cleaning the spreader thoroughly after each use to prevent blockages, especially if the spreader wasn't cleaned properly after the last use.\n\nNow, the question is about why most fertilisers attract water. Looking through the context, the relevant part is: \"La plupart des types d'engrais absorbent l'eau et peuvent alors former des blocs.\" Translating that, it says most types of fertiliser absorb water and can then form blocks. The reason given here is that they absorb water, which leads to blockages. However, the question is asking why they attract water, not the consequence of that. Wait, the context states that they absorb water, which is the reason they form blocks. But the question is phrased as \"why do most types of fertiliser attract water?\" So the answer would be because they absorb water. But the context doesn't explain the reason why they absorb water; it just states that they do. So the answer is that they absorb water, which is the direct information from the context. The user might be looking for the reason, but the context doesn't provide a deeper reason beyond the fact that they absorb water. Therefore, the answer should be based on the exact information given, which is that they absorb water. So the answer is that most fertilisers attract water because they absorb it, leading to blockages. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"why do they attract water?\" The context says they absorb water, which is the reason they form blocks. But the answer should be the direct cause mentioned. The context doesn't explain why they absorb water, just that they do. So the answer is that they absorb water, which is the direct information. Therefore, the answer is that most types of fertiliser attract water because they absorb it, which is stated in the context. But the exact wording in the context is \"absorbent l'eau\" which translates to \"absorb water.\" So the answer should be that they absorb water, which is the reason they form blocks. But the question is why they attract water. The context doesn't explain the reason for the attraction, just that they do. So the answer is that they absorb water, which is the direct information. Therefore, the answer is that most types of fertiliser attract water because they absorb it.

The user is asking why damage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing is most likely caused by a hard object. The context provided is in French, so I need to parse that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context for mentions of damage and the causes. The context mentions that if the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing are damaged, the defect is \"probablement causé par un corps étranger dur.\" That translates to \"most likely caused by a hard foreign object.\" \n\nThe question is asking for the reason why these specific parts are damaged by a hard object. The context directly states that the damage is caused by a hard foreign object. There's also mention of other possible causes like blockages from hard objects or fertilizer blocks, but the direct answer to the question is the part that explicitly links the damage to a hard object. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not adding any extra information. The answer should be precise and only include what's directly stated. The key sentence is \"le défaut a très probablement été causé par un corps étranger dur.\" So the answer should reflect that the damage is most likely due to a hard foreign object. \n\nI should check if there's any other part of the context that might provide more details, but the question is specifically about the cause of the damage. The answer is straightforward from the given text. No need to infer beyond what's written.

First, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information.\n\nThe context starts with \"Procédure à suivre en cas de blessures\" which translates to \"Procedure in case of injuries.\" It mentions that if someone is injured and possibly in contact with chemicals, they should wash the area thoroughly with water and consult a doctor immediately. But the question is about someone who fell into fertilizer and no doctor is available. \n\nWait, the context says to consult a doctor without delay. But if there's no physician available, does that mean the answer is to still consult a doctor even if they can't find one? Or is there another step mentioned? Let me check again. The context doesn't mention anything about what to do if a physician isn't available. It only says to consult one immediately. The rest of the context talks about damaged parts of equipment and procedures for spreading fertilizer, which doesn't seem related to the question. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide any alternative actions when a physician isn't available, the answer should be based on the given instructions. The user might be expecting that even if no doctor is available, the person should still seek medical help, but the context doesn't specify that. The answer should strictly follow the context. Therefore, the correct answer is to consult a doctor immediately, even if they can't find one. But the context doesn't mention anything about the availability of a physician, so maybe the answer is \"Consult a doctor immediately!\" as per the context. However, the user's question is about when no physician is available. The context doesn't address that scenario, so the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Wait, the instructions say if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Since the context only tells to consult a doctor immediately but doesn't mention what to do if one isn't available, the answer would be \"Not found in context.\" But the initial instruction says to base the answer strictly on the context.

The user is asking, \"What happens if the machine grease nipples are never lubricated?\" I need to find the answer in the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of consequences related to not lubricating the grease nipples. The context talks about greasing the grease nipples, cleaning the machine, and avoiding high-pressure washers on certain parts. There's a part that says, \"N'utilisez jamais de nettoyeur haute pression sur les joints d'étanchéité...\" which is about not using high-pressure cleaners on seals, but that's not directly about not lubricating.\n\nLooking further, there's a section under \"Points de graissage\" (Lubrication Points) mentioning the grease nipples. The instruction says to grease the grease nipples and check the protective tubes and safety chains. However, there's no explicit statement about what happens if they're never lubricated. \n\nWait, there's a part that says, \"INDICATION Utilisez de la graisse qui ne sèche pas et ne durcit pas pour éviter d'endommager les récupérateurs d'huile des vérins.\" This is about using non-drying grease to prevent damaging oil recovery units. But that's more about the type of grease rather than the consequence of not lubricating.\n\nAnother part mentions \"arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents au cours du travail avec la machine.\" This translates to fewer stops due to incidents during machine operation. But that's about frequent stops, not directly related to not lubricating the nipples.\n\nHmm, maybe the answer isn't explicitly stated. The context doesn't mention any specific consequences of not lubricating the grease nipples. It only provides instructions on how to lubricate them and the importance of using the right type of grease. Since there's no direct information about the outcome of neglecting lubrication, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The user is asking, \"What is the 'hose coupling support' made of?\" First, I need to look through the provided context to find any information related to the material or composition of the hose coupling support.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a lot of technical instructions about replacing hoses, using original parts, proper installation, and safety measures. The mention of \"serre-tubes en acier inoxydable\" stands out. \"Serre-tubes\" translates to tube clamps or hose clamps, and \"acier inoxydable\" is stainless steel. The context also talks about using these clamps during installation. \n\nHowever, the question is specifically about the hose coupling support, not the clamps. The term \"support\" might refer to a part that holds the hose coupling. But in the context, the only mention related to materials is the stainless steel clamps. There's no explicit mention of the support's material. \n\nWait, maybe the \"support\" here is the same as the \"serre-tubes\"? Or perhaps the support is made of the same material as the clamps? The context says to use stainless steel clamps when mounting, but that's for securing the hose, not necessarily the support structure itself. \n\nSince the question is about the material of the hose coupling support, and the context doesn't explicitly state what the support is made of, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, there's a mention of \"attelage rapide\" (quick coupling) and \"pieces de rechange d'origine\" (original replacement parts), but that's about the hose itself, not the support. \n\nI need to make sure there's no mention of the support's material. Scanning again, the context talks about the container d'étalonnage (calibration container), manilles (slings), and other components, but nothing about the support's material.

The user is asking for the maximum acceptable 'chunk' size of fertilizer in millimeters to prevent blockage. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has some information about granulometry, which relates to the particle size distribution of fertilizer. There are several points mentioned about different size ranges and their implications.\n\nThe key part here is the instruction about when the fertilizer is difficult to spread. The first point says that if 10% or more of the fertilizer grains have a diameter less than 2.0 mm, it's hard to spread, especially on large areas. This leads to poor distribution and plant damage. \n\nThen there's another point stating that when 80-100% of the grains are between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, it's easy to spread regardless of other grain sizes. The third point mentions that if 20% or more of the grains are larger than 4.75 mm, it's difficult to spread with optimal distribution, potentially causing damage if the granules fall on the plants.\n\nThe question is about the maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. Blockage might be related to the first point where small particles (under 2.0 mm) cause issues. However, the user is asking for the maximum size that's acceptable. The second point says that up to 4.75 mm is okay. Wait, but the third point says that if 20% or more are over 4.75 mm, it's problematic. So the maximum acceptable size to prevent blockage would be 4.75 mm. Because if you have particles larger than that, it's hard to spread. Therefore, the maximum acceptable size to avoid blockage is 4.75 mm. \n\nWait, but the question is about preventing blockage. The first part mentions that small particles (under 2.0 mm) can cause blockage? Or is it the other way around? Let me check again. The first instruction says that if 10% or more of the grains are under 2.0 mm, it's difficult to spread, leading to poor distribution and plant damage. So maybe the small particles are the issue. But the question is about the maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. If the particles are too small, they might cause blockage? Or maybe the problem is with the large particles. \n\nWait, the third point says that if 20% or more are over 4.75 mm, it's difficult to spread. So large particles (over 4.75 mm) are problematic. So the maximum acceptable size to prevent blockage would be 4.75 mm. Because if you have particles larger than that, it's hard to spread. Therefore, the answer should be 4.75 mm. \n\nBut the user is asking for the maximum acceptable size. So the maximum size that's acceptable is 4.75 mm.

The user is asking about the typical wind speed limit in meters per second before spreading quality becomes unacceptable. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context has several entries, some of which mention wind speed. Let me scan through each part.\n\nLooking at entry 8, it says: \"Travail dans de mauvaises conditions météorologiques : humidité de l'air élevée, pluie, chaleur ou vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\". This translates to working in bad weather conditions, including high wind speeds over 5m/s. The instruction is to proceed only when conditions are favorable. So, if wind speed exceeds 5m/s, it's considered unfavorable.\n\nAnother part mentions: \"Ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitesses supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" This translates to not proceeding with spreading when wind speed is above 3 m/s. The force of wind 2 is mentioned here, which might correspond to a specific wind scale, but the key point is the 3 m/s threshold.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. One part says 5m/s is the limit, another says 3m/s. Which one is correct? The question is about when the spreading quality becomes unacceptable. The first entry (entry 8) mentions that if wind speed is over 5m/s, you should not proceed. The second part (the bullet point) says not to proceed if wind is over 3m/s. \n\nBut the user is asking for the typical limit. Let me check the context again. The bullet point says \"ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitesses supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" So that's 3 m/s. However, entry 8 mentions \"vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\" as part of bad weather conditions. \n\nWait, maybe the 3m/s is a lower threshold for not proceeding, while 5m/s is a higher threshold for bad conditions. But the question is about when the quality becomes unacceptable. The bullet point specifically says that if wind is above 3m/s, you shouldn't spread. The entry 8 says that if wind is over 5m/s, you should not proceed. \n\nBut the user is asking for the typical limit. Which one is the correct answer? The context has conflicting numbers. However, the bullet point is more specific. Let me check the exact wording. The bullet point says \"ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitesses supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" So the limit is 3 m/s. The entry 8 mentions \"vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\" as part of bad conditions. \n\nBut the question is about when the quality becomes unacceptable. The bullet point directly states that above 3m/s, you shouldn't spread, implying that at 3m/s, the quality is already unacceptable. However, entry 8 says that above 5m/s is bad. But maybe the 3m/s is the lower limit for not proceeding, and 5m/s is a higher threshold. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the typical limit. The answer might be 3 m/s as per the bullet point. However, the entry 8 mentions 5m/s. But the bullet point is more specific. Let me check again. The bullet point says \"ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitesses supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" So the limit is 3 m/s. The entry 8 says \"vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\" as part of bad conditions. \n\nBut the question is about when the quality becomes unacceptable. The bullet point is more directly related to the quality. The entry 8's 5m/s is part of bad conditions, but the bullet point's 3m/s is a direct instruction. Therefore, the answer is 3 m/s. However, the user might be looking for the higher limit. Wait, the context has two different numbers. Which one is correct? \n\nWait, the bullet point says \"ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitesses supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" So the limit is 3 m/s. The entry 8 says \"vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\" as part of bad conditions. So the answer depends on which part is the correct one. \n\nBut the user is asking for the typical limit.

But the question is about driving speed reduction, not PTO speed.

The context mentions reducing the flow rate by 25%, but the question is about speed. However, maybe there's a connection between speed and flow rate. If the speed is reduced, the application rate might need adjustment. But the context here says to either keep the same speed (so no reduction) or reduce the flow rate by 25%. \n\nBut the user is asking specifically about speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't explicitly state a percentage for speed reduction. It mentions reducing the PTO speed to 75% in the first scenario, but that's about the PTO, not the actual driving speed. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 25%? Because in the second part, they mention reducing the flow rate by 25% if you choose to adjust the speed. But the question is about speed reduction. However, the context might be implying that if you reduce the speed, you need to adjust the flow rate. But the exact answer might be 25% as per the flow rate adjustment. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 25% because the instruction says to reduce the flow rate by 2, but the question is about speed. Wait, the user is asking about speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't directly state a percentage for speed reduction. The only mention of percentage is 75% for PTO speed. \n\nWait, the first part says \"Réduisez la vitesse de l'arbre de prise de force à 75%.\" That's PTO speed, not driving speed. The second part says \"réduisez le débit de 25 %.\" That's flow rate, not speed. \n\nSo the question is about driving speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't mention a specific percentage for driving speed reduction. Therefore, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, maybe there's a connection between the PTO speed and driving speed. If the PTO speed is reduced to 75%, perhaps that affects the driving speed.

The context doesn't directly state a percentage for speed reduction. The only percentage mentioned is 75% for PTO speed and 25% for flow rate. Since the question is about speed, and the context doesn't mention a speed reduction percentage, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking about the distance tolerance in meters from the field edge when driving the 'first path' for border spreading. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of distance tolerance. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse that carefully. \n\nLooking at the first set of instructions, there's a mention of \"Effectuez un premier passage avec le centre du tracteur sur environ 2 mètres à partir de la bordure de parcelle.\" Translating that, it says to perform the first pass with the tractor's center about 2 meters from the field edge. \n\nThen there's a part about maintaining the exact distance until the field edge using stakes as an example. The key part here is \"Maintenez la distance exacte jusqu'à la bordure de parcelle, par exemple à l'aide de piquets.\" This indicates that the distance should be exact, but the question is about the tolerance, which might refer to how precise this distance needs to be. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention a tolerance value. It specifies 2 meters for the first pass but doesn't state a margin of error or tolerance. \n\nThe user might be confusing the required distance with the tolerance. Since the context doesn't mention any tolerance beyond the exact distance, the answer should be that the exact distance is 2 meters, but there's no specified tolerance. However, the question specifically asks for the distance tolerance. If the context doesn't mention a tolerance, the correct answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nWait, the first instruction says \"environ 2 mètres\" which means approximately 2 meters. The exact distance is maintained using stakes, but the initial setup is about 2 meters. The question is about the tolerance, which isn't directly stated. Therefore, the answer should be that the distance is approximately 2 meters, but the tolerance isn't specified. However, the user might be looking for the exact value mentioned, which is 2 meters. But the question is about tolerance, not the exact distance. Since the context doesn't mention a tolerance, the answer should be \"Unknown.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The user is asking how many operational hours the 'vanes' can typically last before needing replacement. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of the lifespan or replacement intervals for the vanes. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse that carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about the wear of the spreading vanes (pales d'épandage). It mentions that the large vanes are grouped in threes. The first vane visible in the rotation direction wears out the fastest. The instructions say to replace the first vane near the short vane with the third one after a certain time, then later replace that first vane with the middle one. This rotation is meant to make the wear homogeneous and maintain optimal spreading.\n\nHowever, the key part here is the specific mention of operational hours. The context states \"Au bout de s 10 pr emière s heur es\" which translates to \"After the first 10 hours.\" Wait, that seems like a typo. Maybe it's \"Au bout de 10 premières heures\" meaning \"After the first 10 hours.\" But the user is asking about how long they last before replacement, not just the initial period. \n\nWait, looking again, there's a mention of \"Au bout de s 10 pr emière s heur es\" which might be a typo for \"Au bout de 10 premières heures\" (After the first 10 hours). But that seems like the initial period, not the total lifespan. However, the context also mentions \"Tout es  les 10 0 h e u res\" which is \"Every 100 hours.\" So maybe the vanes need replacement every 100 hours? Wait, the context says \"Tout es  les 10 0 h e u res\" which is \"Every 100 hours.\" But the question is about how long they typically last before replacement. \n\nWait, the context mentions that the vanes should be replaced in a rotating manner, but the exact operational hours aren't directly stated. The only numerical value mentioned is \"Au bout de s 10 pr emière s heur es\" which might be \"After the first 10 hours\" but that's probably a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"Au bout de 10 premières heures\" (After the first 10 hours) refers to the initial check, but the actual replacement interval isn't specified. \n\nWait, the user's question is about how many hours the vanes can last before needing replacement. The context doesn't explicitly state a number of hours for replacement. It talks about replacing them in a certain order to distribute wear, but the exact operational hours aren't given. The only numerical value is \"10 premières heures\" (first 10 hours) which might be a typo for \"10 heures\" (10 hours). However, that's likely referring to an initial check, not the replacement interval. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide a specific number of operational hours for replacement, the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But wait, the user's question might be referring to the replacement interval mentioned in the context. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at the context, there's a line: \"Tout es  les 10 0 h e u res\" which is \"Every 100 hours.\" This might be the maintenance interval for some parts, but the question is about the vanes. The vanes are mentioned in the context, but the exact replacement interval isn't given. The instructions mention replacing them in a certain order, but not the number of hours. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" because the context doesn't specify the operational hours before replacement for the vanes. The only numerical value mentioned is \"10 premières heures\" which is likely a typo for \"10 heures\" (10 hours), but that's for an initial check, not the replacement interval.

The context does mention using grease that doesn't dry or harden to avoid damaging oil recovery systems, but that's more about the properties rather than the type.\n\nThe question is specifically about the type of universal grease. Since the context doesn't specify a particular brand or type beyond \"universal grease,\" the answer would have to be that the context doesn't provide the exact type. However, the user might be expecting the answer to be \"universal grease\" as per the text.

Since the context only mentions using a universal grease without specifying a particular type, the answer would be that the context doesn't specify the exact type beyond it being universal. However, the user might be looking for the exact term from the context. Let me check again.\n\nThe exact sentence is: \"Vous pouvez graisser tous les graisseurs de la machine avec un type de graisse universel.\" So the answer is that the universal grease is recommended, but the context doesn't specify a particular type beyond that. Therefore, the answer should be that the context doesn't provide the exact type, so the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Wait, but the user's instruction says if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, the context does mention \"type de graisse universel,\" which is the type. So the answer is \"universal grease.\" But the question is asking for the type of 'universal grease' recommended. Wait, maybe the answer is that the context doesn't specify the type beyond it being universal. Therefore, the answer would be \"Not found in context.\" But the user's instruction says to extract the exact information. The context says \"un type de graisse universel,\" which translates to \"a type of universal grease.\" So the answer is that the type is \"universal grease,\" but the context doesn't specify a particular brand or type beyond that. Therefore, the answer is \"universal grease\" as per the context. Wait, the question is phrased as \"What type of 'universal grease' is recommended...\" So the answer is that the context mentions using a universal grease, but doesn't specify a particular type. Therefore, the answer should be \"universal grease\" as the type, but since the context doesn't give more details, maybe the answer is \"universal grease\" as the type.

But the context doesn't mention the material of the feeler gauge itself. It just says to use plates of 1.0 mm. So the answer would be that the material isn't specified. But the user might be expecting that the plates are made of a certain material, like steel or another metal. However, the context doesn't state that. \n\nSince the context doesn't mention the material of the feeler gauge, the correct answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". But the user's instruction says to respond with \"Unknown\" if unsure. However, the context does mention using plates of 1.0 mm thickness, but not their material. Therefore, the answer should be that the material isn't specified. But the question is about the type of material. Since the context doesn't provide that information, the answer is \"Unknown\".\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

Scanning through the context, I see phrases like \"joint d'étanchéité en plastique\" which translates to \"plastic seal.\" The question is about the material specification, so I need to check if the context specifies what material the plastic seal is made of. \n\nLooking at the steps, there's a mention of replacing the \"joint d'étanchéité en plastique\" (plastic seal). However, the context doesn't explicitly state the material beyond \"plastique.\" The user is asking for the material specification, but the context only refers to it as plastic. There's no mention of specific types like PTFE, rubber, or other materials. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide more details than \"plastic,\" the answer should reflect that. The user might be expecting a more specific material, but based on the given text, it's only specified as plastic. Therefore, the answer should state that the material is plastic, as that's the only information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe context specifies the \"plastic seal\" as \"joint d'étanchéité en plastique,\" but does not provide further material details beyond \"plastique.\"  \n**Answer:** Plastic (no additional material specification provided).",

The initial mention is \"en métal,\" which directly states the material is metal. But I should check if there's any other mention of material. \n\nFurther down, there's a part about replacing the plastic seal: \"Remplacez le joint d'étanchéité en plastique.\" That's the plastic one, but the metal ones are already mentioned as \"métalliques\" in the instructions. \n\nSo the answer should be that the metal seal rings are made of metal.

There's a mention of \"Câble de rallonge ISO\" which translates to \"ISO extension cable.\" Then there's a line that says \"Juste après le câble de raccordement ISO 11786 dans la cabine\" which means \"Just after the ISO 11786 connection cable in the cab.\" \n\nLooking at the numbered list, entry 1 is \"Câble de rallonge ISO\" and the number 144 is associated with it.

The line \"0       1\" followed by \"0   Câble avec connecteurs pour connexion ISO 11786 dans la cabine du tracteur     144\" suggests that the number 144 is linked to the ISO cable. \n\nBut the question is about the length of the extension cable. The number 144 could be a code or a part number, not a length. The context doesn't mention any specific length in meters. There's a mention of \"144\" associated with the ISO extension cable, but without additional context, it's unclear if that's a length.

The first part talks about a recommended flow point D and a setting of 12+1 (13), with a corresponding flow rate of 3.7 kg/min. Then there's a mention of using the fine dosing kit. Later, there's a calculation for the required flow rate: 27 m x 8 km/h x 25 kg/ha = 9 kg/min. Then it says to set the flow point to J and adjust the fine dosing to 21, which is 3x9=27 kg/min. \n\nBut the question is about the drain rate in liters per minute for the hopper emptying. The context mentions kg/min values, like 3.7 kg/min and 9 kg/min, but nothing about liters. The user is asking for liters per minute, but the context only provides kilogram per minute. There's no conversion factor given between kg and liters here, so I can't convert the kg/min to liters/min without additional info. \n\nAlso, the context mentions the hopper content dropping below 100 kg triggering a cutoff, but that's about the hopper's minimum content, not the drain rate.
