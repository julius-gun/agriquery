The user is asking about a specific precaution to take before working between the tractor and machine when checking the coupling shaft length. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The context is from a manual, likely for agricultural machinery, detailing setup and safety procedures. The relevant sections are around pages 50 and 51, which discuss the coupling shaft length adjustment and safety measures.\n\nLooking at page 50, there's a mention of placing the machine on a support before positioning oneself between the tractor and the machine. The key point here is that if you're between the tractor and the machine while operating the lifting device, there's a risk of the machine lowering unexpectedly, which could trap you and cause serious injury. The instruction says to cut the tractor's engine and remove the key from the ignition to prevent accidental movement.\n\nAdditionally, on page 51, there's a similar warning about not standing between the tractor and the machine during lifting or lowering operations. The same steps are mentioned: turning off the engine, removing the key, and applying the parking brake to ensure the machine can't move unexpectedly.\n\nSo the specific precaution is to ensure the tractor's engine is off, the key is removed, and the parking brake is engaged before working between the tractor and machine. This prevents any accidental movement that could lead to injury.\n</think>\n\n[Place the machine on a support before positioning yourself between the tractor and the machine.

However, the specific question is about the overlap when shortening. \n\nWait, the exact sentence is: \"Les tubes profilés doivent se chevaucher le plus possible et au moins sur 150 mm.\" So the minimum overlap is 150 mm. But there's another part that says when adjusting, the gap should be 25 mm. But the question is about the overlap when shortening. \n\nWait, the user is asking about shortening the coupling shaft. The context says: \"Raccourcissez les deux tubes profilés jusqu'à l'obtention d'un jeu de 25 mm.\" So when shortening, the gap (which is the space between the tubes) should be 25 mm. But the overlap would be the length they are overlapped. Wait, maybe the 150 mm is the minimum overlap required, and the 25 mm is the gap when they are at the same height. \n\nWait, the original instruction says: \"Les tubes profilés doivent se chevaucher le plus possible et au moins sur 150 mm.\" So the minimum overlap is 150 mm. But when shortening, they adjust to get a 25 mm gap. So the answer is 150 mm. But the question is about shortening the coupling shaft. Let me check again.\n\nThe question is: \"When shortening a coupling shaft, how far must profiled tubes at least overlap in mm?\" The context says that when shortening, the tubes must be shortened until there's a 25 mm gap.

The context is in French, so I need to be careful with the terminology. The term \"distribution meter\" might be translated as \"distributeur d'engrais\" or something similar. \n\nLooking through the pages, I see references to \"granulomètre\" on page 59. The granulomètre is a device used to determine the granulometry of fertilizer. The description mentions that it has 4 small compartments separated by seven others.

Wait, but the question is about the symbol on top of the handle indicating that the Fine kit is enabled. The text says that when using the Fine application, the lever has indications: 3 orifices for normal, 1 open and 2 closed for Fine. So the symbol for Fine is 1 open circle and 2 closed ones.

Therefore, the symbol is 1 open circle (orifice) with 2 closed ones. But the exact wording in the context is \"1 seul orifice rond ouvert et 2 orifices ronds fermés pour le dosage fin.\" So the symbol is a single open circle and two closed circles. However, the question is asking for the symbol that indicates the Fine application kit is enabled. The answer should be the symbol described here.

Let me check that. \n\nOn page 72, under \"Débit variable, à commande externe,\" there's a mention of \"Raccordement RS 232.\" The text says that the external system and the spreader's control system communicate via a serial port with an RS232 connector. The exact sentence is: \"Le système externe et le système de commande de l'épandeur avec boîtier de commande IsoMatch communiquent par le biais d'un port série avec une prise RS232.\" \n\nSo the answer should be RS232. I need to confirm there's no other mention of different serial connections elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, I don't see any other references to serial connections for the IsoMatch. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is RS232.\n</think>\n\nThe IsoMatch control box uses an RS232 serial connection for communication.",

Remplacez l'agitateur lorsque celui-ci est usé\" which translates to thoroughly clean the machine after each use and replace the agitator if it's worn out. \n\nAdditionally, on Page 153, there's another entry under problem 15, which mentions \"Il y a un obstacle à l'écoulement sur l'un des côtés\" (there's an obstacle to the flow on one side). The solution here is the same as on Page 152: clean the machine and replace the agitator if necessary.\n\nSo, the answer should mention both pages 152 and 153, but the user is asking specifically about the flow being blocked. The exact solution is to clean the machine and replace the agitator. The pages referenced are 152 and 153. However, the question is about the page to look at. The main entry for the blocked flow is on Page 152, and the related entry on 153 might be a duplicate or a specific case. But since the user is asking for the page to look, the primary answer would be Page 152. However, the context might have both entries. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the exact entries:\n\nOn Page 152, problem 6: \"L'écoulement de l'engrais est entravé\" with solution to clean and replace agitator.\n\nOn Page 153, problem 15: \"Il y a un obstacle à l'écoulement sur l'un des côtés\" with the same solution.\n\nSo, both pages 152 and 153 have relevant information. However, the user's question is about the flow being blocked. The answer should specify both pages, but the instruction says to be precise. The exact answer would be to refer to Page 152 and 153. But the user might be looking for the primary page. Alternatively, maybe the answer is to check both pages. However, the instruction says to extract the exact information. The answer should be the pages mentioned in the context. Let me check the exact text.\n\nIn the context, the solution for blocked flow is mentioned on Page 152 (problem 6) and again on Page 153 (problem 15). Therefore, the answer should mention both pages. But the user's question is \"at what page should I look?\" So the answer is to look at pages 152 and 153. However, the answer format requires a concise answer. The exact answer would be: \"Nettoyez à fond la machine après chaque utilisation. Remplacez l'agitateur lorsque celui-ci est usé. Voir pages 152 et 153.\" But the user might want the page numbers. Alternatively, the answer might be that the solution is on page 152 and 153. But the user's question is about the page to look. The answer should be the pages where the solution is found. So the answer is pages 152 and 153. However, the user might be looking for the specific page. Let me check the exact text again.\n\nIn the context, the problem 6 on page 152 and problem 15 on page 153 both mention the same solution. Therefore, the answer is to refer to pages 152 and 153. But the user's question is \"at what page should I look?\" So the answer is pages 152 and 153. However, the answer format requires a concise answer. The answer should be: \"Nettoyez à fond la machine après chaque utilisation. Remplacez l'agitateur lorsque celui-ci est usé. Voir pages 152 et 153.\" But the user might want the page numbers. Alternatively, the answer is to look at page 152 and 153. But the exact answer based on the context is that the solution is on pages 152 and 153. Therefore, the answer should be those pages.\n</think>\n\nNet",

However, I need to focus on parts that discuss cost or expense.\n\nIn the section about \"Dosage fin\" on page 24, it talks about the fine dosage setup and how it's used for underground manure spreading. It mentions that the fine dosage requires adjusting the orifices and that it's designed to handle low flow rates without clogging. But there's no mention of cost here.\n\nLooking further, on page 25, there's a part about reducing the working width during passes and using GPS data to optimize spreading. Again, this is about efficiency and coverage, not cost. \n\nThe section on page 27 discusses the MULTIRATE system and how it can apply different doses in a single pass, but this is about functionality and not cost. \n\nI need to check if there's any mention of cost or expense related to the fine application versus normal dosing. Scanning through the entire context again, I don't see any direct comparison of costs between the two methods. The text focuses on technical aspects, safety, and operational procedures, but not on financial implications. \n\nSince there's no information in the context about the cost difference between fine application and normal dosing, the correct answer would be that it's not found in the context.

It mentions that the ExactLine system allows spreading from the first spray row to the edge. The context also states that it's possible to spread to the edge on the left or right. \n\nBut the question is about small gardens. The context mentions that for smaller fields, you can set a shorter interval. However, the exact mention of small gardens isn't there.

The ExactLine system is mentioned as allowing spreading to the edge, but does it specify suitability for small gardens? The context doesn't explicitly say \"small gardens,\" but \"parcelles plus petites\" (smaller fields) might refer to small gardens. Since the system can adjust intervals for smaller fields, it implies that one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for them. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there's a direct statement. The answer should be based on the context.

The user is asking, \"For what other kind of connections can the IM Tellus Input cable be used?\" So, I need to find information in the provided context that answers this.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for mentions of \"IM Tellus Input cable\" or related terms. Looking at the context, there's a section on page 34 discussing the IsoMatch Tellus GO and the cable connections. Specifically, there's a mention of \"Raccordement au tracteur ISOBUS par câble avec connecteur 9 broches pour 'IsoMatch Tellus'\".

The user is asking, \"How should one proceed to stop spreading the fertilizer?\" They want a precise answer based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to scan through the context to find any instructions related to stopping the fertilizer spread. The context is in French, so I'll have to read carefully. \n\nLooking at the pages, there's a section on \"Utilisation dans les champs\" (Field Use) and \"Procédure en bout de champ\" (End-of-field Procedure). On page 101, there's a part about stopping the spreading. Let me check that.\n\nThe relevant part says: \" Fermez les unités de dosage en appuyant sur la touche 'STOP' pour effectuer le demi-tour sur tournière.\" Translating that, it means \"Close the dosage units by pressing the 'STOP' button to perform the half-turn on the tournette.\" \n\nAdditionally, on page 103, under \"Épandage en bout de champ sans le GEOCONTROL,\" it mentions stopping the spread by closing the dosage units when there's half the width left. But the main instruction for stopping is on page 101. \n\nSo the answer should be to press the 'STOP' button to close the dosage units and perform the half-turn. That's the direct instruction from the context. I need to make sure there's no other conflicting info. The rest of the context talks about starting, adjusting settings, but stopping is specifically mentioned here. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is to press the 'STOP' button to close the dosage units and make the half-turn.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nPress the \"STOP\" button to close the dosage units and perform the half-turn on the tournette.",

The question specifically mentions \"without GEOCONTROL headland,\" so I should focus on sections that discuss spreading without GEOCONTROL.\n\nOn page 107, there's a section about the hydraulic border deflector. It mentions that the maximum allowed loss beyond the field border is defined by an environmental standard. The fertilizer spread beyond the border can be up to 10% of the amount spread at the center. However, this refers to the amount, not the height. \n\nAnother part on page 107 talks about the deflector settings: mode \"environment\" vs. \"yield.\" The \"environment\" mode reduces the amount near the border, but again, this is about quantity, not height. \n\nLooking for any mention of height, I might have missed something. Wait, the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. The context doesn't mention anything about the height of the fertilizer application. It discusses spread patterns, recouvrement percentages, and environmental standards, but not the vertical height. \n\nSince there's no information about the height of the fertilizer application when using the deflector without GEOCONTROL, the answer should be that it's not found in the context.

The term \"seven-sided\" might be a mistranslation or a specific term used in the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context given, there are several mentions of boundary spreading techniques using different systems like ExactLine and hydraulic border spreading plates. The context talks about unilaternal spreading with a hydraulic border plate, which involves adjusting the spreader's position to cover the field's edge. However, the term \"seven-sided\" isn't directly mentioned. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of a seven-sided boundary or a seven-sided spreading method. Scanning through the pages, the context discusses different modes like situation A and B, and the use of ExactLine and hydraulic deflectors. There's a mention of the hydraulic border spreading plate (déflecteur de bordure hydraulique) and how it's used to adjust the spread width. However, there's no reference to a seven-sided boundary. \n\nThe user might be confusing \"seven-sided\" with another term, perhaps a mistranslation of \"unilateral\" or \"single-sided.\" Alternatively, \"seven-sided\" could refer to a specific configuration or a part of the equipment, but based on the provided context, there's no such mention. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide information about a seven-sided boundary spreading method using the hydraulic border plate, the correct response would be that the information isn't found in the context.

The user is asking how the rate of corrosion on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD compares between machines used in coastal versus inland agricultural regions.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant information in the provided context. The context is a manual for a machine, likely agricultural, discussing safety, maintenance, and usage. The question is about corrosion rates in different environments.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section under \"Maintenance\" and \"Sécurité\" (Safety). Specifically, there's a part that mentions corrosion. Let me scan for keywords like \"corrosion\" or \"engrais\" (fertilizer) since those might relate to the environment affecting the machine.\n\nHere's a relevant paragraph: \"L'engrais et d'autres salages ont une grande influence sur la vitesse de corrosion. Videz la trémie une fois les opérations achevées. Protégez la machine en la nettoyant après chaque utilisation et en corrigeant les dommages au niveau de la peinture. La corrosion atteint la solidité et le fonctionnement de la machine, réduisant extrêmement par conséquent sa durée de vie.\"\n\nThis translates to: \"Fertilizers and other contaminants have a significant influence on the rate of corrosion. Empty the hopper once operations are completed. Protect the machine by cleaning it after each use and correcting damage to the paint. Corrosion affects the solidity and functioning of the machine, drastically reducing its lifespan.\"\n\nSo the context states that fertilizers (engrais) and other contaminants (salages) influence the corrosion rate. Now, the question is about coastal vs. inland regions. Coastal areas might have more salt in the air (from sea spray), which is a type of contaminant. Inland areas might have different contaminants, perhaps more from fertilizers used in agriculture.\n\nThe manual doesn't explicitly compare coastal and inland regions. It only mentions that fertilizers and other contaminants affect corrosion. However, the user is asking for a comparison between the two regions. Since the context doesn't provide specific data on coastal vs. inland, the answer would have to be based on the information given.\n\nThe manual says that the presence of these contaminants (like fertilizers) increases corrosion. If coastal areas have more salt (a contaminant), then machines there would experience higher corrosion. Inland areas might have different contaminants, but the manual doesn't specify. Therefore, the answer would be that the corrosion rate is higher in coastal regions due to salt, but the context doesn't directly compare the two. However, the user's question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD, which is mentioned in the context. Wait, the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD is part of the machine's description. The manual mentions that the machine is used for spreading fertilizers, so the corrosion is influenced by the use of fertilizers. But the question is about coastal vs. inland. The manual doesn't mention coastal regions, so the answer would be that the context doesn't provide a direct comparison. However, the user might infer that coastal areas have more salt, leading to higher corrosion. But since the context doesn't explicitly state that, the correct answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions. Wait, the user's question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD, which is part of the machine described. The manual mentions that the machine is used for spreading fertilizers, and that fertilizers and other contaminants affect corrosion. However, the manual doesn't mention coastal vs. inland regions.

The context is a manual for a machine, so it's likely to have safety guidelines. Let me scan through the sections related to safety and protective equipment.\n\nLooking at the \"Contact avec les produits dangereux\" section on page 22, it mentions that during cleaning, you might come into contact with hazardous products. It advises wearing protective clothing, including gloves, safety shoes, and eye protection. Specifically, it says to wear \"des gants protecteurs\" which translates to protective gloves. \n\nAdditionally, there's a mention of nitrate-based fertilizers having an explosion risk if exposed to fire. The context says to remove fertilizer residues from orifices, angles, etc., before welding. However, the direct answer about gloves is in the contact section. \n\nThe question is about gloves needed for cleaning fertilizer remnants before welding. The context doesn't specify different gloves for welding, but the general advice is to use protective gloves. Since the exact type isn't specified beyond \"protective gloves,\" the answer should be that. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of gloves in the context. Scanning through other sections, like maintenance or safety during operations, there's no additional info on gloves. So the answer is protective gloves as per the contact section.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nProtective gloves (gants protecteurs) are required when cleaning fertilizer remnants from the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD before welding.",

On page 32, there's a mention of the ISOBUS communication protocol and how it's used between the terminal and the machine. It also talks about the IsoMatch Tellus system. However, the specific technical specs and bandwidth capabilities aren't detailed here.\n\nFurther down, on page 34, there's a section about the IsoMatch Tellus GO, which is a version of the IsoMatch system. It mentions that it uses a single screen and has fewer USB ports and no WLAN/WIFI compared to the standard IsoMatch Tellus. However, this doesn't directly address the ISOBUS protocol versions or their bandwidth.\n\nAnother part on page 32 mentions that the ISOBUS protocol is used for communication between the terminal and the machine, allowing specific processing of location and reacting to field anomalies. It also states that GPS, various sensors, and the management system provide necessary data for optimal machine guidance. But again, there's no mention of different protocol versions or their bandwidth.\n\nLooking for terms like \"versions\" or \"bandwidth,\" I don't see any explicit information. The context seems to focus more on the functionality and components of the ISOBUS system rather than the protocol versions themselves. There's a mention of the ISOBUS protocol version 06.00.00.0257 in relation to the GreenSeeker sensor, but that's a specific sensor's software version, not the ISOBUS protocol.\n\nSince the question is about the ISOBUS protocol versions and their bandwidth capabilities, and the context doesn't provide specific details on different versions or their bandwidth, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context.

Baud rate is the rate at which data is transmitted over a communication channel, measured in bits per second. However, the context here is about an RS232 connection, which is a standard for serial communication. The question is about the minimum baud rate required for this connection.\n\nLooking through the context, I remember that on Page 72, there's a section about the RS232 connection. Let me check that part again. The text mentions: \"Le brochage du connecteur RS232 9 broches et les réglages nécessaires figurent dans → le manuel d'utilisation du boîtier de commande IsoMatch Tellus.\" \n\nWait, that's in French.

The context is a manual for using a spreader machine in fields, discussing different methods like GEOCONTROL, border spreading with deflectors, and ExactLine systems. \n\nLooking through the pages, specifically page 109 mentions two situations: Situation A (using spray paths) and Situation B (without spray paths). In Situation A, the first passage is done with the tractor's center about 2 meters from the field edge. Then, the second passage is in the first spray path. \n\nThe question is about the 'first path' distance tolerance. The term 'first path' might refer to the initial pass when setting up for border spreading. In Situation A, the first passage is 2 meters from the edge. However, the exact term 'distance tolerance' isn't used, but the context specifies 2 meters as the distance from the edge for the first pass. \n\nI need to check if there's any mention of tolerance or allowable deviation. The context doesn't explicitly state a tolerance range, but the instruction is to drive 2 meters from the edge. Since the question asks for the distance tolerance, and the context only gives the exact distance (2 meters) without mentioning a range, the answer should be 2 meters. \n\nOther pages might have similar info, but page 109 is the key here.

But the user might have a different take. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 1.0 mm, but that's for the flow ring. The correct answer based on the context is that the exact dimension isn't provided. However, the user might have a different expectation. \n\nWait, looking again, the answer might be 1.0 mm, but that's for the distance between the flow ring and the spreader disk. The 'small crack of light' between the dosing baffles isn't measured.",

The user is asking about the type of 'feeler gauge' material recommended for checking the 'discharge bushing height'. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a feeler gauge is. It's a thin, flexible metal strip used to measure small gaps. The question is specifically about the material recommended for this particular check.\n\nLooking through the provided context, I remember there were sections about maintenance and adjustments. Let me scan through the pages again. \n\nOn page 137, there's a mention of measuring the distance between the inner side of the rope and the opening of the flow ring. It says to respect the distance of 109 mm. Then, if the distance is not correct, they mention adjusting the electric cylinder plate. \n\nWait, there's also a part on page 139 where they talk about placing plates of 1.0 mm thickness between the flow ring and the spreader disk. The text says, \"vous pouvez également placer des plaques d'une épaisseur de 1,0 mm entre la bague d'écoulement et le disque d'épandage et y laisser reposer la bague d'écoulement.\" \n\nSo, the context mentions using plates (plaques) of 1.0 mm thickness. But the question is about the material of the feeler gauge. The term \"plaques\" here refers to thin metal sheets, which are typically made of metal. However, the exact material isn't specified in the context. The user is asking for the type of material recommended. \n\nWait, the context doesn't explicitly state the material. It just mentions the thickness. The answer might be that the material isn't specified, but the question is about the type. However, in the absence of specific information, the answer might be that the material isn't mentioned, so the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". \n\nBut wait, the user is asking about the 'feeler gauge' material. The context mentions using plates (plaques) of 1.0 mm, which are likely made of metal. However, the exact material (like steel, brass, etc.) isn't specified. Since the context doesn't mention the material, the correct answer would be that it's not found in the context. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term 'feeler gauge' is being referred to as the plates used. But the question is about the material. Since the context doesn't specify, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\".\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The text mentions \"joint d'étanchéité en plastique\" which translates to \"plastic seal.\" The instruction says to replace this seal at the start of each season and every 100 hours of use. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about the material specification. The context states that the agitator axle has a plastic seal to prevent granules from leaking along the axle. The exact material isn't mentioned beyond \"plastic,\" but maybe there's more detail. Let me check again.\n\nIn the part about replacing the seal, it says \"Remplacez le joint d'étanchéité en plastique.\" That's \"Replace the plastic seal.\" There's no specific type of plastic mentioned, like nylon or Teflon. The context only refers to it as \"plastic\" without further details. \n\nSo the answer should state that the material is plastic, as that's the only specification given.
