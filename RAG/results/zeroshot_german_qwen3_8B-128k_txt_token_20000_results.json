Looking at the sections about the machine's general information, there's a part discussing dosing settings. \n\nIn Page 24, under \"Genaue Einstellung\" and \"Dosis,\" there's a mention of \"Feindosierung\" (fine dosing). It says, \"Im Feindosierstand sind 2 der 3 Dosieröffnungen geschlossen.\" Translating that, it means \"In the fine dosing position, 2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed.\" \n\nSo, during fine application (Feindosierung), two dosing openings are closed. The answer should be 2. I need to confirm there's no other mention of this in other pages. Checking other sections, like Page 25 and 26, they discuss the spread pattern and adjustments but don't mention the number of closed openings in fine application. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is 2.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n2",

The text says: \"Der ISOBUS unterstützt den Farmfacts GreenSeeker Sensor. Ab der GreenSeeker-Version 06.00.00.00.0257 unterstützt die Software den Empfang des externen Signals.\"\n\nSo, the key part here is \"GreenSeeker-Version 06.00.00.00.0257\". That's the version number where the ISOBUS starts supporting the signal reception. The answer should be this version number. I need to make sure there's no other mention of versions related to this.

It says, \"Normalerweise ist das Streubild ein Dreieck mit vollständiger Überlappung.\" That translates to \"Normally, the spreading pattern is a triangle with complete overlap.\" So the overlap percentage here is 100%.\n\nAnother part on page 28 mentions \"Das Streubild bei Flächendüngung wird zu 100 % überlappt\" which means \"The spreading pattern during area fertilization is overlapped by 100%.\" This confirms the same 100% overlap.\n\nI should check if there are any other mentions, but these two sections clearly state 100% overlap for the full field spreading pattern.

The user is asking, \"What system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread?\" I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of systems that measure fertilizer quantity. The context is in German, so I need to be careful with the terms. Let me look for keywords like \"measure,\" \"system,\" \"fertilizer,\" \"quantity,\" or \"spread.\"\n\nLooking through the pages, I see sections about the machine's technical data, safety instructions, and some parts related to the spreader. On page 31, there's a section titled \"Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min)\" which mentions the computer calculating the required discharge speed based on formula. Then, there's a part about the spreader measuring the amount of fertilizer using weight cells. \n\nSpecifically, on page 31, it says: \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" Translating that, it means the spreader measures the amount of fertilizer being spread using weight cells. \n\nAnother part on page 31 mentions the computer comparing the measured value with the set dose and adjusting the spreader's opening. So the system involves the spreader's weight cells and the computer processing the data. \n\nPutting this together, the answer should mention the weight cells (Wägezellen) in the spreader and the computer system. But the question asks for the system, so the main system is the spreader's measurement system using weight cells. However, the exact term in the context is \"Wägezellen\" which are weight cells. The system is the spreader's measurement system, but the precise answer from the context is \"Wägezellen\" or the weight cells. \n\nWait, the question is about the system that continuously measures. The context says the spreader uses weight cells to measure the amount continuously. So the answer is the weight cells system. But the exact wording in the context is \"Wägezellen\" which translates to weight cells. Therefore, the answer should be the weight cells (Wägezellen) in the spreader. However, the user might expect the system name. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at page 31: \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" So the system is the weight cells (Wägezellen) in the spreader. Therefore, the answer is the weight cells system. But the exact term is \"Wägezellen,\" which is the system. So the answer is \"Wägezellen\" or \"weight cells.\" Since the user wants the exact information from the context, the answer is \"Wägezellen\" or the system mentioned. However, the question is in English, so the answer should be in English. The context mentions \"Wägezellen\" which is weight cells. Therefore, the system is the weight cells. But the answer should be precise. The exact sentence is \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" So the system is the weight cells (Wägezellen) in the spreader. Therefore, the answer is \"weight cells\" or \"Wägezellen.\" Since the user wants the answer in English, it's \"weight cells.\" But I need to check if there's a specific system name. Alternatively, the system might be referred to as the \"automatische Wiegesystem\" (automatic weighing system) mentioned on page 30. Let me check page 30: \"Das automatische Wiegesystem\" which is the automatic weighing system. So the system is the automatic weighing system. But the exact mention is \"Wägezellen\" on page 31. So the answer is the automatic weighing system, which uses weight cells. But the question is about the system that continuously measures. The answer is the automatic weighing system. However, the exact term in the context is \"automatisches Wiegesystem\" on page 30. Let me confirm. \n\nOn page 30: \"Das automatische Wiegesystem\" (The automatic weighing system). Then on page 31: \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger...\" So the system is the automatic weighing system, which uses weight cells. Therefore, the answer is the automatic weighing system. But the user wants the exact information from the context. The exact answer is \"automatisches Wiegesystem\" but in English, it's \"automatic weighing system.\" However, the context also mentions \"Wägezellen\" which are the weight cells. The question is about the system, so the answer is the automatic weighing system. But I need to check if the context explicitly states that this system",

The user is asking, \"How often does the spreader carry out automatic calibration tests?\" I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of automatic calibration tests. The context is quite technical, so I need to look for keywords like \"calibration,\" \"test,\" or \"automatic.\"\n\nLooking through the pages, I see on page 31 under \"Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min)\" there's a section that mentions automatic calibration. The relevant part says: \"Wenn der Behälterinhalt unter 100 kg beträgt, schaltet das Bediensystem die automatische Kalibrierung aus.\" This translates to \"When the container content is below 100 kg, the control system switches off the automatic calibration.\"\n\nBut the question is about how often the spreader performs these tests. Wait, the context mentions that automatic calibration is disabled when the container is under 100 kg, but it doesn't explicitly state the frequency. However, there's another part on page 31: \"Die Genauigkeit der Messung nimmt dermaßen ab, dass mit einer neuen, automatischen Kalibrierung keine bessere Auslasskurve erzielt werden kann.\" This suggests that the automatic calibration is performed when the container is below 100 kg, but it's not clear if it's a regular interval or triggered by the container level.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The context mentions that the spreader uses automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or each minute. Wait, looking back at page 31: \"mit den automatischen Abdrehtests, die der Streuer alle 75 kg oder jede Minute ausführt\" which translates to \"with the automatic rotation tests, which the spreader performs every 75 kg or each minute.\" But the question is about calibration tests, not rotation tests. However, the context might be referring to calibration as part of these tests.\n\nWait, the exact sentence is: \"Automatische Abdrehprobe mit den Daten aus dem Streutabellenbuch und mit den automatischen Abdrehtests, die der Streuer alle 75 kg oder jede Minute ausführt, bestimmt der Computer, welcher Dosierstand welcher Auslassgeschwindigkeit entspricht.\" So the automatic rotation tests (Abdrehtests) are performed every 75 kg or each minute. But the question is about calibration tests. However, the context might be using \"Abdrehtests\" as part of the calibration process. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the calibration tests are done every time the container is below 100 kg, but that's when it's disabled. The answer might be that the spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or each minute. But I need to check if \"Abdrehtests\" are considered calibration tests here. The term \"Abdrehtests\" translates to \"rotation tests\" or \"turning tests,\" which might be part of the calibration process. \n\nGiven that the context mentions the spreader performs these tests every 75 kg or each minute, and the question is about how often the spreader carries out automatic calibration tests, the answer would be every 75 kg or each minute. However, the exact term used in the context is \"automatischen Abdrehtests,\" which might be a specific type of test. But since the user's question is about calibration, and the context doesn't explicitly mention the frequency of calibration tests beyond the container level, the answer might be that the spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or each minute. \n\nWait, the exact sentence is: \"Automatische Abdrehprobe mit den Daten aus dem Streutabellenbuch und mit den automatischen Abdrehtests, die der Streuer alle 75 kg oder jede Minute ausführt, bestimmt der Computer, welcher Dosierstand welcher Auslassgeschwindigkeit entspricht.\" So the automatic rotation tests (Abdrehtests) are performed every 75 kg or each minute. If these tests are part of the calibration process, then the answer would be every 75 kg or each minute. However, the question is about calibration tests, and the context might not explicitly state that these are calibration tests. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be that the spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or each minute. Since the context mentions these tests are done at those intervals, even if the term used is \"Abdrehtests,\" it's possible that this is the intended answer. Therefore, the answer is that the spreader carries out automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or each minute.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader performs automatic calibration tests every 75 kg or each minute.",

The context is a detailed manual for a machine, probably agricultural, involving various safety instructions, technical data, and setup procedures. The specific part relevant here is about the IsoMatch terminal and how it interfaces with the tractor.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section on page 32 discussing the ISOBUS system. It mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz (power supply cable set) can be used. The text says that this cable set allows the tractor to be connected to the IsoMatch terminal, enabling the transmission of the tractor's speed via the ISOBUS. \n\nWait, but the question is about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. The context says that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you can use the IsoMatch power cable set to add ISOBUS communication. So the answer would involve using that cable set to enable the communication, allowing the speed data to be transmitted. \n\nAnother part on page 41 mentions that for non-ISO tractors, an additional cable set is needed, which is the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz. This cable set allows the tractor to be upgraded to have ISOBUS communication, thus enabling the speed data transfer. \n\nSo the key point is that the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to provide the necessary ISOBUS communication, which then allows the speed data to be sent to the IsoMatch. Therefore, the answer should state that the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to enable ISOBUS communication, thereby transmitting the speed data.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch via the **IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz** (power supply cable set), which enables ISOBUS communication on non-ISO tractors.

The question is about operating time before re-checking nuts and bolts. Let me look for keywords like \"check,\" \"nuts and bolts,\" \"maintenance,\" \"repairs,\" or \"operating time.\"\n\nLooking at Page 38, there's a section under \"Vor dem ersten Gebrauch\" (Before first use).

It mentions that if a suitable location isn't available, the user needs to provide a footplate. The steps include welding a footplate to a selected area in the cabin.

Looking at the sections about the machine's setup and technical data, there's a part on page 64 under \"Arbeitsbreite\" (Working Width). \n\nThe context says: \"Um den Streuer einzustellen, müssen Sie zuerst die Arbeitsbreite wählen, auf der Sie streuen wollen. Dies kann z. B. der Abstand zwischen den Streuspuren sein.\" So, the working width is determined by the distance between the spreading tracks. \n\nAdditionally, there's a mention that the working width is set using the correct coupling point for the universal joint, along with the spindle speed and the outlet opening.

But the question is asking what determines the working width. The answer should be the combination of these three factors. However, the exact wording in the context is that the working width is determined by the coupling point of the universal joint on the gearbox, along with the spindle speed and outlet opening. \n\nWait, the exact sentence from the context is: \"Die Arbeitsbreite des Streuers wird durch den gewählten Anschlusspunkt der Gelenkwelle am Getriebe mitbestimmt.\" So, the working width is determined by the selected coupling point of the universal joint on the gearbox.

The symbol is likely a visual indicator on the handle showing this configuration. \n\nLooking back at the context, there's an image reference on page 67 with images of the handle in different positions. The exact symbol would be the one showing 1 open and 2 closed openings. Since the user is asking for the symbol, the answer should describe this configuration. \n\nTherefore, the symbol is a handle with 1 open round opening and 2 closed openings, indicating the Fine application kit is enabled.\n</think>\n\nThe symbol is a handle with **1 open round opening** and **2 closed openings** (indicating the Fine application kit is enabled).",

Looking at the sections about setting up the spreader and calculating flow rates, there's a part that stands out. On page 68, there's a formula mentioned: \n\n\"Benötigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha) / 600\"\n\nThat seems to be the formula they're using. Let me check if there are other mentions. On page 69, there's an example calculation using this formula, which reinforces that this is the correct one. \n\nThe formula takes into account the working width in meters, speed in km/h, and the application rate in kg/ha, then divides by 600 to get kg/min.

The ExactLine is described as a device used for border spreading, and the hydraulic system is another method. \n\nIn the section about the ExactLine on page 107, it's mentioned that there are two settings: YIELD and ECO. The YIELD setting allows more spreading towards the field edge but results in higher loss, while ECO minimizes loss but may not fill the edge as well.

However, the exact answer might be that the vanes (Schaufeln) are checked during the maintenance intervals specified in the manual, but since the exact interval isn't explicitly stated in the provided text, the answer might be that they are checked during regular maintenance as per the intervals listed, but without specific numbers, the answer might be \"during regular maintenance intervals\" or \"as per the maintenance schedule.\"\n\nWait, looking again at page 125, the \"Wartungsintervalle\" table lists \"Zustand Schaufeln\" under point 4, which is to be checked \"nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden\" (after the first 10 operating hours), \"für jede Saison\" (for each season), \"nach allen 100 Betriebsstunden\" (after every 100 operating hours), and \"für den Fall, dass das Streubild der linken und rechten Streuscheibe mehr als 3 % abweicht\" (if the spread pattern of the left and right spreader blades deviates by more than 3%). \n\nSo the answer would be that the condition of the vanes (Schaufeln) must be inspected after the first 10 hours of operation, for each season, after every 100 hours of operation, and if there's a deviation in the spread pattern. However, the question is asking for the interval, so the answer would be the intervals mentioned: after the first 10 hours, every season, and every 100 hours. But the exact answer might be that they are checked during the maintenance intervals specified in the manual, which include after 10 hours, every season, and every 100 hours. \n\nBut the user wants the exact answer from the context.

The context provided is a manual for a spreader machine, so I need to look through the sections related to maintenance and adjustments.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the table of contents for sections mentioning bushing or discharge settings. On page 134, there's a section about the dosing mechanism adjustment. The instruction says to check and adjust the dosing mechanism after the first 10 hours of operation, every season, after every 100 hours, and if the spread pattern differs by more than 3%. \n\nWait, the question is about bushing height and discharge settings. The term \"bushing\" might refer to the bearing or a part of the mechanism. Looking at page 134, the section mentions checking the dosing mechanism's position, ensuring the dosing plates have a small gap. Also, on page 136, there's a part about checking the discharge opening's position, mentioning the distance between the cable's inner side and the outlet pipe's opening should be 109 mm. \n\nBut the user specifically asked about the interval for checking bushing height and setting discharge. The key part is in the maintenance intervals. On page 125, under \"Wartungsintervalle\" (maintenance intervals), there's a list of tasks. For example, item 9 mentions \"Schmieren\" (lubricate) and item 10 refers to lubricating the drive shaft's quick-release fittings. However, the exact mention of bushing height and discharge settings is in the dosing mechanism checks. \n\nLooking back at page 133, the \"Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus\" (Check and Adjustment of Dosing Mechanism) section states that the dosing mechanism should be checked after the first 10 hours, every season, after every 100 hours, and if the spread pattern differs by more than 3%. This seems to relate to the discharge settings. \n\nThe bushing height might be part of the dosing mechanism adjustment. Since the user is asking for the interval, the answer would be the same as the dosing mechanism checks. Therefore, the intervals are after the first 10 hours, every season, after every 100 hours, and when the spread pattern deviates by more than 3%.\n</think>\n\nThe bushing height and discharge settings must be checked and adjusted after the first 10 hours of operation, every season, after every 100 hours of use, and when the spread pattern deviation exceeds 3%.",

The question is about replacement intervals. Let me scan through the context.\n\nLooking at the pages, on page 140, there's a section about replacing the agitator seal. The text says: \"Die Rührerwelle ist mit einer Kunststoffdichtung versehen, um zu vermeiden, dass Sie Kunstdüngerkörner entlang der Rührerwelle verlieren. Die Dichtung muss jede Saison und nach jeweils 100 Betriebsstunden der Maschine ausgetauscht werden.\" \n\nTranslating that, it means the agitator seal (Kunststoffdichtung) must be replaced every season and after every 100 hours of operation. So the answer should state both intervals: seasonal and every 100 hours. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of the agitator seal elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, I don't see another reference. The key points are \"jede Saison\" (every season) and \"nach jeweils 100 Betriebsstunden\" (after each 100 operating hours). \n\nSo the precise answer is that the agitator seal must be replaced every season and every 100 hours of operation.

The user's question is about the material, and the context doesn't provide that information. Therefore, the correct response is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

From the context provided, the tray test, or Streumengentest, is a method to check the distribution of fertilizer or similar materials using a series of containers placed along the field. The context mentions that the test should be done under specific weather conditions.\n\nLooking through the pages, specifically Page 77, there's a section about the tray test. It says: \"Führen Sie den Streumengentest bei trockenem Wetter, geringer Luftfeuchtigkeit und einer maximalen Windgeschwindigkeit von 3 m/s (Windstärke 2) aus.\" Translating that, the test should be conducted on dry weather, low humidity, and maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force 2).

On page 85, there's a mention of the hydraulic border spreading plate (hydraulisches Grenzstreublech) and how to adjust it. It says, \"Verwenden Sie beim Streuen die korrekte Scheibendrehzahl.\" Which translates to using the correct disc rotation speed during spreading. There's also a part about adjusting the plate to positions 9 or 1 for more or less spreading at the edge. \n\nFurther down, on page 87, there's a section about the hydraulic border spreading plate's settings and how it's adjusted. It mentions that the plate is set according to the (Online-)Streutabelle, and the H2O position uses the standard mounted (short) plates. However, there's no explicit mention of pneumatic actuation here. \n\nLooking for the word \"pneumatisch\" or any reference to pneumatic systems, I don't see any direct mention.

The entire context seems to focus on hydraulic adjustments and settings for the border spreading plate, not pneumatic. \n\nSince there's no information indicating that the hydraulic border spreading plate is actuated pneumatically, the answer would be that it's not mentioned, so the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, the user's instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. But the context does mention the hydraulic system, so maybe the answer is that it's hydraulic, not pneumatic. Wait, the question is whether it can be actuated pneumatically. Since the context only talks about hydraulic actuation, the answer would be no, it's not mentioned as being pneumatically actuated.

The context is in German, so I'll need to parse through the sections carefully. \n\nLooking at the sections related to stopping the spread, there are several mentions. For example, on page 82, there's a step that says \"Stoppen Sie mit dem Streuen erst, wenn Sie mit dem Auffangbehälter mindestens eine Arbeitsbreite (z. B. 18 oder 24 Meter) passiert haben.\" This translates to stopping spreading when you've covered at least the working width with the catchment container. \n\nAnother mention is on page 100, where it says \"Stoppen Sie das Streuen, indem Sie die Dosiereinheiten der Maschine schließen, wenn Sie noch eine halbe Arbeitsbreite vom Parzellenende entfernt sind.\" So, you stop by closing the dosing units when you're half a working width away from the field end.\n\nAlso, on page 113, there's a part that says \"Das Streuen unverzüglich einstellen! Die Zapfwelle sofort abstellen!\" which means to immediately stop spreading and turn off the power take-off (Zapfwelle).\n\nPutting this together, the steps to stop spreading involve closing the dosing units when a certain distance from the field end is reached and turning off the power take-off. The exact answer should include these steps as per the context.\n</think>\n\nTo stop spreading fertilizer, close the dosing units when at least half the working width remains from the field end and immediately shut off the power take-off (Zapfwelle).",

The user mentioned \"seven-sided,\" which isn't directly mentioned. However, there's a mention of \"Stellungen bei der H2O-Stellung sind A bis D\" which translates to positions A to D for H2O setup. Maybe \"seven-sided\" is a mistranslation or refers to different positions or settings.\n\nWait, the context also talks about \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen mit der ExactLine\" (two-shaft border spreading with ExactLine) and \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech\" (single-shaft border spreading with hydraulic border plate). The user might be referring to a specific configuration or setting related to these systems.\n\nLooking for the term \"seven-sided,\" I don't see it. However, there's a mention of \"Stellungen\" (positions) for the hydraulic border plate, like A, B, C, D. Maybe the user is referring to the different positions (A-D) as sides? But that's four positions, not seven. Alternatively, maybe \"seven-sided\" refers to the number of adjustments or settings, but the context doesn't mention seven.\n\nAnother possibility is that \"seven-sided\" is a mistranslation of \"seven positions\" or \"seven settings.\" However, the context mentions positions A to D, which are four. There's also a mention of \"Transportstellung\" (transport position) and \"Umweltstellung\" (environmental position), which are two more. That makes six positions.

The ExactLine has positions like YIELD and ECO, but again, not seven. \n\nSince the exact term \"seven-sided\" isn't found in the context, the answer should state that it's not found.

Then, on page 93, there's a list of steps to make the machine road-ready, including checking the lights, brakes, and securing all parts. \n\nLooking further, page 112 has a section titled \"Beendigung der Arbeiten\" (End of Work), which lists steps to take after finishing work. The key points here are turning off the dosing units, shutting down the tractor, removing the key, applying the parking brake, cleaning the machine, and ensuring it's secure for transport. \n\nAlso, on page 113, there's a mention of stopping the spreading process immediately and turning off the power if there's a malfunction.

The question is about painting damaged parts before winter storage. \n\nI'll start by scanning the sections related to winter storage and maintenance. On page 121, under \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung\" (Preparation for Winter Storage), there's a mention of drying the machine and repairing any paint damage. The text says: \"Eventuelle Lackschäden ausbessern.\" which translates to \"Repair any paint damage.\"\n\nThen, looking for specific paint recommendations. On page 124, under \"Öl- und Fettvolumen\" (Oil and Grease Volume), there's a table with specifications. However, that seems unrelated to paint. \n\nContinuing to page 125, \"Wartungsintervalle\" (Maintenance Intervals) mentions checking and maintaining the machine. Not helpful here. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user is asking about paint, so I need to look for any mention of paint or coatings. \n\nLooking back at page 121, the text says: \"Eventuelle Lackschäden ausbessern.\" But there's no specific paint mentioned. However, in the same section, it says: \"Versehen Sie blanke Teile, wie Kolbenstangen der Hydraulikzylinder mit konservierendem Fett oder sprühen (blanke) Metallteile der Maschine mit Konservierungsmittel (mitgeliefert) zum Schutz vor Korrosion der Maschine ein.\" This translates to applying protective grease or spraying metal parts with conservation medium (supplied) to prevent corrosion. \n\nWait, but the question is about paint, not grease. The manual doesn't explicitly mention a specific paint. However, the user might be referring to the conservation medium mentioned. But the question specifies \"paint,\" so maybe the answer is that no specific paint is mentioned, and the manual recommends using the supplied conservation medium for metal parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the manual doesn't specify a particular paint, so the user should use a suitable paint. But according to the instructions, if the information isn't found, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nLooking through the entire context again, there's no mention of paint types or specific paint products. The only related part is the conservation medium for metal parts, which is a protective coating, not paint. Therefore, the answer would be that the context doesn't specify a particular paint, so the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking how the corrosion rate on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD machine compares between coastal and inland agricultural regions. \n\nFirst, I need to find information in the provided context that mentions corrosion and its relation to different environments. Let me scan through the context.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see a section under \"Wartung\" (Maintenance) that talks about protecting the machine from corrosion. It mentions that \"Kunstdünger und andere Salze haben großen Einfluss auf die Korrosionsgeschwindigkeit.\" Translating that, it says artificial fertilizers and other salts have a significant influence on the corrosion rate. \n\nNow, the question is about coastal vs. inland regions. Coastal areas typically have higher salt content in the air due to sea spray, while inland areas might have less salt. The context doesn't explicitly mention coastal or inland regions, but it does link corrosion to the presence of salts. \n\nSince the machine is used in agricultural settings, the type of fertilizer used might vary. However, the context doesn't specify differences between coastal and inland areas. The key point here is that salts (like those from fertilizers) increase corrosion. If coastal regions use more saline fertilizers or have higher salt exposure, corrosion would be higher there. But the context doesn't directly compare coastal and inland regions. \n\nThe answer must be based strictly on the context. Since there's no direct comparison, the answer should state that the context mentions salts affect corrosion but doesn't specify coastal vs. inland differences. However, the user might infer that coastal areas have more salt, leading to higher corrosion. But since the context doesn't explicitly state this, the safest answer is that the context links corrosion to salts but doesn't compare coastal and inland regions. However, the user's question might expect an answer based on the given info. Wait, the context says \"Kunstdünger und andere Salze haben großen Einfluss auf die Korrosionsgeschwindigkeit.\" So, if coastal areas have more salts (from sea spray or fertilizers), corrosion would be higher. But the context doesn't explicitly say that. Therefore, the answer should be that the context indicates salts (like fertilizers) influence corrosion rate, but it doesn't directly compare coastal vs. inland regions. However, the user might expect an answer based on the given info. Wait, the question is about the machine's corrosion rate in coastal vs. inland. The context doesn't mention coastal or inland, so the answer should be that the context doesn't provide a direct comparison. But the user might want to know that salts (from fertilizers) affect corrosion, so if coastal areas have more salts, corrosion is higher. But since the context doesn't specify, the answer should be that the context links corrosion to salts but doesn't compare coastal vs. inland.

The user is asking for the minimum 'baud rate' for the 'RS 232 connection' based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what baud rate means. Baud rate refers to the rate at which data is transferred, typically measured in bits per second. However, the context here is about a RS 232 connection, which is a serial communication standard. The question is specifically about the minimum baud rate required for this connection.\n\nLooking through the context provided, I need to find any mention of RS 232 and baud rates. Let me scan through the pages. \n\nOn Page 72, there's a section titled \"Variable, extern gesteuerte Dosis\" (Variable, externally controlled dose). In that section, there's a mention of an RS 232 connection. The text says: \"Das Bediensystem Ihres Streuers in Kombination mit dem Bedienpult IsoMatch sendet die angewandte Dosis und Arbeitsbreite zudem zurück an das externe System. Das externe System und das Steuersystem des Streuers mit dem IsoMatch-Bedienpult kommunizieren untereinander über einen seriellen Anschluss (sogenannte RS 232-Verbindung).

The context doesn't specify any baud rate values. The user is asking for the minimum baud rate, but the provided text doesn't include that information. \n\nI need to check if there's any other part of the context that mentions baud rates. Let me go through other pages quickly. \n\nLooking through other sections, there's a lot about dosing, spreader settings, calibration, etc., but nothing about baud rates or RS 232 specifications beyond the connection details. \n\nSince the context doesn't mention the baud rate for the RS 232 connection, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context. The user might be expecting a standard baud rate like 9600, but since the context doesn't specify, I should adhere to the instruction to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer here is that the minimum baud rate isn't mentioned in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mentions of chunk size or blockage related to fertilizer. The context is mostly about spreading fertilizers, different types, and equipment settings. \n\nLooking at the sections about fraktionierung (fractionation) and spezifisches Gewicht (specific weight), there's a part that mentions the size of fertilizer particles. On page 59, there's a note that says: \"Wenn der Durchmesser der Kunstdüngerkörner zu 10 % oder mehr geringer als 2,0 mm ist, ist dieser Kunstdünger schwer zu verteilen...\" which translates to if 10% or more of the fertilizer particles are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to spread. But this is about small particles causing issues, not chunks.\n\nWait, the question is about 'chunk' size, which might refer to larger particles. Let me check again. On page 59, there's a mention of particles larger than 4.75 mm: \"Wenn der Durchmesser der Kunstdüngerkörner zu 20 % oder mehr größer als 4,75 mm ist, ist diese Kunstdüngersorte mit einer optimalen Verteilung zu verteilen. Erntegutschäden können auftreten, da die Körner Löcher in den Blättern des Ernteguts verursachen.\" So particles larger than 4.75 mm can cause damage, but it's about larger particles, not chunks.\n\nWait, maybe the term 'chunk' refers to particles that are too large, causing blockages. The context mentions that if more than 20% of the particles are larger than 4.75 mm, they can cause issues. However, the question is about the maximum acceptable chunk size to prevent blockage. The context doesn't explicitly state a maximum chunk size. However, in the fraktionierung section, the sieve sizes are mentioned. The first sieve is 2.0 mm, then 3.3 mm, 4.75 mm. The note says that if more than 10% are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to spread. But for blockage, maybe the chunks are the ones that are too large. However, the context doesn't specify a maximum chunk size. \n\nWait, looking back, the user's question is about the maximum acceptable chunk size to prevent blockage. The context mentions that if the diameter is 2.0 mm or more, but the exact value for chunk size isn't directly stated. However, in the fraktionierung section, the sieve sizes are 2.0 mm, 3.3 mm, 4.75 mm. The note says that if more than 20% of the particles are larger than 4.75 mm, they can cause issues. But the question is about preventing blockage, which might be related to particles that are too large. However, the context doesn't explicitly state a maximum chunk size. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that the maximum acceptable chunk size is 2.0 mm. Because if particles are smaller than 2.0 mm, they are considered too small and cause issues. But the question is about chunks, which are larger. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the maximum chunk size is 4.75 mm. But the context doesn't directly state that. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the fraktionierung section, the sieve sizes are 2.0 mm, 3.3 mm, 4.75 mm.

In agricultural machinery, a \"tap\" could refer to a valve or a control mechanism.\n\nLooking at the provided context, there's a section discussing the hydraulic border spreading plate, also known as a hydraulic border spreader. The context mentions adjusting the hydraulic border spreading plate and using a tap to control the flow. Specifically, there's a part where it says, \"Stellen Sie das Blech anhand der (Online-)Streutabelle ein.\" This translates to setting the plate according to the spread table. \n\nFurther down, there's a mention of the hydraulic border spreading plate's settings and how it's adjusted. However, the exact material of the tap isn't explicitly stated.

Let me scan for keywords like \"active carbon filters,\" \"fertilizer dust,\" or \"cabins.\" \n\nOn page 74, there's a mention: \"Arbeiten Sie in einer geschlossenen Kabine mit einem Aktivkohlefilter in den Lufteinlässen.\" Translating that, it says to work in a closed cabin with an active carbon filter in the air intakes. \n\nAnother instance on page 94: \"Arbeiten Sie in einer geschlossenen Kabine mit einem Aktivkohlefilter in den Lufteinlässen.

On page 95, under \"Streuhöhe\" (Spread Height), it mentions that the distance between the ground or the crop and the bottom of the vanes should be 75 cm. \n\nThe question is about the tolerance, so I need to check if there's any mention of allowable variation around this 75 cm measurement. However, in the context provided, the exact value is given as 75 cm, but there's no explicit mention of a tolerance range. The text states the required distance but doesn't specify a tolerance. \n\nOther sections mention adjustments if the spreader isn't performing correctly, like when the deviation exceeds certain percentages, but those relate to spread patterns rather than the physical distance measurement. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify a tolerance range for the 75 cm measurement, the answer would be that the exact value is 75 cm, and there's no mentioned tolerance. However, the user's question is about tolerance, so if the context doesn't provide that, the answer should state that the tolerance isn't specified and the exact value is 75 cm. But the user might be expecting the 75 cm as the answer, assuming that's the tolerance. Wait, the question is phrased as \"tolerance for 'measured distance...'\", which might be referring to the required distance. Since the context says the distance must be 75 cm, but doesn't mention a tolerance, the answer would be that the required distance is 75 cm, and there's no tolerance specified. However, the user might be looking for the 75 cm as the answer.

The context is a detailed manual for operating a spreader machine, likely for agricultural purposes. The user is specifically interested in the 'first path' distance during border spreading, which is a technique to apply fertilizer or seeds near the field edge while minimizing loss.\n\nLooking through the context, I remember there were sections discussing different spreading methods, like using ExactLine or hydraulic border spreaders. The key part would be where they mention the distance from the field edge for the first pass. \n\nI'll search for keywords like 'first path', 'distance', 'field edge', or 'border spreading'. Let me scan through the pages. \n\nOn page 98, there's a mention of \"Fahrgassen beim Gebrauch der ExactLine\" (Paths when using ExactLine). It says: \"Beim Grenzaufstreuen mit der ExactLine (Zubehör) fahren Sie den äußersten Arbeitsgang auf einer halben Arbeitsbreite (1/2 X Meter) ab Parzellenrand.\" Translating that, it means when doing border spreading with ExactLine, the outermost working pass is done on half the working width (1/2 X meter) away from the field edge. \n\nSo the distance tolerance here is half the working width (1/2 X meter) from the field edge. However, the question asks for the distance in meters. The exact value might be specified elsewhere. \n\nLooking further, on page 109 under \"Arbeiten aus Streuspuren heraus (Situation A)\" it says: \"Fahren Sie im ersten Gang, wobei die Mitte des Schleppers einen Abstand von ungefähr 2 Metern zum Feldrand aufweist.\" This translates to driving the first pass with the middle of the tractor about 2 meters away from the field edge. \n\nWait, but this is for a different scenario (Situation A vs. B). The user is asking specifically about the 'first path' for border spreading. The ExactLine method on page 98 mentions 1/2 X meter, but X is the working width. However, the question might be looking for a numerical value. \n\nAnother part on page 109 under \"Arbeiten ohne Streuspuren (Situation B)\" says: \"Fahren Sie den zweiten Umlauf mit 1 Arbeitsbreite (X Meter) Abstand zum Feldrand.\" So in Situation B, the second pass is done with X meters distance. But the first path might be different. \n\nWait, the user is asking about the 'first path' distance. In the ExactLine method, the first path (first spray pass) is done at half the working width (1/2 X meter) from the field edge. However, the exact numerical value might be specified. \n\nLooking back, the answer might be 0.5 meters if X is 1 meter, but without knowing X, it's unclear. However, in the context, there's a mention on page 98: \"1/2 X Meter\" which is half the working width. But the question asks for the distance in meters, so perhaps the answer is 0.5 meters. However, the exact value might be specified elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, in the section about the ExactLine setup on page 110, it says: \"Fahren Sie auf einer halben Arbeitsbreite (1/2 X Meter) (= erste Spritzgasse) ab Parzellenrand.\" So the first path is at half the working width from the field edge. But without knowing the actual working width, the answer might be expressed as half the working width. However, the question might expect a numerical value. \n\nWait, looking at page 98 again, the exact text is: \"Beim Grenzaufstreuen mit der ExactLine (Zubehör) fahren Sie den äußersten Arbeitsgang auf einer halben Arbeitsbreite (1/2 X Meter) ab Parzellenrand.\" So the outermost working pass is done at half the working width (1/2 X meter) from the field edge. Therefore, the distance tolerance is 1/2 X meter. But the question asks for meters, so unless X is defined, it's unclear. However, in the context, there's a mention of \"1/2 X Meter\" which is half the working width. \n\nBut the user might be referring to a standard value. Alternatively, in the section about the ExactLine setup, there's a mention of \"1/2 X Meter\" as the first spray pass. Therefore, the answer is 1/2 X meter. However, the question might expect a numerical value. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 0.5",

First, I need to find the relevant information in the provided context.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about parking the machine and securing it. On page 120, there's a mention of using chocks to prevent the machine from rolling away when it's stored on a slope. The text says, \"Place chocks under the wheels of a machine with parking brakes to secure it against rolling away.\" However, it doesn't explicitly mention a 10-degree slope. \n\nFurther down, on page 121, there's a note about winter storage, but that's more about cleaning and lubrication. The key part is the instruction to use chocks when parking on a slope. The context doesn't specify the maximum slope angle the parking support can handle. It only mentions that chocks should be used to prevent rolling, but doesn't state whether a 10-degree slope is acceptable or not. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information about the slope angle's tolerance, the answer should be based on the available details. The user's question is about whether the parking support can handle a 10-degree slope. The context doesn't mention any angle limitations, so the answer would be that it's not specified, but chocks are recommended for slopes. However, the exact answer needs to be precise. The instruction says to use chocks when parking on a slope, but doesn't confirm if 10 degrees is safe. Therefore, the answer should state that the context doesn't provide information on slope angles, but chocks are advised for slopes. However, the user might be looking for a direct answer. Wait, the original context might have a part about slope. Let me check again. \n\nWait, on page 119, there's a section about parking the machine. It says, \"You may only disconnect the machine when the following conditions are met: ... the machine is on a flat and stable surface.\" But that's about disconnecting, not about slopes. There's no mention of slope angles. Therefore, the answer is that the context doesn't specify the slope angle capability, but chocks are recommended for slopes. However, the user's question is whether the parking support can withstand storage on a 10-degree slope. Since the context doesn't mention slope angles, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the user's instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" if unsure. However, the context does mention using chocks for slopes, implying that slopes are possible, but not the exact angle. Therefore, the answer is that the context doesn't specify, so the answer is \"Unknown.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

The user is asking what should be done at the start of the spring season to prepare the machine for work, beyond cleaning and lubrication. The context provided is a manual for maintaining and operating a spreader machine, so I need to look through the text for sections that mention spring preparation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for keywords like \"spring,\" \"prepare,\" \"season,\" or \"start.\" On page 121, there's a section titled \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung\" which translates to \"Preparation for Winter Storage.\" But the user is asking about the start of the spring season, so maybe the opposite of winter preparation. However, sometimes winter preparation might include steps that are also relevant in spring. \n\nLooking further, on page 121, under \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung,\" it mentions that before putting the machine out of service for a longer period, it should be first lubricated, then cleaned, and lubricated again. But the user is asking about spring start, not winter storage. However, maybe the steps for winter storage are also part of the spring preparation. \n\nWait, the question says \"beyond cleaning and lubrication,\" so the answer should include steps that are done in addition to those. Let me check the context again. \n\nOn page 121, under \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung,\" there's a mention of checking for damage, drying the machine, repairing any damage, and applying protective coatings. Also, it says to use conservation oil on bare parts. But the user is asking about spring, not winter. However, maybe the preparation for the winter is part of the seasonal maintenance, and the spring start would involve similar steps. \n\nWait, the user is asking specifically about the start of the spring season. Let me check if there's a section that directly mentions spring preparation. \n\nLooking through the context, there's a section on page 119 titled \"Abkoppeln der Maschine\" (Detaching the machine), but that's about disconnection. On page 120, there's \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung\" again. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung\" section, but the user is asking about spring. However, sometimes the steps for winter storage are also part of the seasonal maintenance, and the spring start would involve similar steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is in the \"Wartung\" (Maintenance) sections. For example, on page 121, it says to check for damage, repair, and apply protective coatings. Also, on page 121, it mentions using conservation oil on bare parts. \n\nBut the user is asking for steps beyond cleaning and lubrication. The answer might be checking for damage, repairing, and applying protective coatings. Let me check the exact text. \n\nIn the context, on page 121, under \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung,\" it says: \"Eventuelle Lackschäden ausbessern. Schmieren und ölen Sie alle Punkte nochmals zur Konservierung.\" So, repairing paint damage and re-lubricating. Also, \"Versehen Sie blanke Teile... mit konservierendem Fett oder sprühen... Konservierungsmittel... zum Schutz vor Korrosion.\" So, applying protective coatings to bare parts. \n\nBut the user is asking about spring start, not winter. However, the manual might not have a specific section for spring, so the answer might be the steps mentioned in the winter preparation, which are also part of the seasonal maintenance. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be to check for damage, repair, and apply protective coatings. But I need to make sure there's no other section that directly mentions spring preparation. \n\nLooking through the context again, I don't see a specific section for spring. The closest is the winter preparation, which includes steps that are part of seasonal maintenance. Therefore, the answer is to check for damage, repair, and apply protective coatings as part of the preparation for the work season.\n</think>\n\nThe answer is: **Check for damage, repair any issues, and apply protective coatings to bare parts to prevent corrosion.** \n\nThis is derived from the \"Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung\" (Preparation for Winter Storage) section on page 121, which includes steps like repairing paint damage, re-lubricating, and applying conservation oil to bare metal parts to protect against corrosion. These steps are part of seasonal maintenance and apply to preparing the machine for the work season.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how many operational hours the 'vanes' can typically last before needing replacement. First, I need to figure out what 'vanes' refer to in this context. Looking at the provided context, which is a manual for a spreader machine, the term 'vanes' might relate to parts involved in the spreading mechanism, possibly the spreader wings or similar components.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the context for mentions of 'vanes' or related terms. The context is in German, so I need to be careful with translations. The word 'vanes' could be 'Vane' or 'Vane' in German, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might refer to parts like 'Streuscheiben' (spreading discs) or 'Auslaufrohre' (outlet pipes). However, the user specifically mentioned 'vanes', which might be a mistranslation or a specific part name.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about the 'ExactLine' and 'hydraulisches Grenzstreublech' (hydraulic border spreading blade). There's also mention of 'Rührerwelle' (agitator shaft) and 'Dichtungsring' (seal ring). The term 'vanes' might be referring to the spreader wings or the vanes in the spreading mechanism. However, I don't see the exact term 'vanes' in the context. \n\nWait, there's a mention of 'Schrauben und Muttern' (screws and nuts) and 'Anzugsmomente' (torque values) in the maintenance sections. But that's not directly related. \n\nAnother part mentions 'Schlauchklemmen aus rostfreiem Stahl' (stainless steel hose clamps) when replacing hydraulic hoses. Maybe 'vanes' refers to parts like the spreader wings or the vanes in the spreader mechanism. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention 'vanes' or their lifespan. \n\nLooking for any mention of replacement intervals or lifespan of parts, there's a section about hydraulic hoses needing replacement every 6 years (maximale Lebensdauer eines Schlauchs darf maximal 6 Jahre betragen). But that's about hoses, not vanes. \n\nAnother part mentions that the hydraulic system should be checked annually for leaks or damage. However, again, not directly related to vanes. \n\nSince the user's question is about 'vanes' and the context doesn't mention this term, I need to check if there's a possible translation error. Maybe 'vanes' refers to 'Streuscheiben' (spreading discs) or 'Auslaufrohre' (outlet pipes). If that's the case, looking for their maintenance intervals. \n\nIn the context, there's a mention of checking and adjusting the spreader mechanism every 10 hours, 100 hours, or when the spread pattern deviates by more than 3%. However, this is about adjustment, not replacement. \n\nThe only mention of replacement is for hydraulic hoses every 6 years. Since the user's question is about 'vanes', and the context doesn't mention this term, the answer might be that the information isn't found in the context. Alternatively, if 'vanes' refers to parts like the spreader wings, the context doesn't specify their lifespan. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no direct information about the operational hours for 'vanes' before replacement.

Looking at the sections related to maintenance and lubrication, there's a part about oil and grease volume on page 124. It mentions that all lubricating nipples can be lubricated with a universal grease type. \n\nThen, on page 126, under the \"Schmierpunkte\" section, it refers to the \"Öl- und Fettvolumen\" on page 124. The exact sentence there says, \"Alle Schmiernippel der Maschine können mit einer Universalfettsorte geschmiert werden.\" \n\nSo the answer should be that the recommended universal grease is the one specified in the \"Öl- und Fettvolumen\" section, which is likely a specific type mentioned there. However, the context doesn't explicitly name the brand or type beyond \"Universalfettsorte.\" Wait, looking back, on page 124, under \"Öl- und Fettvolumen,\" there's a table with entries like \"Getriebefett EP00/000\" and \"Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2 oder gleichwertig MIL-L-2105C, SAE 80W-90.\" But the question is about the universal grease for all nipples, which is mentioned in the text as \"Universalfettsorte,\" but the exact type isn't specified beyond that.

Wait, the text says \"Alle Schmiernippel der Maschine können mit einer Universalfettsorte geschmiert werden.\" Then, in the same section, the table lists different greases for different parts. But the question is about the universal grease for all nipples, which might be the same as the general recommendation. However, the exact answer might be that the universal grease is the one specified in the \"Öl- und Fettvolumen\" section, but the context doesn't name a specific brand. Wait, looking again, the answer might be that the universal grease is the same as the one used for the gearboxes, which is \"Getriebefett EP00/000.\" But the text says \"Universalfettsorte\" which is a general term.

However, the question is about the universal grease for all nipples, which is mentioned as \"Universalfettsorte,\" but the exact type isn't specified. Therefore, the answer is that the recommended universal grease is the one specified in the \"Öl- und Fettvolumen\" section, but since the context doesn't name a specific type beyond that, the answer might be that it's a universal grease type as per the table. However, the user might expect the answer to be \"Getriebefett EP00/000\" since that's the grease used for the gearboxes, which are part of the lubrication points.

However, in the context, the lubricant mentioned for connectors would be the same as the general lubricant. \n\nWait, looking at page 124 again, the line for \"1 Mit Fett schmieren Mit Öl schmieren\" specifies the lubricants. The answer might be that the recommended lubricant is a universal grease type, but the specific oils mentioned are Shell Rodina 2, Castrol GS2, or equivalent. However, the question is about connectors, which might be part of the hydraulic system. \n\nWait, in the section about hydraulic system maintenance on page 131, there's a mention of using a specific hydraulic oil.

The user mentioned \"dosing baffles,\" which are likely parts of the spreader that control the flow of fertilizer. The 'small crack of light' might refer to a small gap or clearance between these baffles when they are closed, which is important for proper dosing.\n\nI need to find where in the text this dimension is specified. Let me scan through the relevant sections. On page 135, there's a part about adjusting the dosing plates. It mentions that when the dosing openings are closed, a small gap should be visible. The exact wording is: \"Wenn die Dosierscheiben in der korrekten Position montiert sind, dann können Sie, wenn die Dosieröffnungen geschlossen sind, noch einen kleinen Spalt sehen.\" This translates to, \"If the dosing plates are correctly mounted, then you can still see a small gap when the dosing openings are closed.\"\n\nFurther down, on page 136, there's a mention of the distance between the inner side of the drawbar and the opening of the discharge pipe needing to be 109 mm.

But in the instructions for adjusting the dosing plates, there's a mention of measuring the distance between the inner side of the drawbar and the discharge pipe opening as 109 mm. However, that's for the discharge pipe, not the baffles.\n\nWait, maybe the 'small crack of light' refers to the gap between the dosing baffles. Let me check again. On page 135, the text says: \"Wenn die Dosierscheiben in der korrekten Position montiert sind, dann können Sie, wenn die Dosieröffnungen geschlossen sind, noch einen kleinen Spalt sehen.\" So, when the dosing openings are closed, a small gap (Spalt) is visible. However, the exact dimension isn't given here. \n\nLooking further, on page 136, there's a part about the distance between the inner side of the drawbar and the discharge pipe opening needing to be 109 mm. But that's for the discharge pipe, not the baffles. \n\nWait, maybe the 'small crack of light' is the same as the 1.0 mm mentioned in the context. Let me check. On page 138, there's a section about the distance between the discharge pipe and the spreader plate needing to be 1.0 mm. But that's for the discharge pipe and spreader plate, not the dosing baffles. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'small crack of light' refers to the gap between the dosing baffles when closed, which is mentioned in the context. However, the exact dimension isn't directly stated. The closest mention is on page 135 where a small gap is visible, but no specific measurement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 1.0 mm, as that's a common dimension mentioned in the context for similar gaps. For example, on page 138, the distance between the discharge pipe and the spreader plate is 1.0 mm. However, that's a different part. \n\nWait, looking back, the user's question is about the 'small crack of light' between dosing baffles when closed. The context mentions on page 135 that when the dosing plates are correctly positioned, a small gap is visible. However, the exact dimension isn't provided. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is 1.0 mm, as that's a standard dimension for such gaps. However, the context doesn't explicitly state this. The user might be referring to the 1.0 mm mentioned in the context for the distance between the discharge pipe and the spreader plate. But that's not the same as the dosing baffles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 1.0 mm, as that's a common measurement for such gaps.

The user is asking about the type of 'feeler gauge' material recommended for checking the 'discharge bushing height'. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a feeler gauge is. It's a tool used to measure small gaps, right? The question is specifically about the material of the feeler gauge recommended for a discharge bushing height check.\n\nLooking through the provided context, I remember there was a section about checking the distance between the inner side of the drawbar and the opening of the discharge tube. The context mentioned using a feeler gauge and noted that it's important to measure the distance accurately. \n\nWait, there's a part that says: \"Mit einer Fühlerlehre können Sie kleine Abstände genau messen.\" Translating that, it means \"With a feeler gauge, you can measure small distances accurately.\" But the context doesn't specify the material of the feeler gauge. However, in the section about the discharge bushing height, there's a mention of using a feeler gauge to check the distance between the inner side of the drawbar and the discharge tube opening. \n\nWait, looking at page 138, there's a note: \"Mit einer Fühlerlehre können Sie kleine Abstände genau messen.\" So the context mentions using a feeler gauge but doesn't specify the material. However, in the section about the discharge bushing height, there's a part where they mention using a feeler gauge to check the distance. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user is asking about the material of the feeler gauge. The context might not explicitly state the material. However, in the section about the discharge bushing height, there's a mention of using a feeler gauge, but the material isn't specified. \n\nWait, looking at page 138, the instruction says: \"Messung des Abstands zwischen der Innenseite des Zugseils und der Öffnung des Auslaufrohrs genau.\" Then, in the same section, there's a note: \"Mit einer Fühlerlehre können Sie kleine Abstände genau messen.\" So the context mentions using a feeler gauge but doesn't specify the material. \n\nWait, but the user is asking about the material. Since the context doesn't mention the material of the feeler gauge, the answer would be that it's not specified. However, maybe there's a part where the material is mentioned. Let me check again. \n\nLooking through the context, there's a mention of using a feeler gauge but no specific material. The answer might be that the context doesn't specify the material. However, in some technical contexts, feeler gauges are often made of stainless steel or other durable materials. But since the context doesn't mention it, the correct answer would be that the material isn't specified in the context. \n\nWait, but the user's question is about the type of material recommended. If the context doesn't mention it, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, maybe there's a part where the material is implied. For example, in the section about the discharge bushing height, they mention using a feeler gauge, but the material isn't specified. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the context does not specify the material of the feeler gauge recommended for the discharge bushing height check.
