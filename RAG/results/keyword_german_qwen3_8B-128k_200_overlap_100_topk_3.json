The spreader's control system might be involved in measuring the fertilizer quantity. \n\nBut the question is about which system continuously measures. The context mentions the external system and the control system of the spreader. However, the exact answer might be the \"Steuersystem des Streuers\" (spreaders' control system) since it's part of the communication setup. But I need to check if there's a direct mention of measuring fertilizer quantity. \n\nWait, the question is about measuring, but the context doesn't explicitly state which system does that. The context talks about communication between systems but not about measurement. The user might be referring to the external system or the control system. However, the answer isn't directly stated. The closest is the spreader's control system being part of the communication.

The user is asking how the tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information. The context mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz (power supply cable set) can be used to add it. Once added, the tractor becomes ISOBUS-ready, allowing the machine to be connected to the IsoMatch control panel.\n\nNow, the specific part about the driving speed: the context states that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to the IsoMatch. But the question is about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. Wait, the initial setup says that if the tractor lacks ISOBUS, the Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to add it. So once the ISOBUS is added through the cable set, the speed would then be transmitted via ISOBUS. However, the question is about the method of transmission when the tractor initially lacks ISOBUS. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that the Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to enable ISOBUS, which then allows the speed to be transmitted. But the exact answer might be that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after adding the cable set. However, the question is phrased as \"if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication,\" so the answer would involve using the Stromversorgungskabelsatz to add ISOBUS, which then allows the speed to be transmitted through ISOBUS. But the context says that the speed is transmitted over ISOBUS, so the answer would be that the Stromversorgungskabelsatz enables ISOBUS, allowing the speed to be transmitted via ISOBUS. But the question is specifically about how the speed is transmitted when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. The answer might be that the Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to add ISOB, and then the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS. However, the exact answer in the context is that the speed is transmitted over ISOBUS after adding the cable set. So the answer is that the Stromversorgungskabelsatz enables ISOBUS, allowing the speed to be transmitted via ISOBUS. But the question is how the speed is transmitted when the tractor lacks ISOBUS.

But the question is about the method of transmission, so the answer is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after the Stromversorgungskabelsatz is installed.

Looking at the text, under the \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen\" section, there's a table with entries like \"0\" and \"1\" with kg/min values. \n\nIn the first row (0), the kg/min is 18+0, and the note says \"m\u00fcssen Sie das Feindosier-Set verwenden\" which translates to \"You must use the Feindosier-Set.\" The question is about the application rate below which the fine application is advised.

The question is about the rate below which the fine application is advised. If the Feindosier-Set is used for lower rates, maybe the threshold is 18 kg/min. But the answer needs to be precise. The context mentions \"m\u00fcssen Sie das Feindosier-Set verwenden\" which is required when using the specified settings. The exact rate might be 18 kg/min. However, the answer should be based on the exact data. The first row's kg/min is 18+0, which is 18 kg/min. The note says that the setting is based on using the Feindosier-Set, so perhaps the advice is to use it below 18 kg/min. But the question is phrased as \"below which application rate,\" so the answer might be 18 kg/min. Alternatively, looking at the second table under SlugPellets, there's a row with 6+0 kg/min, which is 6 kg/min. But that's for a different product. The main question is about the general application rate. The first table's first entry is 18 kg/min, and the note says to use the Feindosier-Set. So the answer is 18 kg/min. But I need to confirm. The question is asking for the rate below which the fine application is advised. If the Feindosier-Set is required for the settings in the first row (18 kg/min), then maybe the advice is to use it below that rate. However, the exact answer might be 18 kg/min. Alternatively, the answer could be 18 kg/min as the threshold. The context says \"m\u00fcssen Sie das Feindosier-Set verwenden\" which is required for the given settings, so the advice is to use it when the rate is 18 kg/min.

The context mentions \"Streubild\" which translates to spread pattern or spread image.

Each entry advises adjusting the outlet opening by two letters towards A or U and repeating the test. The tray test seems to be part of the process to check the spread pattern's width. \n\nThe question is about what the tray test checks. From the context, the test evaluates whether the spread is too narrow or too wide, which relates to the spreader's calibration. The answer should be precise, so I need to extract the exact information. The context doesn't mention the tray test's purpose directly, but the adjustments are made based on the spread pattern's width. Therefore, the tray test checks the spread pattern's width to ensure proper calibration.\n</think>\n\nThe tray test checks the spread pattern's width to determine if the fertilizer spreader is calibrated correctly.",

Maybe safety procedures are involved. However, the question specifically asks for actions in case of failure or stoppage. \n\nAnother entry is \"Wartung\" (21) and \"Wartung\" again at line 35. \"Wartung\" means maintenance.

The context provided has several entries with different scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to look for mentions of irregular spreading. The context mentions \"Gutes Streubild, der Streuer ist gut eingestellt\" which translates to a good spread pattern, the spreader is properly adjusted. Then there's entry 0 B: \"Der Streuer streut zu schmal\" meaning the spreader is spreading too narrow. The instruction is to adjust the outlet opening setting 2 letters towards A and repeat the test. \n\nEntry 1 C says the spreader is too wide, adjust 2 letters towards U. Entry 2 D mentions a trapezoidal spread pattern (which is irregular) and again adjust 2 letters towards A. Entry 3 E talks about spreading too wide with a trapezoidal pattern, adjust 2 letters towards U. \n\nThe question is about irregular spreading. The trapezoidal shape is mentioned in entries 2 D and 3 E. So, if the spread is irregular (trapezoidal), the instruction is to adjust the outlet opening 2 letters towards A or U depending on whether it's too narrow or wide. But the question is general about irregular, so maybe the answer is to adjust based on the specific direction. However, the exact answer needs to be precise. \n\nLooking at the context, the answer for irregular spreading (trapezoidal) is to adjust 2 letters towards A if it's too narrow, or towards U if too wide. But the question is about irregular, which could be either. However, the answer should be based on the exact text. The user might be referring to the trapezoidal shape as irregular. The answer in the context for trapezoidal is to adjust 2 letters towards A (for narrow) or U (for wide). But the question is general. Wait, the answer needs to be exact. The context says for trapezoidal (irregular) spreading, adjust 2 letters towards A or U depending on the direction. But the question is \"irregularly\" which could be either.

The answer in the context for irregular (trapezoidal) is to adjust 2 letters towards A or U. But the user's question is general. Wait, the answer should be the exact instruction from the context. The answer is: adjust the outlet opening setting 2 letters towards A or U depending on whether the spread is too narrow or too wide. But the question is about irregular, which could be either. However, the answer must be precise. The exact answer from the context is: if the spread is too narrow (trapezoidal), adjust 2 letters towards A. If too wide, adjust towards U. But the question is about irregular, which is covered by trapezoidal. So the answer is to adjust 2 letters towards A or U based on the direction. But the answer needs to be concise. The answer should be: Adjust the outlet opening setting 2 letters towards A if the spread is too narrow (trapezoidal) or towards U if too wide. But the user's question is \"irregularly\" which is covered by trapezoidal. However, the answer must be exact. The context says for trapezoidal (irregular) spreading, adjust 2 letters towards A (if too narrow) or U (if too wide). So the answer is to adjust 2 letters towards A or U depending on the direction. But the answer must be precise. The exact answer from the context is: \"Setzen Sie die Einstellung der Auslass\u00f6ffnung 2 Buchstaben Richtung A\" for too narrow, and \"Richtung U\" for too wide. Since the question is about irregular, which could be either, but the answer must be precise. The answer should be: Adjust the outlet opening setting 2 letters towards A or U depending on whether the spread is too narrow or too wide. But the answer must be concise.

Maybe the first number is when the window is closed, and the second when open? \n\nWait, looking at row 2: \"Schlepper bei 540 U/min (dB)\" with 71.9 and 76.2. The second value is under \"Heckfenster ge\u00f6ffnet\". So, for the tractor alone at 540 U/min, the sound level is 76.2 dB when the rear window is open. \n\nBut the question is about the tractor plus the spreading spreader (Kali 60) with the rear window open.

If the first number is closed and the second open, then the answer would be 84.6 dB. But I need to confirm if the second value corresponds to the rear window being open. \n\nIn row 2, the second value (76.2) is under \"Heckfenster ge\u00f6ffnet\". So, for the same configuration, the second number in each row is when the window is open. Therefore, row 4's second value (84.6) would be the sound level when the rear window is open for the tractor plus the spreading spreader (Kali 60). \n\nSo the answer should be 84.6 dB.\n</think>\n\n84.6",

The user is asking about the torque in Nm required to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information. The context has two main sections: one about the spreader settings and another about maintenance intervals. The maintenance part lists different bolt sizes (M5, M6, etc.) with numbers that might correspond to torque values. \n\nLooking at the maintenance table, under the M6 row, the numbers are 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 15, 15, 18.

The context doesn't specify friction values, but maybe the numbers correspond to different friction levels.

The user might be referring to the maintenance intervals for M6 bolts, and the answer is 15 Nm. But I need to check if the numbers are in Nm. The context doesn't specify units, but the question asks for Nm, so maybe the numbers are in Nm. The answer is likely 15 Nm for M6, but I need to confirm. Since the context doesn't mention A2 or friction, but the question includes those, maybe the answer is 15 Nm. However, the exact answer might be 15 Nm based on the M6 row's third value.

The user mentioned \"flow of the fertiliser is blocked,\" so I should look for any instructions related to troubleshooting or checking flow issues. The context has several numbered lines with instructions. Line 10 talks about taking i as half the machine length if unknown. Line 11 mentions a \"Zwischenbock (Zubeh\u00f6r)\" which translates to an intermediate bracket (accessory). There's also a mention of a manual Abdrehtest (manual rotation test) to check the discharge speed. \n\nThe question is about blocked flow, so the relevant part might be the manual test. The instruction says to perform a manual rotation test to control the discharge speed. The answer should mention checking the manual rotation test. The page reference might be line 10 or 11, but the user is asking for the page number. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention pages; it has line numbers. The user might be referring to the page in the document. Since the context includes line numbers, maybe the answer refers to line 10 or 11.

The user is asking, \"For what other kind of connections can the IM Tellus Input cable be used?\" So, I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of other connections besides the main ones discussed.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context. The main topic is about the IM Tellus Input cable and its various connections. The context mentions that the standard cable includes ISO 11786 'In Cab', lighting and ignition lock, Schlepper CAN (optional), and video input. \n\nWait, the question is about \"other kind of connections\" beyond the primary ones. The context says that if the tractor has a complete ISOBUS connection, the connection is via a 9-pin 'In Cab' cable between the tractor and the IsoMatch control panel. Then it mentions that other connections use the standard 'Input IM Tellus' cable set. \n\nSo the other connections here would be the ones that aren't the main ISO 11786 'In Cab' or the ISOBUS. The context lists \"Beleuchtung und Z\u00fcndschloss\" (lighting and ignition lock), \"Schlepper CAN\" (tractor CAN), and \"Videoeingang\" (video input) as part of the standard cable. \n\nThe question is asking for other connections besides the main ones. The answer should list these additional connections. The exact terms from the context are \"Beleuchtung und Z\u00fcndschloss\", \"Schlepper CAN\", and \"Videoeingang\". \n\nSo the answer should be these three.

The context provided is in German, so I need to parse through it carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for sections related to road transport. Scanning the context, there's a section labeled \"Transport\" with the number 21. Under that, it says \"Fahren Sie vorsichtig\" which translates to \"Drive carefully.\" Then there's a mention of checking the coupling ropes (Entkupplungsseile) to ensure they aren't taut and have enough movement, even when the crane is in the lowest position. Also, there's a note about the coupling ropes needing sufficient freedom of movement to prevent unintended uncoupling.\n\nWait, the question is about measures when stopping work, not during transport. But the context mentions \"Fahren Sie vorsichtig\" under Transport. Maybe that's part of the measures. Also, the section on \"Transport\" (21) might have relevant info. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the context, under \"Transport\" (number 21), the text says: \"Kontrollieren Sie die Entkupplungsseile der Schnellkupplung\" which is \"Check the coupling ropes of the quick coupling.\" Then it explains they must never be taut and must have enough movement even when the crane is in the lowest position to prevent unintended uncoupling. Also, \"Fahren Sie vorsichtig\" is mentioned, which is \"Drive carefully.\"\n\nBut the question is about measures when stopping work. The context might not explicitly mention stopping work, but the closest related info is under Transport. The answer should be the measures related to transport when stopping work. The key points are checking the coupling ropes and driving carefully. However, the exact answer might be \"Check the coupling ropes of the quick coupling to ensure they are not taut and have sufficient movement, even when the crane is in the lowest position, to prevent unintended uncoupling.

The exact text from the context is \"Kontrollieren Sie die Entkupplungsseile der Schnellkupplung\" and \"Fahren Sie vorsichtig.\" So combining these, the answer would be to check the coupling ropes and drive carefully. But the question is about measures when stopping work. The context might not have a direct mention of stopping work, but the Transport section's instructions are about measures during transport. However, the user might be referring to stopping work as part of transport procedures. Therefore, the answer should be the two points mentioned under Transport: checking the coupling ropes and driving carefully. But the exact answer needs to be extracted directly from the context. The answer should be \"Check the coupling ropes of the quick coupling to ensure they are not taut and have sufficient movement, even when the crane is in the lowest position, to prevent unintended uncoupling. Drive carefully.\" But the user wants it as precise as possible. Let me check the exact text again. The context says: \"Kontrollieren Sie die Entkupplungsseile der Schnellkupplung.

The rest of the text discusses things like the ExactLine's settings, speed sensors, and cables for ISOBUS communication. There's a mention of RS 232 in the context, but the specific baud rate isn't stated. \n\nSince the question is about the minimum baud rate for RS 232, and the context doesn't provide any numerical value or specification related to baud rates, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context. The user might be expecting a standard baud rate like 9600, but since the context doesn't mention it, the correct response is to state that it's not found.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The context provided is in German, so I need to parse through that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of fertilizer particle size or chunk size. The context starts with instructions about fertilizer granule size distribution. The first point says that if 10% or more of the granules are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to spread, leading to poor distribution and crop damage. Then there's a mention that if 80-100% of the granules are between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertilizer is easy to spread. Another point states that if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal for spreading but can cause crop damage due to holes in leaves.\n\nWait, the question is about preventing blockage. The context mentions that smaller granules (under 2.0 mm) can cause issues with spreading, but does it mention blockage? The first point says if 10% or more are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to spread. But the question is about maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. The context doesn't explicitly mention blockage. However, maybe the maximum size that's acceptable to avoid blockage would be the upper limit mentioned. The part about granules larger than 4.75 mm causing damage might relate to blockage, but the question is about preventing blockage. Alternatively, maybe the maximum size that's acceptable is 4.75 mm, as beyond that could cause issues. But the context says that if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal for spreading but causes crop damage. So perhaps the maximum acceptable size to prevent blockage is 4.75 mm. But the question is about chunk size, not particle size. Wait, the term 'chunk' might refer to larger pieces. The context mentions that if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal for spreading but causes damage. So maybe the maximum acceptable chunk size to prevent blockage is 4.75 mm. But the answer needs to be precise. The context doesn't directly mention blockage, but the question is about preventing it. The answer might be 4.75 mm as the upper limit. However, the first point says that if 10% are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to spread. But the question is about maximum chunk size. Maybe the answer is 4.75 mm. Alternatively, the maximum acceptable size to prevent blockage is 4.75 mm. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. The user might be referring to the maximum size that's acceptable to avoid blockage, which could be 4.75 mm. However, the context says that if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal for spreading but causes damage. So maybe the maximum acceptable size is 4.75 mm. But the question is about preventing blockage, which might be related to the size that's too large. Since the context doesn't mention blockage, but the answer is required, perhaps the answer is 4.75 mm. Alternatively, the answer might be 2.0 mm, but that's the lower limit. Wait, the question is about maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. If the chunks are too large, they might block the spreader. The context mentions that if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's optimal for spreading but causes damage. So maybe the maximum acceptable size is 4.75 mm. Therefore, the answer is 4.75 mm.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not mention a specific maximum chunk size to prevent blockage.
