I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the text for keywords like \"full field spreading\" or \"nappe d'épandage plein champ\" since the context is in French. The phrase \"nappe d'épandage plein champ\" appears a couple of times. \n\nLooking at the first sentence: \"La nappe d'épandage plein champ est recouverte à 100 %\". Translating that, it says the full field spreading pattern is covered at 100%. The word \"recouverte\" here likely refers to coverage, so the overlap might be related. But the question is about the overlap percentage. \n\nFurther down, there's another line: \"Pour la plupart des types d'engrais, vous pouvez prévoir pour la moitié de la largeur de travail une nappe d'épandage en triangle avec un recouvrement complet.\" This mentions a triangular spreading pattern with full overlap for half the working width. \"Recouvrement complet\" translates to full overlap, which would be 100% overlap. \n\nBut the question specifically asks about the \"full field spreading pattern\" (nappe d'épandage plein champ). The first mention says it's covered at 100%, but does that mean the overlap is 100%? The second part talks about triangular patterns with full overlap for half the width. Maybe the full field has 100% coverage but the overlap percentage is different. Wait, the term \"recouverte à 100%\" might mean coverage, not overlap. The overlap part is mentioned in the triangular part as \"recouvrement complet\" which is full, so 100% overlap. But the question is about the full field pattern. \n\nLooking again, the exact phrase \"nappe d'épandage plein champ est recouverte à 100 %\" is present. Since the user is asking for the overlap percentage, maybe \"recouverte\" here refers to overlap. Alternatively, maybe \"recouvrement complet\" in the triangular part is the key. But the question is about the full field, not the triangular. \n\nWait, the first sentence says the full field is covered at 100%, which might mean that there's 100% coverage, but the overlap percentage could be different. However, the question is about the overlap. The triangular pattern for half the width has full overlap. The full field might have a different value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"recouverte à 100%\" directly translates to 100% overlap. Since the user wants the exact percentage from the context, the first sentence states 100%, so the answer is 100%.\n</think>\n\nThe context states: \"La nappe d'épandage plein champ est recouverte à 100 %\". The overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is explicitly given as **100%**.  \n\n<answer>  \n100%  \n</answer>",

The context is in French, so I'll need to translate parts of it to understand. The key sections might be where they talk about the system measuring fertilizer. \n\nLooking at the paragraphs, there's mention of a \"système de commande\" (control system) several times. In the part about automatic calibration, it says: \"le système de commande pèse la quantité épandue (kg) d'engrais pendant une durée déterminée.\" This translates to \"the control system weighs the amount of fertilizer spread over a determined period.\" \n\nAnother part states that the control system corrects for speed changes and allows manual adjustment. Also, when the hopper content drops below 100 kg, the control system stops the automatic calibration because the measurement precision decreases. \n\nThe question is about continuous measurement. The phrase \"pendant une durée déterminée\" might mean during a set period, but the system is continuously doing this as part of its function. The context also mentions that if you refill the hopper during spreading, the system's measurements could be incorrect because it's weighing the spread amount continuously. \n\nThe key here is that the \"système de commande\" (control system) is the one doing the measuring. The answer should be in English, so translating that to \"control system\" makes sense. The context doesn't mention any other system like the sensor alone doing the continuous measurement; it's the control system that uses the sensor's signal. \n\nSo the answer should be \"the control system\" as it's the system mentioned responsible for continuously measuring the fertilizer quantity being spread.\n</think>\n\nThe system that continuously measures the fertilizer quantity being spread is the **control system** (système de commande). It weighs the amount of fertilizer spread over a determined period and adjusts accordingly. \n\n**Answer:**  \nThe control system.",

The question is about frequency, so I'm looking for words indicating time intervals or events that trigger the calibration.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a part that says: \"Lorsque le contenu de la trémie atteint une valeur inférieure à 100 kg, le système de commande coupe l'étalonnage automatique.\" This mentions when the system stops automatic calibration, but not the frequency.\n\nAnother section talks about the system seeking the right settings during spreading using automatic calibration. It says, \"L'inconvénient est que le débit peut s'écarter du débit souhaité jusqu'au deuxième étalonnage automatique (= environ 2 minutes).\" Here, it mentions that the second automatic calibration takes about 2 minutes. But this might refer to the time between calibrations rather than the frequency.\n\nWait, the key part might be: \"Le système de commande peut rechercher au cours de l'épandage à l'aide de l'étalonnage automatique le réglage adéquat...\" which says the system can perform automatic calibration during spreading. However, the question is about how often this happens. The text mentions that after the first automatic calibration, the second one takes about 2 minutes. But does that mean it recalibrates every 2 minutes? Or that it takes 2 minutes until the next calibration?\n\nAlternatively, the context might not explicitly state the frequency. The user instructions say to answer based strictly on the context. If the exact frequency isn't mentioned, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\".\n\nLooking again, the only mention related to timing is the \"environ 2 minutes\" for the second calibration. But that's the duration until the next calibration, not the interval between tests. The context doesn't specify how often the tests are carried out regularly. The other parts mention when to do manual tests (each year, after modifications), but the automatic calibration's frequency isn't clearly stated. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that it's not specified in the context, so \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\".\n</think>\n\nUnknown.

The user wants to know how a tractor's driving speed is transmitted to the IsoMatch when the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the context again to find relevant parts. The context mentions that if the tractor isn't ISOBUS, you can use the IsoMatch Power connector. There's a part that says if the speed isn't measured on the machine but through the tractor, then the speed sensor and adapter cable are connected to the IsoMatch box to get the speed signal from the tractor's electronics. \n\nThe key sentence here is: \"Si la vitesse n'est pas mesurée sur la machine (traînée), mais par l'intermédiaire du tracteur, le capteur de vitesse et le câble de l'adaptateur pour la récupération du signal de vitesse émis par l'électronique du tracteur sont raccordés au boîtier IsoMatch. Il faut un jeu de câbles spécial à cet effet.\"\n\nSo, the answer involves using an adapter cable and connecting the speed sensor to the IsoMatch via a special cable set. The IsoMatch Power connector is also mentioned for adapting non-ISOBUS tractors. The answer should mention connecting the speed sensor and adapter cable to the IsoMatch box using a special cable set. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is precise and in English. The exact steps are: connecting the speed sensor and adapter cable to the IsoMatch box to retrieve the speed signal from the tractor's electronics, requiring a special cable set. \n\nThe answer should be concise, so maybe: \"Using an adapter cable and speed sensor connected to the IsoMatch box to retrieve the tractor's speed signal, requiring a special cable set.\" \n\nWait, the context also mentions IsoMatch Power for non-ISOBUS tractors. The answer might need to include the IsoMatch Power connector. Let me check again. The part about IsoMatch Power says installing the IsoMatch Power connector makes the tractor ISOBUS compatible. But the specific transmission of speed uses the adapter cable and sensor connected to IsoMatch. \n\nSo the main steps are using the adapter cable and sensor connected to IsoMatch with a special cable. The IsoMatch Tellus uses the standard power cable for other connections, but the speed specifically uses the adapter and sensor. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is about connecting the speed sensor and adapter cable to the IsoMatch box via a special cable set to get the tractor's speed signal.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed is transmitted to the IsoMatch by connecting the speed sensor and adapter cable to the IsoMatch box to retrieve the speed signal emitted by the tractor's electronics, requiring a special cable set.",

The context is in French, so I'll need to translate and understand the key points. \n\nLooking at the first paragraph under \"Serrage des boulons et des écrous\", it says: \"Vérifiez régulièrement tous les boulons et écrous et resserrez-les au bout de la première heure d'utilisation, après · la livraison et · la réalisation des opérations de maintenance ou de réparation.\" \n\nBreaking this down: \"resserrez-les au bout de la première heure d'utilisation\" translates to \"tighten them after the first hour of use\".

The key phrase here is \"au bout de la première heure d'utilisation\" which directly translates to \"after the first hour of use\". So, the answer should be that they should be checked after the first hour of operation following setup or maintenance.\n\nI need to ensure there's no other part of the context that contradicts this. Scanning further, there's a table mentioning intervals like \"Tous les jours\", \"Tout es les 100 heures\", etc., but the specific mention after maintenance is in the first paragraph. The table's second row (number 1) mentions \"Contrôle des boulons et des écrous\" under the \"Au bout de les 10 premières heures\" column? Wait, the table's columns are a bit unclear due to formatting, but the first entry under the \"Tout es les semaines\" (every week) and others. However, the initial instruction clearly states after maintenance or delivery, it's after the first hour.

Then there's a section about bolts and nuts with threaded bases requiring an additional 10% of the tightening torque. It lists Tensilock (K100 and Whizlock. There's a note about exceptions in the manuals. \n\nLooking further, there's a table with columns for different qualities and friction coefficients. The headers mention \"Couples de serrage\" which translates to tightening torque. The rows have M5, 3.6, 5.7, etc., but I need to see if \"vane lock nuts\" are mentioned. \n\nThe question refers to \"vane lock nuts,\" and in the context, under maintenance instructions, there's a step: \"Retirez les pales.\" \"Pales\" means blades or vanes. The subsequent steps involve adjusting bolts and nuts on a gearbox housing. However, the specific torque values for these are in the table. \n\nThe table has entries like M5 with different friction coefficients (0.10, 0.20, 0.30) and different qualities (70 A2, 80 A4). For example, under 0.10 friction for 70 (A2), M5 is 3.6 NM. But the question is about the vane lock nuts. The context mentions \"écrous autobloquants\" (self-locking nuts) in the directives. The initial instruction says for self-locking nuts, add 10% to the torque. \n\nLooking at the table, if the vane lock nuts are considered self-locking (like Tensilock or Whizlock mentioned earlier), then the base torque from the table plus 10% would apply. However, the exact part (M5?) isn't specified in the question. The context's table lists M5 with values like 3.6, 5.7, etc., depending on the friction coefficient. \n\nWait, the user's question is about \"vane lock nuts.\" The step \"Retirez les pales\" (remove the blades/vanes) might be part of a procedure where the nuts in question are on the vanes. The next steps involve adjusting bolts on the gearbox housing. The torque values for M5 with 0.10 friction (which is for oiled surfaces) is 3.6 NM. But if it's a self-locking nut, add 10%, so 3.6 * 1.1 = 3.96, but the context might have a specific value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is directly in the table. The question is unclear on the exact part (M5?), but since the context's table includes M5 with 3.6 NM for 0.10 friction, and if the vane lock nuts are M5, then the base torque is 3.6 plus 10% gives 4.0 (rounded?), but the context might not explicitly state this. \n\nWait, the instruction says \"for bolts and nuts with threaded base, add 10% more torque, as well as for Tensilock (K100, Whizlock.\" So if the vane lock nuts are Tensilock or similar, then the base torque from the table plus 10% is needed. However, the exact value from the table for the specific bolt size (like M5) would be needed. \n\nBut the question doesn't specify the bolt size. The context's table includes M5 with 3.6 NM at 0.10 friction. If that's the relevant size, then adding 10% would be 3.96, but the answer might just take the base value from the table. However, the question might be referring to a different size. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is in the first part. The first sentence mentions coefficients of friction for different surfaces. The question is about torque, so the table's values are key. Since the user asks for the torque for vane lock nuts, and the context mentions that self-locking nuts require an additional 10%, but without the exact bolt size, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, looking again at the context, the steps mention \"Dévissez de 5 mm les écrous sur les boulons permettant le montage du boîtier de pignons sur le timon.\" This refers to nuts on bolts mounting the gearbox housing to the steering column. The torque values in the table for M5 at 0.10 friction is 3.6. If the vane lock nuts are M",

The exact steps here are the ones listed after the initial instruction. The most relevant precaution here is disconnecting the electronic control system, turning off the tractor's ignition, removing the key, and engaging the handbrake. \n\nBut the question is about the precaution to take before working between them. The context states that these steps are taken to prevent the tractor from starting and moving, which could cause injury. The exact answer should be the steps listed here.

I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of engaging the parking brake in that specific scenario.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for keywords like \"parking brake\" or \"frein à main\" (since the context is in French). The context mentions \"serrer le frein à main\" which translates to engaging the parking brake. \n\nLooking at the steps listed, there are a few instances where the parking brake is mentioned. The first section lists steps like débrancher le système de commande électronique, couper le contact, retirer la clé, and serrer le frein à main. The purpose here is to prevent the tractor from starting while working on it, avoiding movement and potential injuries.\n\nThen, in the section about moving on a public road, similar steps are repeated, including serrer le frein à main again. \n\nFurther down, under the part about \"La prise de force s'arrête après qu'elle ait été débrayée,\" there's a step that says \"Coupez le moteur du tracteur, retirez la clé du contact et serrez le frein à main sur le tracteur.\" This seems to be part of a procedure when moving the tractor a certain distance. \n\nThe question is specifically about before connecting the machine. The steps mentioned when preparing the tractor for moving (like on a public road or adjusting the machine) involve engaging the parking brake. However, the exact timing related to connecting the machine needs to be precise. \n\nLooking at the steps under \"La prise de force...\" which might relate to connecting or disconnecting the machine, the procedure includes engaging the parking brake after turning off the engine and removing the key. The steps here are part of a process where the tractor is moved slightly and then the brake is engaged. \n\nBut the question is about before connecting the machine. The context mentions that after moving the tractor, they engage the brake. However, the initial steps before starting work on the machine (like when preparing) also mention engaging the brake. \n\nWait, the first bullet points list \"serrer le frein à main\" as part of the steps to prevent the tractor from starting while working on it. So if connecting the machine is part of working on the machine, then yes, the parking brake should be engaged. \n\nBut the exact question is whether it should be engaged before connecting. The steps under \"La prise de force...\" which might be about disconnecting (or connecting?) mention engaging the brake after moving the tractor. However, the steps before moving on public roads also include engaging the brake. \n\nHmm, maybe the key part is in the first section where they list steps to prevent the tractor from moving while working on it. Since connecting the machine would be part of working on the machine, the answer would be yes, the parking brake should be engaged. \n\nLooking at the exact steps: \"serrer le frein à main sur le tracteur\" is listed as one of the steps to prevent the tractor from starting/moving. Therefore, before working on the machine (which includes connecting), the parking brake must be engaged. \n\nSo the answer is yes, and the exact context says to engage the parking brake as part of those safety steps before working on the machine, which includes connecting.\n</think>\n\nThe context states that the parking brake should be engaged (\"serrer le frein à main\") as part of the steps to prevent the tractor from starting or moving while working on the machine. This directly answers the question. \n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, the parking brake should be engaged before working on the machine (including connecting it), as specified in the steps to prevent unintended movement.  \n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about \"before connecting the machine.\" The context explicitly lists \"serrer le frein à main\" in the safety steps before working on the machine, which includes connection procedures.  \n\n**Final precise answer:**  \nYes.  \n\n(Exact context: \"serrer le frein à main sur le tracteur\" is listed as a required step to prevent the tractor from moving during work on the machine, which includes connection procedures.)  \n\n**Final formatted answer:**  \nYes.  \n\nWait, but the user requires the answer to be in English and strictly based on the context.

The context is in French, so I'll make sure I understand the key parts. The question is about the maximum angle, so I should look for mentions of angles related to the coupling shaft (arbre de transmission).\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sentences that mention angles. The first relevant part says: \"L'angle de travail maximal de l'arbre de transmission est de 30 vers le haut et de 30 ° vers le bas.\" Translating that, it's \"The maximum working angle of the coupling shaft is 30 upwards and 30° downwards.\" That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nFurther down, this same sentence is repeated again: \"L'angle de travail maximal de l'arbre de transmission est de 30 ° vers le haut et de 30 ° vers le bas.\" So it's emphasized twice, which reinforces that this is the correct information.\n\nThe question specifies \"both when lifted and lowered,\" which corresponds to \"vers le haut\" (upwards) and \"vers le bas\" (downwards) in the context. The value given is 30 degrees for both directions. \n\nI should check if there's any other angle mentioned that might be conflicting, but scanning through the rest, all references to the maximum angle are 30 degrees in both directions. There's also a mention of checking if the angle is under 30 degrees, which supports that 30 is the maximum allowed. \n\nNo other angles are discussed here, so the answer should be 30 degrees for both directions. The user wants the answer in degrees and in a precise format. Since the question asks for the maximum permissible angle when lifted and lowered, the answer is 30° for each direction. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is exact as per the context. The context uses \"30\" without specifying the degree symbol in the first mention but includes it later (\"30 °\"). So combining both, it's safe to present it as 30° for both directions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 30 degrees both when lifted and lowered.\n</think>\n\n[30° upwards and 30° downwards]",

The context provided is in French, so I need to parse that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context for mentions of cables (since \"decoupling ropes\" might be referred to as câbles here). The first bullet point says: \"Contrôlez les câbles de l'attelage rapide. Les câbles ne doivent jamais être tendus et doivent avoir une liberté de mouvement suffisante...\" which translates to \"Check the quick coupling cables. The cables must never be taut and must have sufficient freedom of movement...\" \n\nThe question is about what must be ensured with the decoupling ropes (cables) during connection. The key points here are that the cables shouldn't be tense and need enough movement even when the lifting device is in the lowest position. The reason given is to prevent accidental detachment of the quick couplings. \n\nThe answer should focus on the requirement for the cables: they must not be tense and must have sufficient freedom of movement. The rest of the steps in the context are procedures for connecting, but the specific requirement about the cables is in that first part. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include extra steps beyond what's asked. The question is specifically about the decoupling ropes (cables) during connection, so the exact answer from the context is the part about them not being taut and having enough movement. \n\nSo the precise answer should be: \"Les câbles ne doivent jamais être tendus et doivent avoir une liberté de mouvement suffisante\" but translated into English as per instructions. Wait, the answer needs to be in English. The user's instruction says to answer in English. So translating that: \"The cables must never be taut and must have sufficient freedom of movement.\"\n\nBut let me check again. The original context says \"même lorsque le dispositif de levage est dans la position la plus basse\" which adds \"even when the lifting device is in the lowest position.\" Should that be included? The question is about during power lift connection, so maybe that condition is part of the requirement. The exact answer must include that the cables must not be taut and have enough movement even in the lowest position. \n\nWait, the user's question is about what must be ensured during the connection. The context states that the cables must have enough movement even when the device is in the lowest position because otherwise, the quick couplings can come off accidentally. So the key points are the two conditions: not taut and sufficient movement, even at the lowest position. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer in English would be: \"The cables must never be taut and must have sufficient freedom of movement, even when the lifting device is in the lowest position.\" \n\nBut the user wants it extremely precise and concise. Let me check the exact wording again. The original says \"Les câbles ne doivent jamais être tendus et doivent avoir une liberté de mouvement suffisante, même lorsque le dispositif de levage est dans la position la plus basse...\" So the \"même...\" part is part of the requirement. \n\nTherefore, the answer must include that condition. So the answer in English should include that clause. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants just the main points without the reason. The question is about what must be ensured, so the answer is the two requirements: not taut and sufficient movement, even in the lowest position. \n\nYes, that's the exact information from the context. So the answer is as translated above.\n</think>\n\nThe cables must never be taut and must have sufficient freedom of movement, even when the lifting device is in the lowest position.",

The user wants the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context is in French, so I'll have to translate and understand the key parts. The question is about a formula, so I should look for any equations mentioned.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a formula written as:\nVitesse d'écoulement requise (kg/min) = (Largeur de travail (m) x vitesse d'avancement (km/h) x débit (kg/ha)) / 600\n\nThe French terms translate to:\n- Vitesse d'écoulement requise = required flowrate\n- Largeur de travail = working width (in meters)\n- Vitesse d'avancement = forward speed (in km/h)\n- Débit = application rate (in kg/ha)\n\nSo the formula is (working width * forward speed * application rate) divided by 600. \n\nThe example given uses 27m * 8 km/h * 25 kg/ha divided by 600, which results in 9 kg/min. That confirms the formula structure. \n\nThe question asks for the general formula, so I need to present it in terms of the variables without numbers. The answer should be in English, using the terms from the context translated appropriately. \n\nI should make sure not to include any extra steps or explanations, just the formula as presented. The key is to extract the exact formula from the context without adding anything else. \n\nChecking again, the context states the formula twice, so it's definitely the main point here. There's no mention of any other variables or steps in the formula. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (Width (m) × Speed (km/h) × Rate (kg/ha)) / 600.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is:  \n**Required flowrate (kg/min) = (Working width (m) × Forward speed (km/h) × Application rate (kg/ha)) / 600**  \n\nThis is directly extracted from the context's formula:  \n*\"Vitesse d'écoulement requise = (Largeur de travail (m) x vitesse d'avancement (km/h) x débit (kg/ha)) / 600\"*.",

The key part is \"supérieure à 1250 mm\" which means \"greater than 1250 mm\". The instruction states that when this distance exceeds 1250 mm, a platform is mandatory. \n\nThe question asks for the maximum distance before a platform is mandatory. So the threshold is 1250 mm. If it's more than that, you need a platform. Therefore, the maximum distance where a platform is not yet required would be up to and including 1250 mm. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the value that, when exceeded, requires the platform. So the exact number given in the context is 1250 mm. The answer should be 1250 mm because that's the threshold mentioned. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other part of the text that mentions another value.

Let me scan through the text again.\n\nLooking at the bullet points, there's a section that says: \"La distance maximale entre la machine et la plateforme ne peut excéder 200 mm.\" Translating that from French, \"distance maximale\" is maximum distance, \"machine\" refers to the spreader (since they're talking about the machine being moved towards the platform), and \"plateforme\" is the loading platform. So this sentence states that the maximum distance cannot exceed 200 mm. \n\nAnother part mentions a mobile platform: \"approchez la plateforme de chargement de l'épandeur jusqu'à ce que la distance entre les deux soit tout au plus de 200 mm.\" Here, \"tout au plus\" means \"at most,\" so again, 200 mm is the maximum allowed distance. \n\nBoth instances mention 200 mm, whether it's a fixed or mobile platform. The question doesn't specify which type, but since both cases use the same measurement, the answer should be 200 mm. \n\nI need to ensure there's no other number mentioned elsewhere. Scanning again, other numbers like 1250 mm, 10 cm, 75 cm, 4 meters, and 24 meters are present, but those relate to different aspects like the distance from the hopper edge, height, or positioning of bins. The key here is the distance between the spreader (machine/épandeur) and the loading platform (plateforme), which is consistently 200 mm in both scenarios. \n\nTherefore, the exact answer from the context is 200 mm. The user wants the answer in mm, and the context provides that directly. No ambiguity here, so \"Unknown\" isn't needed.\n</think>\n\n200",

First, I need to make sure I understand the context correctly.\n\nLooking at the context provided, it's about the procedures before spreading fertilizer, specifically when to perform a tray test. The question is about the materials needed for the test. The key sections here are under \"INDICATION\" and \"Réalisation\" (which translates to \"Implementation\" or \"Execution\"). \n\nThe user wants to know the materials required. Let me scan through the context again. The first part lists when to do the test: when using a fertilizer not in the manuals, online tables, or the mobile app; when the granulometry and density differ from specified values; or if the fertilizer quality is poor. \n\nThen under Réalisation, the steps mention things like turning off the tractor engine, removing the key, engaging the handbrake, separating the spreading discs by moving the hitch piece, and blocking it with a fixing bolt. There's also mention of a manual calibration test and needing a full hopper. \n\nWait, the question is about materials required. The steps mention \"bacs\" which translates to \"trays\" or \"bins\". The first part says \"Répartissez les bacs à égale distance les uns des autres sur la largeur de travail donnée.\" So distributing the trays equally across the working width. \n\nSo the materials needed would be the trays (bacs) themselves. Are there any other materials mentioned? The steps involve the tractor, spreading discs, the hitch piece, a fixing bolt. But those are part of the equipment, not materials for the test. The test requires the trays (bacs) to be placed. \n\nThe answer should be \"bacs\" but since the answer needs to be in English, \"trays\" is the translation. The context doesn't mention any other specific materials like measuring tools or specific types of fertilizer as materials required, just the trays. \n\nWait, the question is about materials required. The context says \"effectuer un test sur bacs\" which translates to \"perform a tray test\". The actual materials needed would be the trays themselves. The other steps involve the tractor and parts of the spreading equipment, but those are part of the machinery, not materials for the test. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is \"trays\" as the materials required. The context doesn't list any other materials like specific chemicals or tools beyond the trays. So the answer should be \"trays\".\n</think>\n\ntrays",

The user is asking for the maximum wind speed in meters per second (m/s) that's permissible for both the tray test and actual spreading. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context is in French, so I'll need to parse that. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections. The first part under section 8 mentions \"Travail dans de mauvaises conditions météorologiques : humidité de l'air élevée, pluie, chaleur ou vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\". Translating that, it says working in bad weather conditions like high humidity, rain, heat, or high wind speeds (>5 m/s). The recommendation here is to proceed with spreading only when conditions are favorable. So this part mentions that wind speeds higher than 5 m/s are considered unfavorable. \n\nThen, further down in the context, there's a bullet point that says \"N'utilisez pas l'épandeur lorsqu'il pleut ou que l'humidité atmosphérique est élevée.\" Which translates to not using the spreader when it's raining or humidity is high. The reason given is that the fertilizer would stick to the collection bins, leading to uneven spreading. However, this part doesn't mention wind speed again.\n\nThe question is specifically about the maximum permissible wind speed for both the tray test and actual spreading. The key here is to find if there's a specified maximum. The first part under section 8 mentions that wind speeds over 5 m/s are considered bad, so the implication is that the permissible speed is below that. Since the instruction says to proceed only when conditions are favorable, the maximum allowed would be 5 m/s or less. \n\nI need to check if there's any other mention of wind speed elsewhere in the context. Scanning through the rest, there's a part about testing the TrimFlow system and references to the tray test, but no additional wind speed numbers. The tray test instructions mention positioning tanks at a maximum distance and using additional tanks for wider spreads, but no wind speed there. \n\nThe key point is the \">5m/s\" in the first section. Since the context says to avoid high wind speeds over 5 m/s, the permissible maximum would be 5 m/s. The question asks for the maximum permissible, so the answer is 5 m/s. \n\nI should confirm if this applies to both the tray test and actual spreading. The context under section 8 talks about actual spreading conditions, and the tray test (test mentioned in the paragraphs about testing the system) would logically follow the same conditions. Since there's no separate mention of different wind speeds for the test, the same 5 m/s applies. \n\nTherefore, the exact answer from the context is 5 m/s.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n5\n</answer>",

That seems directly relevant. \n\nThe question specifically mentions \"one-sided boundary spreading\" which in the text is referred to as \"Épandage unilatéral en bordure\". The instruction right after mentions setting the distributor using the table data, desired working width, and the chapter on unilateral boundary spreading. The 75 cm height is mentioned in that same sentence, so that's the key point.\n\nI should check if there's any other mention of height elsewhere that might conflict. Later in the context, there's a part about adjusting the height after the test: \"réglez la hauteur des disques à 75 cm au-dessus du sol ou de la plante.\" But that's for before spreading, not the test with the troughs.

The exact phrases in French are: \"la coupure de la machine à cause de l'inertie de masse\" and \"rotation de la machine à cause de la force d'inertie\".\n\nThe key points here are that even after disengaging the PTO, the machine's moving parts might keep moving because of inertia. The danger is the machine (specifically rotating parts) continuing to move, which can cause serious injury. The reason is the inertie de masse or force d'inertie, which translates to inertia.\n\nSo the answer should state that the continued danger is the machine's rotation due to inertia. The context mentions this twice, so it's important. I need to make sure the answer is precise and uses the exact terms from the context if possible, but since the answer needs to be in English, I'll translate(inertia) but keep the structure accurate.\n\nChecking the instructions again: must be precise, concise, based strictly on context. The answer should mention the danger (machine rotation) and the reason (inertia). The exact phrases in the context are \"rotation de la machine à cause de la force d'inertie\" which translates to \"machine rotation due to inertial force\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is: The continued danger is the machine's rotation due to inertial force.\n</think>\n\nThe continued danger is the machine's rotation due to inertial force.",

But the main recommendation here is clearly 75 cm as the desired height. \n\nI don't see any other numbers mentioned in the context related to height. The question specifically asks for the recommended height from the last setting check, so the answer should be 75 cm. The other points talk about other settings like the combination of blades, openings, etc., but the height is explicitly stated as 75 cm. \n\nI should make sure there's no conflicting information.

I see a few sections. The first part says: \"Lorsque le contenu de la trémie atteint une valeur inférieure à 100 kg, le système de commande coupe l'étalonnage automatique.\" Translating that: \"When the hopper content reaches below 100 kg, the control system cuts off the automatic calibration.\" \n\nThen, further down, there's another identical sentence: \"Lorsque le contenu de la trémie atteint une valeur inférieure à 100 kg, le système de commande coupe l'étalonnage automatique.\" So it's repeated, which emphasizes its importance. \n\nThe next sentence after that in the context explains that the measurement precision decreases so much that a new automatic calibration can't establish a better flow curve. But the question specifically asks what happens when the content falls below 100 kg. The key action here is the system stopping the automatic calibration. The part about precision decreasing is an explanation of why the calibration is cut off, but the direct answer is the system cutting off the automatic calibration. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other condition or additional effect mentioned. The rest of the context talks about filling the hopper during spreading and other calibration issues, but those aren't directly related to the 100 kg threshold. \n\nSo the exact answer should be that the control system stops the automatic calibration. The user wants it precise and in English. Let me check the French again to confirm. \"Coupe l'étalonnage automatique\" translates directly to \"cuts off the automatic calibration\" or \"stops the automatic calibration.\" \n\nYes, that's the exact information.

The user is asking for the two actions that must be done if there's a spreader failure or stoppage while using it in the field. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context is in French, so I'll have to read through it carefully. The key part here is the section titled \"Utilisation dans les champs\" which translates to \"Use in the fields.\" Under that, there's a list of probable causes for malfunctions, which include blockages by hard objects or large fertilizer blocks, and also mentions damaged parts like blades, distribution disk, or flow rings.\n\nLooking further, the context gives instructions. The first bullet point says to introduce an object like a cloth or a bag into the flow ring's outlet on the damaged side to prevent fertilizer loss during road movement. The second instruction is to start the tractor, engage the control box, and the dosing units open. Wait, but that might be part of the procedure, not the actions to take when there's a stoppage.\n\nWait, the user is asking specifically about actions to take when there's a failure or stoppage. Let me check again. The context mentions under \"Utilisation dans les champs\" the possible causes, then the steps. The steps listed are:\n\n1. Introduisez délicatement un outil, par exemple un tournevis, dans l'ouverture d'écoulement pour voir si un objet n'y est pas coincé ou si les orifices de dosage ou l'agitateur ne sont pas endommagés. (Gently insert a tool like a screwdriver into the flow opening to check for blocked objects or damaged parts.)\n\n2. The next part repeats that if the blades, distribution disk, or flow rings are damaged, they must be repaired first before continuing. \n\nWait, but the question is about actions during the field use when there's a failure or stoppage. The first action mentioned is inserting a tool to check for blockages. The second action would be repairing the damage before continuing. However, the user is asking for two actions to be done in the event of failure. \n\nLooking again, the exact steps given are:\n\n- Introduisez un objet (cloth or bag) into the flow ring's outlet to prevent fertilizer loss during road movement. \n\n- Then, start the tractor and engage the control box, which opens the dosing units. \n\nWait, but those might be part of the procedure, not the actions when there's a stoppage. The part after the causes says:\n\n\"Introduisez délicatement un outil... pour voir si un objet n'y est pas coincé...\" which is checking for blockages with a tool. \n\nThen, if the parts are damaged, you must repair them first. \n\nSo the two actions would be:\n\n1. Insert a tool (like a screwdriver) into the flow opening to check for blocked objects or damaged parts.\n\n2. Repair the damage before continuing.\n\nBut the question is about what must be done in the event of failure or stoppage. The context says that when there's a stoppage, you should first check with the tool, and if parts are damaged, repair them. \n\nAlternatively, the first action mentioned in the context under the field use section is inserting an object (cloth/sack) into the flow ring's outlet to prevent loss during road movement. But that might be a preventive step. \n\nWait, the very first instruction in the context (before the field use section) says: \"Introduisez un objet, par exemple un morceau de tissu ou un sac, dans l'ouverture d'écoulement de la bague d'écoulement du côté endommagé. Vous éviterez ainsi de perdre de l'engrais au cours du déplacement sur route.\" So that's to prevent loss during road movement, which might be part of the steps when there's damage. \n\nBut the question is about during field use when there's a failure or stoppage. The two actions listed in the context under the field use section's instructions are:\n\n1. Insert a tool (e.g., screwdriver) into the flow opening to check for blockages or damage.\n\n2. If parts are damaged, repair them before continuing.\n\nTherefore, the two actions are:\n\n- Check with a tool for blockages or damage.\n\n- Repair the damage first.\n\nBut the user's question is about the two actions to take in the event of failure/stoppage. The context also mentions starting the tractor and engaging the control box, but that might be part of normal operation. \n\nAlternatively, the two actions are:\n\n1. Insert an object (cloth/sack) into the flow ring's outlet to prevent fertilizer loss during movement.\n\n2.

The first part talks about inserting a tool like a screwdriver into the flow opening to check for blocked objects or damaged dosage orifices or agitator. It mentions that if the blades, spreading disc, or flow rings are damaged, it's likely due to a hard foreign object and the agitator might also be damaged.

Next, another point suggests inserting a cloth or bag into the flow opening to prevent fertilizer loss during transport. \n\nFurther down, there's a section about starting the tractor and engaging the control box, where dosage units open. The key part here is when the spreading pattern of the left and right discs isn't the same and the difference is over 3%, the user can do certain steps or contact the dealer. The steps listed are checking if the machine is level horizontally in length and width, then performing control and adjustment of the dosage mechanism as described on page 133, and controlling and adjusting the drop point mechanism as on page 136, then repeating the test.\n\nThe question is about irregular spreading of the disc. The context mentions that if the spread pattern's shape between left and right discs differs by more than 3%, the user should perform those specific checks and adjustments. So the answer should reference those steps: checking the machine's horizontal alignment, doing the dosage mechanism check (page 133), and the drop point adjustment (page 136), and contacting the dealer if needed. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is precise and in English. The exact steps from the context are the three bullet points under the 3% difference condition. The answer should list those steps concisely.

Let me scan the text for mentions of these bagues.\n\nLooking at the steps provided: \n- \"Graissez les 2 graisseurs des deux bagues d'écoulement.\" This translates to \"Lubricate the 2 grease nipples of the two discharge bushings.\" So here it says each bague has 2 grease nipples? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The phrase \"les 2 graisseurs des deux bagues\" could mean that each of the two bagues has 2, but more likely it's 2 graisseurs total for both. Wait, let me check again. The sentence structure: \"les 2 graisseurs des deux bagues d'écoulement\" – so \"the 2 grease nipples of the two discharge bushings\". That would imply that together, the two bushings have 2 grease nipples. But maybe each has one? Hmm, maybe the wording is that each bague has two?

Wait, the original French says \"Les bagues d'écoulement sont montées sur paliers, fixées à l'arbre de l'agitateur et pourvues de 2 graisseurs.\" So \"The discharge bushings are mounted on bearings, fixed to the agitator shaft and equipped with 2 grease nipples.\" So the plural \"bagues\" (bushings) have 2 grease nipples in total? Or each? The wording is ambiguous. But the next instruction says \"Graissez les 2 graisseurs des deux bagues d'écoulement.\" So \"Lubricate the 2 grease nipples of the two discharge bushings.\" That would mean that two bushings have two grease nipples total. So each bague has one? Or maybe two per bague but two total? Wait, maybe there are two bushings, each with two grease nipples, making four? But the instruction says \"2 graisseurs\" for \"deux bagues\". Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check again. The first sentence says the bushings (plural) are equipped with 2 grease nipples. So regardless of how many bushings there are, each has 2? Or total? The instruction later says when you turn the distribution disk, until the two grease nipples appear. So maybe each bague has two, but when you turn, you see both of them. Alternatively, maybe each of the two bushings has one, totaling two. The key line is \"pourvues de 2 graisseurs\" which is \"equipped with 2 grease nipples\". Since the subject is plural (bagues), perhaps each has two? Or the total? The instruction says \"Graissez les 2 graisseurs des deux bagues\" which would be \"Lubricate the 2 grease nipples of the two bushings\". So two grease nipples in total for both bushings. Therefore, each bague has one? Or maybe two per bague but two total? Wait, maybe there are two bushings each with one grease nipple, totaling two. The initial description says \"pourvues de 2 graisseurs\" so the entire set of bushings (plural) have two grease nipples. So each bague has one, but there are two bushings, so two total. The question is asking per discharge bushing. Wait, the question is \"how many grease nipples do the discharge bushings have?\" So the total? Or per unit? The question is a bit ambiguous, but likely asking per bague. But the context says \"bagues d'écoulement\" (plural) have 2 graisseurs. So each bague has one? Or two? Let me re-express the French sentence: \"Les bagues d'écoulement sont montées sur paliers, fixées à l'arbre de l'agitateur et pourvues de 2 graisseurs.\" The \"pourvues de 2 graisseurs\" applies to the plural \"bagues\", so",

The context is in French, so I'll need to parse that. Let me read through the text again.\n\nThe first sentence says: \"De la graisse se trouve dans les boîtiers sous les disques d'épandage. Le niveau de graisse doit se trouver à 35 mm sous l'orifice de remplissage (vérifiez le niveau lorsque la machine est à l'arrêt depuis un certain temps).\" \n\nTranslating that: \"Grease is found in the boxes under the spreading discs. The grease level must be 35 mm below the filler opening (check the level when the machine has been stopped for some time).\" \n\nThat seems to directly answer the question. The key points here are \"35 mm sous l'orifice de remplissage\" which translates to 35 mm below the filler opening. The note about checking when the machine is stopped matches the question's condition of \"after the machine has stood still.\"\n\nLooking further down, there are other mentions of grease levels and procedures, but this first part specifically states the 35 mm requirement. There's also a part about the central compartment having two compartments with grease, but that mentions not having to change the grease, which doesn't affect the required level. \n\nNo other numbers are given for the grease level in the context. The other steps mention filling up to near the opening but don't change the specified 35mm measurement. \n\nSo the exact answer should be 35 mm. The question is specifically about the required level, so the answer is straightforward from that first sentence.\n</think>\n\n35",

The answer needs to be in meters, so I should convert 1.0 mm to meters. However, the user might expect the answer exactly as given, even if the unit is in millimeters. Let me check the question again. The user specifically says \"in m,\" so maybe they want the answer in meters. \n\nBut the context clearly states 1.0 mm. Since the question asks for meters, converting 1.0 mm would be 0.001 meters. However, the instruction says to base the answer strictly on the context.

The question might have a mistake, but I have to follow the context. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the comma in \"1,0 mm\" is a decimal point, so it's 1.0 mm. Since the question asks for meters, converting that would be 0.001 m. But the context doesn't mention meters. The instructions say to base the answer on the context. Since the context says 1.0 mm, maybe the answer should be 1.0 mm, even though the question says meters. But that would be conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the user intended millimeters but wrote meters. But I have to follow the context exactly. The question might have an error, but according to the given context, the answer is 1.0 mm. Since the user asked for meters, but the context only provides millimeters, maybe the correct answer is 0.001 m. However, the instructions say to extract the exact information. Since the context says 1.0 mm, maybe the answer should be written as 1.0 mm, even if the question's unit is different. But the user might expect the answer in meters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the comma in \"1,0 mm\" is a decimal separator, so it's 1.0 mm. The answer in meters would be 0.001. But the context doesn't specify meters. The user might have made a mistake in the unit, but I have to follow the context. \n\nThe strictest interpretation is to take the exact value from the context. The required distance is 1.0 mm. Since the question asks for meters, but the context only mentions millimeters, perhaps the answer is 0.001 m.

First, I need to make sure I understand what \"pattern\" refers to here. Looking at the context, there's a table that lists different types of fertilizers (engrais) with columns for Type, Treatment, Forme (shape), and Surface.\n\nThe question is about the 'Mineral' type. Let me scan through the context to find the entry for 'Minéral' (which is the French word for Mineral). In the table, row 2 is labeled \"Minéral\". The Forme column for that row says \"sphéricité irrégulière\" which translates to \"irregular sphericity\". The Surface column states \"très inégale\" meaning \"very uneven\".\n\nThe user wants the pattern, which in this context likely refers to the characteristics listed under Forme and Surface. Since the question asks for the pattern of 'mineral', the exact information from the table should be the answer. I need to make sure there's no other entry for Mineral elsewhere. Checking the rest of the context, there's another entry for \"Engrais prillé\" and others, but Mineral is only in row 2. \n\nSo the answer should combine the Forme and Surface descriptions for Minéral. The exact phrases from the context are \"sphéricité irrégulière\" and \"très inégale\". Since the instructions require an exact answer in English, but the context is in French, I should present the French terms as they are, since translating might alter the exactness. However, the answer format might need to be in English. Wait, the instructions say to answer in English. Hmm, but the question is about the pattern as per the context. The context uses French terms. The user might expect the answer in French since that's how it's presented. Let me check the instructions again. The answer should be in English, but the context is in French. However, the question is about the exact information from the context. Since the terms are in French, maybe they should be quoted. Alternatively, translate them but the user might prefer the exact terms. The instructions say to base strictly on the context. The answer should be precise, so perhaps just the French phrases. Wait, the answer needs to be in English. The user might want the translation. Let me think again. The question is in English but the context is in French. The answer should be in English. So translating \"sphéricité irrégulière\" to \"irregular sphericity\" and \"très inégale\" to \"very uneven\". But the answer format requires the exact information from the context. Since the context uses French terms, maybe the answer should present them as is. But the instructions say to answer in English. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. Let me check the example given in the context. The user might expect the answer in the original language from the context. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should be in English but using the terms as described. Since the question is about the pattern (shape and surface), the answer should list both. The exact answer from the context for Minéral is Forme: sphéricité irrégulière and Surface: très inégale. So combining those, the answer would be \"sphéricité irrégulière, très inégale\" but in English. Wait, but the user wants the answer in English. So translating them: \"irregular sphericity, very uneven\". But I need to confirm if that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be in French since that's the context's language. The instructions say to answer in English, so translating is necessary. Therefore, the precise answer in English would be \"irregular sphericity\" for shape and \"very uneven\" for surface. Since the question asks for the pattern, which includes both form and surface, the answer should include both. So the final answer is \"sphéricité irrégulière, très inégale\" but translated? Or keep the French terms? The user might prefer the exact terms from the context. Let me check the instructions again. The user says to extract the exact information from the context. Since the context uses French terms, the answer should present them as they are. However, the answer must be in English. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the user expects the answer in English but using the direct translations. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should be in French because that's how it's presented. The instructions say to answer in English, so I'll go with the translations. So the pattern for 'Mineral' is \"irregular sphericity\" for shape and \"very uneven\" for surface. Combining both, the answer would be \"irregular sphericity, very uneven\". That's concise and matches the context's data.\n</think>\n\n",

Since the second column corresponds to the rear window open (from row 1's header), that would be the value when the window is open. So the answer should be 84.6 dB. \n\nI need to confirm that \"en cours de travail (Kali 60)\" in row 4's second column is the correct entry. The question combines both the Kali 60 and the open rear window. Since the second column's header is \"Vitre arrière ouverte\", the 84.6 dB under that column for row 4 should be the correct value. \n\nNo other rows mention the rear window, so this must be the right data point. The answer is 84.6 dB.\n</think>\n\n84.6",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how often the condition of the vanes must be inspected. The context provided is in French, so I need to parse that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the term related to \"vanes.\" In the context, I see \"État pales\" which translates to \"Condition of the vanes\" or \"State of the vanes.\" The question is about the inspection interval for this.\n\nLooking at the table in the context, each row seems to represent a different maintenance task. The rows are numbered. For row 4, it says \"État pales\" and there's a bullet point (·) under the \"Tous les jours\" column? Wait, let me check again. The columns' headers are a bit fragmented. The headers listed are: \"Tous les jours\", \"Au bout de s 10 premières heur es\", \"Toutes les semaines\", \"Toutes les 100 heures\", \"Au moins 1 fois par an\", \"Comme recommandé\", \"Si usure\".\n\nLooking at row 4: \"État pales\" has a bullet under \"Tous les jours\" column. Wait, the columns might be the intervals. Each row's task is to be done at the intervals where there's a bullet. For row 4, \"État pales\" has a bullet under \"Tous les jours\" (every day) and maybe others? Let me check the exact line again.\n\nThe line for row 4 is: \"État pales ·\" followed by some spaces and then the page number 43. The bullet is under \"Tous les jours\"? The structure is a bit hard to parse because of the formatting. The columns are separated by spaces. Let me reconstruct the table:\n\nThe columns are:\n\n- Tous les jours (Every day)\n- Au bout de s 10 premières heures (After the first 10 hours)\n- Toutes les semaines (Every week)\n- Toutes les 100 heures (Every 100 hours)\n- Au moins 1 fois par an (At least once a year)\n- Comme recommandé (As recommended)\n- Si usure (If worn)\n\nLooking at row 4 (État pales):\n\nThe line is: \"État pales                ·                                                                                                                                                                     43\"\n\nThe bullet (·) is under the \"Tous les jours\" column. So the inspection for vanes (pales) must be done every day. \n\nWait, but in the context, there's another entry for row 4 again later? Let me check the entire context again. The context has two sections with similar tables. The first table starts at line 0 to line 9, and then there's another section starting again at line 132. But the question is about the interval for vanes, so focusing on the first table.\n\nSo the answer is \"Tous les jours\" which translates to \"Every day\". The user wants the answer in English, but the question says to base the answer strictly on the context. Wait, the instructions say to answer in English, but the context is in French. The question asks for the interval, so the exact term from the context is \"Tous les jours\". But the user wants the answer in English. Wait, the instructions say \"Answer in English\". So I should translate it to \"Daily\".\n\nWait, but the exact instruction says: \"Provide an extremely precise answer\" and \"Base your answer on the context\". The context uses \"Tous les jours\" for the interval. The user's question is in English, but the answer should be in English. So translating \"Tous les jours\" to \"Daily\" is correct. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be in the exact terms from the context, but since the user wants the answer in English, translating is okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interval is \"Every day\" as per the column header. The exact answer from the context is that the inspection is required every day because there's a bullet under \"Tous les jours\" for the \"État pales\" row. So the answer is \"Daily\" or \"Every day\".\n\nLooking at the context again, the exact line for row 4 is:\n\n4                                                        État pales                ·                                                                                                                                                                     43\n\nThe bullet is under the first column (Tous les jours). So the interval is every day. The answer should be \"Every day\".\n</think>\n\nEvery day",

The context has a table with different bolt sizes (like M22, M24) and corresponding torque values. However, the question is about M18, which I don't see listed here. The table starts at M22 and M24 for rows 9 and 10. Since M18 isn't in the rows provided, that's a red flag.\n\nNext, checking the columns. The columns list different qualities and friction coefficients. The user's bolt is 10.9 quality with 0.13 friction. In the table headers, there's a \"Couples de serrage.10.9.0,13\" column, which would be the 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. But since the rows are for M22 and M24, there's no M18 entry here.\n\nThe context also mentions that for threaded bolts and nuts, an additional 10% torque is needed, but that's probably if they have a different type like Tensilock or Whizlock. However, the question doesn't mention those, so maybe that's not applicable here. Also, there's a note about exceptions in the manuals, but without specific data for M18, we can't use that.\n\nSince the table doesn't include M18, the answer should be that the information isn't found in the provided context.

The user is asking for the torque in Nm required to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context has two main sections: one labeled \"Couples de serrage RVS\" and another \"Couples de serrage acier\". Since the question mentions stainless steel, I should check both sections to see which one applies. The term \"RVS\" might stand for stainless steel in French (Acier Inoxydable), so maybe the first section is for stainless steel bolts. The second section is about steel bolts (\"acier\"), so if the bolt is stainless, the first section is more relevant.\n\nLooking at the first section under \"Couples de serrage RVS\":\nThe table lists different qualities like 70 (A2) and friction coefficients like 0.10, 0.20, 0.30. The question specifies 70 (A2) and 0.2 friction, which would be the 0.20 column here. The M5 entry is there with values, but the user is asking about M6. Wait, the M5 row has values for 70 (A2) 0.10, 0.20, 0.30. However, the M6 isn't listed here. The next rows after M5 are numbered 0, 9, 10, but those might be row numbers. Wait, the formatting is a bit confusing. Let me parse the context again carefully.\n\nLooking at the context again:\n\nUnder the first section (RVS):\nThe rows start with \"0 M5 3.6 5.7 7 4.8 7.6 9.4\". The first column seems to be row numbers (like 0), then the bolt size (M5), then the quality (3.6?), followed by the torque values for different friction coefficients. But the question is about 70 (A2) quality. The headers for the columns after \"Qualité.Friction *.Filetage\" are a bit unclear. The columns after the quality might be the friction coefficients. Wait, the headers are:\n\nFor the first table (RVS):\nColumns after \"Qualité.Friction *.Filetage\" are listed as:\nCouples de serrage.70 (A2).0.10, then .0.20, .0.30, then 80 (A4) with 0.10, 0.20, 0.30.\n\nSo for a bolt with 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction (which is 0.20), the relevant column would be the third one under 70 (A2). Let's see the M5 row:\n\nM5 row: 3.6 (maybe the bolt's strength?), then 5.7 (for 0.10 friction?), 7 (for 0.20?), 4.8 (maybe next quality?), but this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the columns are arranged as:\n\nAfter the bolt size (M5), the next numbers correspond to the different quality and friction combinations. The headers are a bit merged. Let me try to parse the columns properly.\n\nThe first table's headers after \"Qualité.Friction *.Filetage\" are:\n\n- Couples de serrage.70 (A2).0.10\n- Couples de serrage.70 (A2).0.20\n- Couples de serrage.70 (A2).0.30\n- Couples de serrage.80 (A4).0.10\n- Couples de serrage.80 (A4).0.20\n- Couples de serrage.80 (A4).0.30.\n\nSo for each bolt size, the numbers under these columns would be the torque values. \n\nLooking at the M5 row:\n\nRow 0: M5, then 3.6 (maybe the bolt's class?), then 5.7 (for 70 A2 0.10), 7 (70 A2 0.20), 4.8 (next column which is 70 A2 0.30?), but that doesn't make sense because 4.8 is lower than 7. Wait, perhaps the numbers after the bolt size are for each of the columns in order. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0 (M5):\n- M5\n- 3.6 (maybe the bolt's strength class?)\n- 5.7 (70 A2 0.10)\n- 7 (70 A",

The beginning mentions pages 97 for procedures, but that's for different sections (\"Procédure en bout de champ\" and \"Épandage sur la parcelle\").

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about other kinds of connections the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for. First, I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nThe context mentions the IsoMatch Tellus command box and ISOBUS connectors. There's a part that says, \"Avec l'entrée capteur IsoMatch Tellus disponible en option, vous pouvez raccorder le capteur de vitesse du tracteur ou le radar au boîtier de commande IsoMatch Tellus.\" Translating that, it says that with the optional sensor input, you can connect the tractor's speed sensor or radar to the IsoMatch Tellus command box. \n\nAnother section states that an ISO cable is available for trailed spreaders, replacing a shorter cable. Also, there are mentions of RS232 connectors for communication between the Tellus command box and external systems. The question is about other connections besides the main ones. The key here is to find what else the cable can connect besides the standard setup.\n\nLooking at the details, the speed sensor and radar are mentioned as possible connections using the optional input. Additionally, the RS232 connection for external systems is another use. The answer should list these. The context also mentions cables for different radar types and spreaders, but those might be cable types rather than connection types. The question specifically asks for \"other kinds of connections,\" so the speed sensor, radar, and RS232 for external systems are the main points. \n\nWait, the question refers to the \"IM Tellus Input cable.\" The context says the input allows connecting speed sensor or radar. The RS232 is a separate connection method via a cable with an RS232 connector. So the answer should include those. Let me check again to ensure I'm not missing anything else. The answer needs to be precise and exact from the context. The exact phrases are \"capteur de vitesse du tracteur\" (tractor speed sensor), \"radar\", and the RS232 for external systems. \n\nSo the answer should list those three: tractor speed sensor, radar, and RS232 for external systems. But the question is about the Input cable's other uses. The input cable's optional use is for the sensor and radar. The RS232 is a different connection type via another cable. The question might be referring to the input cable's other purposes. The context says \"l'entrée capteur IsoMatch Tellus disponible en option\" allows those connections. So the answer is the tractor speed sensor and radar. The RS232 is a separate connection method mentioned, but maybe that's another use. The user's question is about the IM Tellus Input cable. The input cable's primary use is for ISOBUS, but with the optional input, you can connect those sensors. The RS232 is a different cable. So the answer should be the speed sensor and radar. The question is about \"other kinds of connections,\" so those are the additional ones besides the main ISOBUS connection. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer from the context is: the tractor's speed sensor or radar. Also, the RS232 for external systems. Wait, the RS232 part says \"communication via a RS232 connector\" using a cable with that connector. The question is about the IM Tellus Input cable. The input cable might be the standard one, but the optional input allows the sensors. The RS232 is a different connection type. The answer should include all other connections mentioned. Let me check the exact wording again. The question is about the \"IM Tellus Input cable\"—maybe the input cable refers to the optional sensor input. The context says \"entrée capteur IsoMatch Tellus disponible en option\" which allows connecting those sensors. The RS232 is a separate connection method. So the answer is the tractor speed sensor and radar. The RS232 is another connection type but via a different cable. The question is about the input cable's uses. So the answer is the speed sensor and radar. The other parts like spreaders and radar cables are types of cables, not the connection types. So the correct answer is the tractor speed sensor or radar.\n</think>\n\nThe IM Tellus Input cable can also be used for connecting the **tractor's speed sensor or radar** to the IsoMatch Tellus command box.",

But the specific action to stop might be closing the hopper tarp. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at the steps under the damage section: \"Vous devez d'abord (faire) réparer le dommage avant de continuer à épandre.\" So to stop spreading, you would not continue, but perhaps close the hopper. \n\nAnother part says: \"Refermez la bâche de trémie.\" which translates to \"Close the hopper tarp.\" This is mentioned in two places. The first instance is when you have blocks in the hopper and can't reduce them, you close the tarp and follow the damage procedure. \n\nThe question is about stopping the spreading. The exact steps to stop would be closing the hopper tarp. The answer should be \"Close the hopper tarp (Refermez la bâche de trémie).\" But need to check if there's a more precise instruction. \n\nAlternatively, the procedure under \"En cas de dommage\" says to introduce an object into the flow opening to prevent loss during transport. But the actual stopping might involve closing the tarp. \n\nThe answer should be the exact instruction given. The context says \"Refermez la bâche de trémie.\" So the precise answer is to close the hopper tarp. The user's question is in English, so the answer should be in English but based on the French context. The exact steps are to close the hopper tarp. \n\nWait, the question is \"How should one proceed to stop spreading the fertilizer?\" The context mentions that when you can't reduce a block or stuck fertilizer, you should close the hopper tarp and follow the damage procedure until the hopper is emptied. So the immediate step to stop spreading would be closing the hopper tarp. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Close the hopper tarp (Refermez la bâche de trémie).\"\n</think>\n\nClose the hopper tarp (Refermez la bâche de trémie).",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the appropriate measures for road transport when stopping work. The context provided is in French, so I need to parse that carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context for sections related to stopping work or leaving the tractor. The question mentions \"stopping work,\" so I should focus on steps to take before leaving or stopping work. \n\nLooking at the context, there's a section titled \"Avant de quitter le tracteur, vous devez :\" which translates to \"Before leaving the tractor, you must:\". That seems relevant because stopping work would involve leaving the tractor. The bullet points here list:\n\n- débrayer la prise de force (disengage the power take-off),\n- mettre hors pression le système hydraulique (depressurize the hydraulic system),\n- débrancher le système de commande électronique (disconnect the electronic control system).\n\nAdditionally, later in the context under \"Préparation de la machine pour le transport\" (Preparing the machine for transport), there are steps before using the public road. But the question is about stopping work, which aligns more with the \"Avant de quitter le tracteur\" section. \n\nAnother part mentions \"couper le contact sur le tracteur\" (switch off the tractor's ignition) and \"retirer la clé du contact\" (remove the key from the ignition), as well as \"serrer le frein à main sur le tracteur\" (engage the tractor's handbrake). These are also steps to take when stopping work. \n\nWait, the initial section \"Avant de quitter le tracteur\" lists three points, but further down in the preparation steps, there are more actions like switching off and removing the key, and engaging the handbrake. The user's question is about measures when stopping work, so all these steps are relevant. \n\nThe answer should list all the exact steps mentioned in the context under those sections. The key is to extract the exact phrases in French, but the answer needs to be in English as per instructions. Wait, no—the answer should be in English but based on the context. Wait, the instructions say \"Answer in English,\" so translate the steps into English precisely. \n\nSo compiling all the steps from \"Avant de quitter le tracteur\" and the subsequent steps under preparation that are part of stopping work:\n\n- Disengage the power take-off,\n- Depressurize the hydraulic system,\n- Disconnect the electronic control system,\n- Switch off the tractor's ignition,\n- Remove the key from the ignition,\n- Engage the tractor's handbrake.\n\nWait, but in the context, under \"Préparation de la machine pour le transport\", the steps include checking things, but the specific steps when stopping work (leaving the tractor) are in the first list. The later part under preparation also mentions \"couper le contact...\", so that's part of the preparation before moving, but also applies when stopping work. \n\nThe user's question is about measures to take when stopping work, which would be the steps before leaving the tractor. So the correct answer should list all those steps. The answer needs to be precise and in English. Let me check again the exact context:\n\n\"Avant de quitter le tracteur, vous devez :\n· débrayer la prise de force,\n· mettre hors pression le système hydraulique,\n· débrancher le système de commande électronique,\nPréparation de la machine pour le transport\n...\n Contrôlez toutes les parties escamotables et vérifiez leur verrouillage :\n· jupe,\n· débrancher le système de commande électronique,\n· couper le contact sur le tracteur,\n· retirer la clé du contact,\n· serrer le frein à main sur le tracteur.\"\n\nWait, the last bullet point under \"Contrôlez toutes les parties escamotables...\" includes:\n\n- débrancher le système de commande électronique (disconnect the electronic control system again? Maybe a repetition),\n- couper le contact (switch off ignition),\n- retirer la clé (remove key),\n- serrer le frein à main (engage handbrake).\n\nSo combining both sections: when stopping work (quitting the tractor), the steps are the three in the first list plus the four in the last bullet. Wait, the first list is \"Avant de quitter le tracteur\" which has three items. Then under preparation for transport, there's another section where after checking retractable parts, they list those steps. But the user's question is about stopping work, so the primary steps are from \"Avant de quitter le tracteur\" and the subsequent steps in that same section? Or is the preparation for transport a separate step?\n\nThe question is about measures to take when stopping work, which would be the steps before leaving the tractor. The first three points are clear. The later steps under \"Contrôlez",

I need to look through the provided context to find the exact reason.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for any mention of fertiliser absorbing or attracting water. The context is in French, so I need to make sure I understand the key phrases. \n\nLooking at the first bullet point: \"l'engrais humide dans la bague d'écoulement a formé un bloc...\" which talks about wet fertilizer forming a block. Then there's a note that says \"La plupart des types d'engrais absorbent l'eau et peuvent alors former des blocs.\" Translating that: \"Most types of fertilizer absorb water and can then form blocks.\" \n\nThis seems directly relevant. The question is about why they attract water, and here it states they absorb water, leading to block formation. The next part mentions that this can cause blockages or damage. \n\nFurther down, under \"Opérations avant l'épandage,\" the same sentence is repeated: \"La plupart des types d'engrais absorbent l'eau et peuvent alors former des blocs.\" So the key point here is the absorption of water. \n\nThe user's question is about attracting water, which in this context is explained as absorption. The exact answer should be the direct reason from the text. Since the context doesn't provide a deeper explanation like chemical properties, the answer is simply that they absorb water. \n\nI need to ensure there's no other part of the text that gives another reason. Scanning again, other points mention humidity causing blocks when left in the spreader or not cleaning it, but those are consequences, not the reason why they attract water. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is that most fertilisers absorb water, as stated explicitly in the context. No other information is given for the cause beyond absorption. So the answer should be the exact phrase from the context: \"absorb water\".\n</think>\n\nMost types of fertiliser attract water because they **absorb water**. \n\nExact source:  \n\"La plupart des types d'engrais absorbent l'eau et peuvent alors former des blocs.\"  \n(\"Most types of fertilizer absorb water and can then form blocks.\")",

First, I need to look at the provided context carefully.\n\nThe context is in French, so I'll need to parse that. The first section talks about what to do if you've been injured and possibly exposed to chemicals. It says to rinse the contact area abundantly with water and consult a doctor immediately. The rest of the context discusses machinery issues like damaged blades or spreader disks and how to handle those, plus some troubleshooting for fertilizer spreading problems related to weather conditions.\n\nThe question is about a person who fell into fertilizer and can't see a physician. The key part here is the first part of the context regarding chemical exposure. The instructions say to clean the area with lots of water and then see a doctor. But the question states that a physician isn't available. The context doesn't provide alternative steps if a doctor isn't accessible. It strictly says to consult a médecin sans tarder (without delay). Since there's no additional advice given for scenarios without a physician, the answer should stick to what's written. The user might be expecting the first step (cleaning with water), but the question specifically asks what to do when no physician is available. However, the context doesn't mention any other steps beyond contacting a doctor after rinsing. So the answer should include the rinsing step but also note that the next required step (seeing a doctor) isn't possible here. But since the question is asking what should be done in that situation, maybe the answer is just the first step, but the instructions say to base strictly on the context. Since the context doesn't provide an alternative, perhaps the answer is just the cleaning part, but the problem is the question's scenario excludes the physician. Wait, the exact context says \"consult a médecin sans tarder\" after cleaning. If the physician isn't available, the context doesn't give another instruction. So the answer would be to clean with water, but since the next step is mandatory and not possible, maybe the answer is just the first step. But the user's question is what should they do in that specific case. The context doesn't address the absence of a physician, so maybe the answer is just the first step, but the instructions require being precise. Alternatively, since the context doesn't have info on no physician available, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". Wait, the question is asking for what should be done when a physician isn't available. The context says to consult a physician, but if that's not possible, the context doesn't say.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what happens if the machine's grease nipples are never lubricated. I need to look through the provided context to find any information related to not lubricating the grease nipples and the consequences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for mentions of lubrication and the effects of not doing it. The context has several points about greasing. It says to grease the grease nipples (Graissez les graisseurs de la machine) and mentions that if you don't, there might be issues. \n\nLooking at the first sentence in the context: \"arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents au cours du travail avec la machine.\" Translated, that means \"less frequent stops related to incidents during work with the machine.\" Wait, but that's in the beginning. Hmm, maybe that's saying that proper greasing leads to fewer stops. So the opposite, not greasing, would lead to more frequent stops or incidents?\n\nAnother part says: \"N'utilisez jamais de nettoyeur haute pression sur les joints d'étanchéité et les bouchons de purge d'air. Vous éviterez ainsi toute pénétration de saleté et d'humidité dans les boîtiers de pignons.\" But that's about cleaning, not directly about greasing the nipples.\n\nWait, the key part might be in the first line. The original context starts with \"arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents au cours du travail avec la machine.\" So if you don't grease, the stops would be more frequent. The question is about what happens if they are never lubricated. The context says that greasing leads to less frequent stops, so not doing it would result in more frequent stops due to incidents. \n\nIs there any other part that mentions consequences of not greasing? Let me check again. The maintenance section mentions applying grease to protect parts from corrosion and using the right type of grease. But the direct consequence from not greasing the nipples is implied in the first sentence. Since the instruction says to grease them to prevent less frequent stops, the inverse would be more stops. \n\nThe answer should be based strictly on the context. The exact phrase is \"arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents\" which translates to \"less frequent stops related to incidents\". Therefore, not lubricating would lead to more frequent stops (i.e., more stops related to incidents). \n\nSo the answer is that not lubricating the grease nipples leads to more frequent stops due to incidents. The exact wording from the context is the first line, so the answer is the negation of that benefit. Since the user wants the exact information from the context, the direct answer is that not greasing would result in more frequent stops linked to incidents. The original sentence says that greasing leads to less frequent stops, so the opposite is the consequence of not doing it. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is: \"arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents\" implies that without lubrication, the stops would be more frequent. But the question is in English, so the answer should be translated but using the exact context's information. The context's first line states that proper greasing leads to less frequent stops. Hence, the answer is that not lubricating would result in more frequent stops related to incidents during work with the machine.\n</think>\n\nThe context states that greasing the machine's grease nipples leads to \"arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents au cours du travail avec la machine\" (\"less frequent stops related to incidents during work with the machine\"). The inverse implication is that **not lubricating the grease nipples would result in more frequent stops due to incidents**. \n\nAnswer: [arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents au cours du travail avec la machine] → **Increased stops/incidents during work** (exact inverse of the stated benefit). \n\nHowever, since the question asks for the consequence of *never lubricating*, the precise answer derived from the context is:  \n**\"arrêts moins fréquents\" implies that without lubrication, stops related to incidents would be more frequent.**  \n\nBut strictly adhering to the context's explicit wording (no direct statement about *not* lubricating), the closest exact answer is:  \n**\"less frequent stops related to incidents\" is prevented by lubrication. Thus, not lubricating would lead to the opposite: more frequent stops linked to incidents.**  \n\nFinal concise answer based on context's first line:  \n**\"arrêts moins fréquents liés à des incidents\" → Without lubrication, stops due to incidents would be more frequent.**  \n\nBut since the question requires an **exact** answer from the context, and the context only states the benefit of lubrication (not the consequence of neglect), the precise answer is:  \n**Unknown** (as",

The user is asking about the type of protective safety gloves needed for cleaning fertilizer remnants from the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD before welding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context is in French, so I'll have to parse that carefully. The section titled \"Opérations avant l'épandage\" mentions that during machine filling, one can come into contact with products, so protective clothing like protective gloves, safety shoes, and protective goggles should be worn. It also refers to following the manufacturer's safety instructions.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the kind of gloves. The context says \"des gants protecteurs\" which translates to \"protective gloves.\" However, it doesn't specify the material or type beyond \"protective.\" There's no mention of gloves needed for welding or cleaning fertilizer before welding. The context talks about general handling and mixing of fertilizers, not the welding process itself. \n\nLooking further, the rest of the context includes machine details like model Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD GS3, but no additional info on gloves. The \"Réactions chimiques liées au mélange d'engrais\" part warns about mixing fertilizers but again, no specifics on glove types. \n\nSince the question is about cleaning before welding, maybe there's a step I'm missing. But the context doesn't mention welding at all. The safety instructions are general for handling fertilizers. The answer must be strictly based on the context. Since it only says \"protective gloves\" without specifying material (like chemical-resistant or heat-resistant), the exact info given is just \"protective gloves.\" The user might need a specific type, but the context doesn't provide that detail. \n\nTherefore, the answer should state the exact term from the text, which is \"protective gloves,\" even though it's general. Since the question asks for the kind needed for cleaning fertilizer remnants before welding, but the context doesn't mention welding, maybe the answer is still the protective gloves mentioned, as that's the only reference. Alternatively, if welding introduces a different requirement not in the context, then it's unknown. But the question ties it to cleaning fertilizer remnants, so the context's advice on handling fertilizers applies here. \n\nHence, the answer is \"protective gloves\" as per the context. There's no more specific information provided.\n</think>\n\nprotective gloves",

The main topics here are the IsoMatch Tellus and IsoMatch Tellus GO systems, their compatibility with ISOBUS, and some features related to communication protocols.\n\nLooking for mentions of ISOBUS protocol versions. The context states that the IsoMatch system uses the ISOBUS communication protocol and is compatible with tractors equipped with ISOBUS. There's a mention of connecting via a 9-pin cable connector for IsoMatch Tellus. However, I don't see any specific versions of ISOBUS mentioned, like ISO 11783 or 11784, which are standard versions. The text also talks about the Tellus GO having fewer USB ports and no WLAN/WiFi compared to the standard Tellus, but that's about the hardware, not the protocol specs.\n\nThe question is about technical specs and bandwidth. The context mentions continuous measurement of fertilizer quantity via sensors, comparison with set rates, and correction by opening/closing the dosing unit. It also refers to measuring real speed and location via tractor electronics or GPS. But none of these details relate to bandwidth or specific protocol versions' technical data.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide information on different ISOBUS versions (like ISO 11783 A, B, or others) or their bandwidth capabilities (e.g., 125 kbit/s, 250 kbit/s), the answer should reflect that this information isn't present.

The main points are about granulometry, which relates to the size distribution of the fertilizer grains. The context mentions different diameter ranges and their effects on spreading. \n\nLooking at the bullet points under \"Instructions à propos de la granulométrie\", there are three scenarios. The second point says that if 80-100% of the grains are between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertilizer is easy to spread. The third point mentions that if 20% or more are over 4.75 mm, it's difficult to spread optimally and may cause damage. \n\nThe question is about preventing blockage. The first bullet point talks about small particles (<2.0mm causing issues, but the user is asking about the maximum size. The key here is the upper limit. The third bullet's threshold is 4.75mm. If over that, problems occur. So the maximum acceptable to avoid issues (like blockage) would be 4.75mm. The context also mentions cleaning the sieve to prevent obstruction, which relates to particle size. Since exceeding 4.75mm in a significant portion causes problems, the maximum acceptable chunk size to prevent blockage would be 4.75mm. \n\nI need to confirm if the context explicitly states this as the maximum.

The user is asking about the tolerance for the measured distance from the bottom of the vanes to the ground or crop in centimeters. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The question mentions \"measured distance from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop.\" The key here is to find any mention of a required distance and its tolerance.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a part that says: \"Si la hauteur exigée de 75 cm au-dessus de la végétation n'est pas réalisable avec votre dispositif de levage :\" which translates to \"If the required height of 75 cm above the vegetation is not achievable with your lifting device...\" So the required height is 75 cm. \n\nThe question is about the tolerance. The next part mentions adjustments if the deviation (écart) is over 25%. The term \"écart\" here likely refers to the deviation from the required 75 cm. The context says when the écart is superior to 25%, you have to adjust the spreading disc speed and retest until the écart is under 25%. \n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the tolerance in cm. The 25% might be the tolerance percentage, but the question wants the actual distance. Wait, maybe the 75 cm is the required height, and the tolerance is 25% of that? Let me check again. \n\nThe exact phrase is \"Lorsque l'écart est supérieur à 25 % :\" which translates to \"When the deviation exceeds 25%:\" So the deviation (écart) being over 25% of what? Probably the required 75 cm. So 25% of 75 cm is 18.75 cm. But the question is asking for the tolerance, which might be that 25% threshold. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"tolerance for the measured distance\". The context says that if the deviation (from the required 75 cm) is over 25%, you have to adjust. So the allowed tolerance before needing adjustment is 25% of 75 cm. But the question might be looking for the 25% figure as the tolerance percentage. However, the user is asking for the tolerance in cm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the required distance is 75 cm, and the tolerance is that you must stay within 25% deviation. But the exact wording in the context is that when the deviation is over 25%, you have to make adjustments. So the tolerance (the allowable deviation) is up to 25% of 75 cm. \n\nBut the question is asking for the tolerance in cm. So 25% of 75 cm is 18.75 cm. But the context doesn't explicitly state the tolerance in cm, only as a percentage. The question might be expecting the percentage, but the user specified \"in cm\". Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the tolerance for the distance (which is 75 cm). The context says that if the deviation (from 75 cm) is over 25%, you have to adjust. So the tolerance is 25% of the required 75 cm. But the user wants the answer in cm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tolerance is that the distance must be kept within 75 cm ±25%? But the question is phrased as \"tolerance for the measured distance\", which might refer to the allowable deviation. Since the context says when the deviation exceeds 25%, then the tolerance is 25% of 75 cm. \n\nBut the user wants the answer in centimeters. Let me check again. The exact context says \"l'écart est supérieur à 25 %\" which is the deviation exceeding 25%. The required height is 75 cm. So the tolerance (the allowable deviation) is 25% of 75 cm, which is 18.75 cm. But the question might be expecting the percentage, but the user specified cm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the tolerance is that the distance must be maintained at exactly 75 cm, and any deviation over 25% (from that 75 cm) requires adjustment. So the tolerance is 25% of 75 cm, but expressed as a percentage. However, the question asks for the tolerance in cm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the required distance being 75 cm, and the tolerance is that you can't deviate more than 25% from that. So the maximum allowed deviation is 25% of 75 cm, which is 18.75 cm. But the question is asking for",

The context is in French, so I need to pay attention to keywords like \"vent\" (wind) and \"vitesse\" (speed). \n\nLooking at the first entry under context, there's a section that mentions \"vitesses élevées du vent (> 5m/s)\" which translates to \"high wind speeds (>5 m/s)\". The recommendation here is to proceed only when meteorological conditions are favorable. \n\nFurther down, there's another bullet point: \"Ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitesses supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" This translates to \"Do not spread when the wind speed exceeds 3 m/s (wind force 2).\" \n\nHmm, there are two different numbers here: 5 m/s and 3 m/s. The question is about the limit before quality becomes unacceptable. The 5 m/s is mentioned in a list of bad conditions, but the more specific instruction later says not to spread above 3 m/s. The second mention is a direct recommendation, so that's probably the correct answer. The first mention might be part of a problem description, while the instruction with 3 m/s is the actual guideline. \n\nI need to ensure which one is the actual limit given as advice. The bullet point with 3 m/s is a clear instruction not to proceed above that speed, so that's the limit. The 5 m/s might be part of a different context or an older reference.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for the application rate. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context is in French, so I'll have to make sure I understand the key points. The question is about speed reduction percentage, so I should focus on parts mentioning speed or adjustments to the tractor's settings.\n\nLooking at the first section under \"Épandage à partir des voies de pulvérisation (situation A)\", there's a point that says \"Réduisez la vitesse de l'arbre de prise de force à 75%.\" Translating that, it means \"Reduce the PTO (power take-off) speed to 75%.\" The PTO speed is related to the tractor's engine speed, which in turn affects the application rate of the spreader. \n\nAnother part mentions adjusting the dosage unit and mentions speed again: \"Sélectionnez un rapport vous permettant de rouler à la même vitesse qu'avec un régime de prise de force normal, ou réduisez le débit de 25%.\" This translates to \"Select a gear that allows you to drive at the same speed as with normal PTO speed, or reduce the flow by 25%.\" Here, there's a mention of reducing the flow by 25%, but the question is about speed reduction. However, the first point about reducing PTO speed to 75% directly relates to speed. \n\nWait, the question is about the driving speed reduction percentage. The first instruction under situation A says to reduce the PTO speed to 75%, which might be equivalent to reducing the speed by 25% (since 100% - 75% = 25%). But the second part talks about reducing the flow by 25% if you keep the same driving speed. The user is asking specifically about the driving speed, not the flow rate. \n\nThe key here is whether \"vitesse de l'arbre de prise de force\" (PTO speed) is the same as the driving speed. The PTO speed is often linked to the engine RPM, which can be related to the tractor's speed if the gear is adjusted. However, the question is about the driving speed. The instruction says to reduce the PTO speed to 75%, but the driving speed might be adjusted via gears. The second point says you can either select a gear to maintain the same driving speed (so PTO is reduced) or reduce the flow by 25%. \n\nThe user's question is about the speed reduction percentage for driving. The first instruction under situation A specifies reducing the PTO speed to 75%, which might mean the driving speed is adjusted to maintain that PTO. Alternatively, if the driving speed is being reduced, perhaps the 25% reduction is mentioned elsewhere. Wait, the second point says \"réduisez le débit de 25 %\" which is flow rate, not speed. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is 25% reduction in speed? Wait, no. The first instruction says to reduce the PTO speed to 75% of normal. So that's a 25% reduction from the normal PTO speed. But the question is about driving speed. Unless the driving speed is directly tied to the PTO speed. If the tractor's forward speed is adjusted so that the PTO runs at 75%, then the driving speed might be adjusted proportionally. But the exact percentage for driving speed isn't explicitly stated. \n\nWait, the second instruction says \"Sélectionnez un rapport vous permettant de rouler à la même vitesse qu'avec un régime de prise de force normal\" which means you can select a gear to maintain the same driving speed while reducing PTO, or reduce flow by 25%. So the driving speed isn't being reduced here; instead, the PTO is. The question is about the driving speed reduction. \n\nLooking again, maybe the answer is 25% reduction in the PTO speed, but the question is about driving speed. Since the user is asking for driving speed, perhaps the answer is not directly stated. Wait, the first instruction says \"Réduisez la vitesse de l'arbre de prise de force à 75%.\" The PTO speed is part of the tractor's operation, but the driving speed (how fast the tractor is moving forward) might be a separate factor. The question is about driving speed, so maybe the answer is not present. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the 25% reduction in flow rate as a compensation, but the question specifies speed. Since the context mentions reducing PTO speed to 75%, but not the driving speed percentage, perhaps the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". Wait, but",

The term \"tolerance\" might imply a range, but the context just states \"environ 2 mètres,\" which is \"approximately 2 meters.\" However, the exact number given is 2 meters. The question asks for the distance tolerance, but the context doesn't specify a range like 2±0.5 or anything. It just says approximately 2. \n\nHmm, maybe \"environ\" (approximately) suggests there's a tolerance, but the exact figure provided is 2. Since the instructions say to be precise and base the answer strictly on the context, perhaps the answer is 2 meters. The user might be looking for that exact number. \n\nLooking further, the next bullet points talk about the second passage being 1 largeur de travail (X meters) away.
