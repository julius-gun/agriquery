The context mentions \"working width\" several times. Let me look for parts that explain what determines it. \n\nIn the section under \"Use spreading chart,\" there's a part that says: \"Various types of fertiliser have a limited maximum working width. This is due to their physical qualities whereby they do not spread evenly over large working widths.\" So the physical qualities of the fertilizer affect the maximum working width. \n\nAnother part says, \"The working width is adjusted with: · the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and · the discharge point.\" So adjusting the connection point and discharge point determines the working width. \n\nWait, the question is about what determines the working width. The answer should include both factors: the physical qualities of the fertilizer (which set the maximum width) and the mechanical adjustments (connection point and discharge point). But the question is phrased as \"determines the machine's working width,\" which might refer to the factors that set or adjust it. \n\nThe context says that the working width is adjusted using those two mechanical factors. Also, the fertilizer type has a maximum width. So the answer should mention both the physical properties of the fertilizer and the mechanical adjustments. However, the exact answer needs to be precise. Let me check again.\n\nThe exact sentence: \"The working width is adjusted with: · the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and · the discharge point.\" So the working width is determined by those two factors. Additionally, the fertilizer's physical qualities limit the maximum working width. But the question is about what determines the working width, which could be the factors that set it. The answer should be the two mechanical factors. However, the context also mentions that the working width is adjusted using those, so the answer is those two elements. \n\nWait, the user's question is about what determines the working width. The context says that the working width is adjusted with those two factors. So the answer is those two factors. But the fertilizer's physical qualities affect the maximum width, but that's a limitation, not a determinant. The question is about what determines the working width, which is set by the mechanical adjustments. So the answer should be the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and the discharge point. \n\nBut the answer needs to be precise. The exact answer from the context is: \"The working width is adjusted with: · the correct connection point for the coupling shaft with the PTO speed and · the discharge point.\" So the answer is those two factors.

Specifically, it says the tray test should be done with dry weather, low humidity, and a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2). \n\nThen, looking at the other parts, there's a note about not spreading with wind speeds over 3 m/s (wind force 2).

The user is asking what poses a continued danger after disengaging the PTO shaft and why. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the context provided. The context mentions several safety procedures, especially around the PTO shaft. There's a section that says, \"After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance to the machine until the moving parts have come to a complete stop. Approaching the machine while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.\"\n\nSo the key points here are that even after turning off the PTO shaft, the machine might still be running due to inertia. The danger is that the moving parts haven't stopped yet, and approaching the machine could lead to injuries. The reason is inertia causing the machine to continue running.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is precise and directly answers the question. The answer should mention the continued danger (machine continuing to run due to inertia) and the reason (inertia causing movement). Also, the consequence is the risk of injury from approaching the machine while it's still rotating. \n\nI should check if there are other parts of the context that mention this. There are repeated mentions of the PTO shaft rotating after disengaging, but they all point to the same cause and effect. The other sections talk about environmental protection and working in a closed cabin, which aren't relevant here. \n\nSo the answer should be concise, stating that the continued danger is the machine running due to inertia, leading to potential injuries if approached. The exact wording needs to match the context as closely as possible.\n</think>\n\nThe machine continues to run due to inertia after disengaging the PTO shaft, posing a danger of serious or deadly injuries if approached while moving parts are still rotating.",

Also, the measurement accuracy gets worse, and even if you try to recalibrate, it won't improve the discharge curve. \n\nThe question is specifically about what happens when the hopper is below 100 kg.

Wait, maybe the wording is a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the exact sentence: \"This meter has 4 sections, with seven parts.\" So the meter has 4 sections, and seven parts.

The original EC declaration doesn't mention weight. So the only place where numbers are listed for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD are those four numbers. Since the question is about the 3900 model, the answer is 3900 kg. But I need to check if the units are specified. The context doesn't explicitly state the units for those numbers, but since the question asks for kg, and the numbers are in the same line as \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\", it's likely they are in kg. Therefore, the answer is 3900 kg.\n</think>\n\n[The context does not explicitly state the weight in kg of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900.

However, the key part here is whether there's any mention of how often these checks should be performed.\n\nLooking through the context, the steps are all about the procedure to adjust and set up the equipment, but there's no explicit statement about the interval at which these checks need to be done. For example, the instructions say to check the height again and adjust if necessary, but that's part of the adjustment process, not a recurring interval. The other questions listed under \"Did you check the following settings?\" are about verifying settings, but again, they don't specify a time frame.\n\nThe user might be expecting an answer based on standard maintenance practices, but the instructions here don't mention any specific intervals like daily, weekly, or after certain hours. Since the context doesn't provide information on the frequency, the correct response would be that it's not mentioned. The answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The user is asking how often the agitator seal must be replaced, specifically the interval.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context is a maintenance procedure for a machine, probably agricultural, involving steps to replace parts like the metal seal rings and the fertiliser sealing ring. \n\nLooking for mentions of replacement intervals. There's a sentence that says: \"The agitator axle is equipped with a plastic seal to prevent fertiliser granule loss along the agitator axle. The seal must be replaced every season, as well as after every 100 operational hours.\" \n\nSo the key points here are \"every season\" and \"after every 100 operational hours.\" The question is about the interval, so both these time frames are relevant. The answer should include both intervals as they are both specified in the context. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of replacement intervals elsewhere in the text. Scanning through the rest of the context, the other steps are about maintenance procedures but don't mention replacement intervals again. \n\nTherefore, the answer should state that the agitator seal must be replaced every season and after every 100 operational hours.

The answer needs to be precise and concise, matching the exact information from the context.\n</think>\n\nThe agitator seal must be replaced every season and after every 100 operational hours.",

The user is asking for the torque in Nm required to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context provided. The context has two main sections: one about stainless steel tightening torques and another about steel tightening torques. The question specifies \"stainless steel,\" so I should focus on the first section.\n\nLooking at the first section, under \"Stainless steel tightening torques,\" there's a table. The rows are labeled with numbers 0, 1, etc., and the columns are M5, M6, etc. The friction coefficients are mentioned as 0.10 and 0.20. Wait, the context mentions \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20.\" So for quality 70 (A2), the friction coefficients are 0.10 and 0.20. \n\nThe user's question specifies a friction of 0.2. Looking at the table, under the M6 column, the values for 0.20 friction are listed. Let me check the numbers. The line for M6 under the 0.20 friction is 12.2 Nm. Wait, but the context has a line: \"0                         M5                   3.6                   5.7                     7                   4.8                   7.6                   9.4\" and then \"1                         M6                   6.3                   9.9                  12.2                   8.4                  13.2                  16.3\". Wait, the numbers might be in different columns. Let me re-examine the structure.\n\nThe context seems to have lines where each line starts with a number (0, 1, etc.), followed by M5, M6, etc., and then the torque values. The first line after \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20.\" is \"0                         M5                   3.6                   5.7                     7                   4.8                   7.6                   9.4\". Then \"1                         M6                   6.3                   9.9                  12.2                   8.4                  13.2                  16.3\". \n\nSo for M6, the torque values under 0.10 and 0.20 friction. Wait, the first line (0) is for M5, then the next line (1) is for M6. The numbers after M6 are 6.3, 9.9, 12.2, 8.4, 13.2, 16.3. But how are these columns structured? The original context might have columns for different friction coefficients. The first part mentions \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20.\" So maybe the first set of numbers is for 0.10 friction, and the next for 0.20. But the exact alignment is a bit unclear. However, the user is asking for 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction. \n\nLooking at the line for M6, the third value (since 0.10 is first, 0.20 is second?) might be 12.2 Nm. Wait, the line for M6 is \"1                         M6                   6.3                   9.9                  12.2                   8.4                  13.2                  16.3\". If the first number after M6 is 6.3 for 0.10, then 9.9 for 0.20? Or maybe the numbers are for different friction coefficients. Alternatively, the first set of numbers (6.3, 9.9, 12.2) might be for 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and the next set (8.4, 13.2, 16.3) for another quality? Wait, the initial part says \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).",

The context has several entries, some with numbers like 5, 6, 7, etc. The question mentions \"page,\" so I should check if any of these numbers refer to pages. \n\nLooking at line 5: \"Incorrect application rates (kg per hectare) New type of fertiliser spread with the same settings as the previous type. Quality varies greatly between types. Determine the characteristics of the fertiliser, look for the relevant spreading chart and set the spreader again 57, 62\".

Again, the page numbers 57 and 62 are mentioned in line 5. \n\nThe user's question is about the flow being blocked. The answer in the context for that specific issue (line 6) says to clean the machine and replace the agitator. However, the question also asks which page to look at. The numbers 57 and 62 are associated with the incorrect application rates in line 5, which might be pages. But the exact instruction about the blocked flow is in line 6, which doesn't mention a page. \n\nWait, maybe the numbers 57 and 62 are page numbers for the spreading charts. The user needs to look at those pages for the correct settings. However, the question is about the blocked flow, which is addressed in line 6. The answer for the blocked flow is to clean the machine and replace the agitator, but the page reference is in line 5. \n\nSo the answer should be: Look at page 57 or 62 for the spreading chart. But the user's question is about what to do when the flow is blocked. The context says to clean the machine and replace the agitator. However, the page numbers are mentioned in line 5. \n\nWait, the question is asking two things: what to do and which page to look at. The answer for the blocked flow is to clean the machine and replace the agit, but the page reference is in line 5. So the answer would be to look at page 57 or 62.

But the user's question is about the blocked flow. The context says that if the flow is blocked, you should clean the machine and replace the agitator. However, the page numbers are mentioned in line 5. So the answer is to look at pages 57 or 62 for the spreading chart. \n\nWait, the question is asking what to do and which page to look at.

The other connections made via the Input IM Tellus cable are the ISO 11786 In cab, and maybe the other connections mentioned under the standard item. Wait, the standard item includes the ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. But the question is about the IM Tellus Input cable. The context says \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" So the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those other connections. Wait, the first part says that if the tractor has a full ISOBUS connection, the 9-point cable is sufficient, but other connections are via the Input IM Tellus cable. Then, the standard item includes the ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. So the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those. Therefore, the answer should be that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input connections. But the question is about \"other kind of connections\" besides the main one. Wait, the question is asking for other connections that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for. The main connection is the ISO 11786 In cab. The other connections mentioned in the context under the standard item are lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. So the answer should list those. But the user's question is about the IM Tellus Input cable. The context says that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for ISO 11786 In cab, and other connections are made via the same cable. So the other connections are the ones listed under the standard item. Therefore, the answer is that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input connections. But the question is phrased as \"other kind of connections\", so",

Let me scan through each part.\n\nThe first point mentions that if 80-100% of the granules are between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, it's good to spread. But that's about spreadability, not blockage. \n\nThen there's a part about if 20% or more of the granules are larger than 4.75 mm, it's difficult to distribute and could damage crops. Again, this is about distribution issues, not blockage specifically.\n\nAnother section talks about if 10% or more of the granules are smaller than 2.0 mm, it's hard to spread, especially with large widths. This could lead to less optimal distribution and crop damage. Still, this is about spreadability and damage, not blockage.\n\nThe question is about preventing blockage. The context doesn't mention anything about blockage directly. The terms used are about spreadability, distribution, and crop damage. There's no mention of a maximum size to prevent blockage. \n\nThe user might be confusing blockage with other issues, but based on the given context, there's no information on the maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. The closest is the 2.0 mm lower limit, but that's for spreadability, not blockage.

The user is asking about the type of active carbon filters recommended for closed tractor cabins to filter fertilizer dust.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context mentions several times the importance of using a closed cabin with active carbon filters. The key sentence here is: \"It is therefore recommended to always work with a closed cabin with active carbon filters in the air inlets.\" \n\nWait, the question is about the type of filters. But the context doesn't specify the type, like whether they're HEPA filters or something else. It just says \"active carbon filters.\" The context doesn't mention any specific model, brand, or type beyond that. \n\nSo the answer should be exactly what's stated. The context doesn't provide more details. Therefore, the answer is that active carbon filters are recommended, but the type isn't specified. Since the question asks for the type, and the context doesn't mention any specific type, the correct response would be that the information isn't found. But wait, the instruction says if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n\nBut wait, the context says \"active carbon filters\" without specifying a type. The question is asking for the type, but the answer is just \"active carbon filters.\" However, maybe the answer is that the filters are active carbon filters, which is the type. Wait, the question is phrased as \"What type of 'active carbon filters'...\" So the answer is that the recommended type is active carbon filters. But the context doesn't specify any further type. So the answer is that the recommended filters are active carbon filters. But the user might be expecting a specific type, but the context doesn't mention it. Therefore, the answer should be that the context doesn't specify the type beyond active carbon filters. But the question is asking for the type, and the answer is active carbon filters. Wait, maybe the answer is that the type is active carbon filters. But the context doesn't say \"type of active carbon filters,\" it just says to use active carbon filters. So the answer is that the recommended filters are active carbon filters. But the question is phrased as \"type of 'active carbon filters'\". So maybe the answer is that the type is active carbon filters. But the context doesn't specify any further details. Therefore, the answer is that the context states active carbon filters are recommended, but doesn't specify a type beyond that. Hence, the answer should be \"active carbon filters\" as the type. Wait, but the question is asking for the type of active carbon filters. Since the context doesn't mention any specific type, like HEPA or something else, the answer is that the type is active carbon filters. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the context doesn't specify the type beyond active carbon filters, so the answer is \"Not found in context.\" But the context does mention active carbon filters, so the answer is that the recommended type is active carbon filters. Wait, the question is phrased as \"What type of 'active carbon filters'...\" which might be a bit confusing. The answer is that the type is active carbon filters.

The user is asking about speed reduction percentage, but this part mentions reducing the application rate by 25% if you select a gear for the same speed as the normal PTO shaft. \n\nWait, the question is about driving speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't explicitly mention a percentage for speed reduction. Instead, it talks about reducing the application rate by 25% if you don't adjust the speed.

However, the user is asking for the optimal driving speed reduction percentage.

It just says \"universal grease type\" without specifying further details like brand or specific type (e.g., lithium-based, etc.). \n\nThe user's question is asking for the exact type recommended. Since the context only mentions that a universal grease type is used but doesn't provide the specific name or type beyond that, the answer would have to be that it's a universal grease type as specified. However, the instruction says to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. But wait, the context does mention \"universal grease type\" as the type recommended, even though it doesn't give more details. So the answer is that the universal grease type is recommended, but since the question is about the type, and the context doesn't specify beyond \"universal,\" maybe the answer is that it's a universal grease type. However, the user might be expecting a specific name, but the context doesn't provide that. Therefore, the correct answer based on the context is that the universal grease type is recommended, but since the question asks for the type, and the context doesn't specify beyond \"universal,\" the answer would be that the universal grease type is recommended. Wait, the exact wording in the context is \"universal grease type,\" so the answer is that the universal grease type is recommended. But the user might be looking for a specific type, but the context doesn't mention it. Therefore, the answer should be that the universal grease type is recommended, but since the question is about the type, and the context doesn't specify further, the answer is \"universal grease type.\" However, the instruction says to answer based on the context. Since the context says \"universal grease type\" is used, the answer is that the recommended type is universal grease type. But the user might be expecting a specific name, but the context doesn't provide that. Therefore, the answer is \"universal grease type\" as per the context. However, the question is phrased as \"What type of 'universal grease' is recommended...\" which might imply that the answer is \"universal grease type,\" but the context doesn't specify a particular type beyond that. Therefore, the answer is that the universal grease type is recommended, but since the context doesn't give more details, the answer is \"universal grease type.\" Wait, the exact sentence is \"All lubricating nipples of the machine can be filled with a universal grease type.\" So the answer is that the recommended type is \"universal grease type.\" But the user might be expecting a specific type, but the context doesn't mention it. Therefore, the answer is \"universal grease type\" as per the context. However, the answer format requires an exact answer.

The user is asking about the valve type and manufacturer that comes with the hopper empty sensor's valve set.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The relevant section is on page 148 under the \"Accessories\" section, specifically the part about the hopper empty sensor. The text says, \"The sensor usually comes with the valve set.\" \n\nWait, but the question is about the valve type and manufacturer. However, in the context provided, there's no mention of the specific valve type or the manufacturer. The context only states that the valve set comes with the sensor but doesn't specify what type of valve it is or who manufactures it. \n\nI should check if there's any other part of the context that might mention this. Looking through the rest of the pages, the other accessories like hopper extensions, covers, and the pellet sieve are discussed, but nothing about the valve type or manufacturer. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide details on the valve's type or manufacturer, the correct answer would be that this information isn't found in the context. The user might have expected the answer to be there, but based on the given text, it's not present. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

I need to check the provided context to find this information.\n\nLooking through the context, on Page 149, there's a mention of a drain kit being available for quickly emptying the hopper. However, the text doesn't specify any numerical values related to the drain rate. The technical specifications on Page 150 talk about the hopper's capacity in liters (like 1875, 2550, etc.), but those are about the hopper's volume, not the drain rate. There's also information about the filling level and width, but nothing about how fast the drain kit empties the hopper. \n\nSince the context doesn't mention liters per minute or any rate related to the drain kit's performance, the answer should be that the information isn't found. The user might have assumed the drain kit's rate is related to the hopper's capacity, but without explicit data, I can't infer it. The correct response here is to state that it's not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The text says, \"The hopper cover protects the fertiliser in the hopper against humidity and dirt.\" Then there's a part about the electric hopper cover, but no material is specified there. \n\nWait, there's a mention of a \"sail\" in the context: \"The sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening.\" But the material of the sail isn't directly stated. The context talks about the hopper cover being made of certain parts like long sides, short sides, corner parts, etc., but those are structural parts, not the sail material. \n\nThe question specifically asks about the 'sail' material. The context doesn't mention any material for the sail. It only mentions that the hopper cover is made of various components, but the sail's material isn't specified. Also, there's no information about UV resistance. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide details on the sail's material or UV resistance, the correct answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions.
