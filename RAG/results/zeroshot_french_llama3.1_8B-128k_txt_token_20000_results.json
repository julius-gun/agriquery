However, based on the context, I can infer that the material is likely a plastic or rubberized material to protect against UV (ultraviolet) degradation.\n\nThe text mentions \"huile et graisse\" which means oil and grease in French, but it's not clear if this refers to the material of the hopper cover. However, later on, it mentions \"caoutchouc\", which is a type of plastic or rubberized material used for seals and gaskets.\n\nTherefore, I will provide an answer based on these hints:\n\nThe material used for the hopper cover is likely a plastic or rubberized material with UV resistance.\n</answer>",
