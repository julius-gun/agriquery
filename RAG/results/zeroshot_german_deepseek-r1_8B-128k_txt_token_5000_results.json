It mentions that in this mode, two of the three dosing openings are closed. This is done to allow a precise flow even when dealing with small doses, preventing blockages and ensuring accurate distribution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, during fine application, exactly two dosing openings are closed.\n</think>\n\nDuring fine application, 2 out of 3 dosing openings are closed.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at Page 23, it mentions that the machine is designed for spreading corn-based fertilizers in agriculture and vineyard husbandry. It talks about attaching to a keel of the previous equipment, software like CenterFlow Streusystem, and how it's fixed either at the three-point hitch of the tractor (Category II), with a intermediate block (accessory) for tractors with power lift (Category III), or using a provided wheel set.\n\nMoving on to Page 24, it discusses precise settings for dosage. It mentions that each dosing unit has two control levers for adjusting dose and working width independently. It also explains how the machine can close up to two of three dosing openings to prevent clogging while maintaining the desired dose.\n\nPage 25 talks about the GEOSPREAD system's combined control, including a disk setting for the discharge opening. It mentions that the shape of the spread pattern is determined by the width distribution. The discharge opening significantly affects the spread pattern. There are two additional controls for adjusting the discharge opening based on fertilizer type and discharge speed.\n\nPage 26 shows an image of the main display showing active sections, which are black triangles indicating active segments. It also mentions that the working width is split into sections controlled by GEOCONTROL. The main display shows how each section is active or inactive, affecting the spread pattern.\n\nPage 27 discusses RATE Control and MULTIRATE functions, which adjust dosage based on external signals. It explains that the system can handle up to 8 VRA sections for variable rate application.\n\nPage 28 talks about the GEOSPREAD function's impact on border spreading using a border blanking plate or hydraulic border blanking device. It mentions that by reducing the working width during operations, the spread pattern transitions from a trapezoidal shape to a triangular one with full overlap.\n\nPage 29 introduces ExactLine for precise border application. It explains that ExactLine diverts part of the spread pattern to the edge, minimizing waste beyond the field boundary.\n\nPage 30 discusses the ISO-Schlepper system, mentioning that it uses ISOBUS communication for optimal control and data transfer between the tractor and machine. It also notes that GPS and sensors are used for precise application based on field conditions.\n\nPage 31 covers aspects of the machine's operation, including automatic calibration and reference sensors to correct for factors like slopes or shaking.\n\nPage 32 details the Bedienpult (operator console), emphasizing the use of IsoMatch terminals for ISOBUS communication. It mentions that the system can handle up to 8 VRA sections for variable rate application.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about overlap percentage for full field spreading. From Page 28, it says that for most fertilizer types, the spread pattern is a triangular shape with full overlap (100% overlap). This is achieved when the working width is set appropriately and the discharge opening is adjusted correctly using the GEOSPREAD system.\n\nSo, the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is 100%.\n</think>\n\nThe overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is **100%**.",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several pages discussing different aspects of a machine's operation. On page 25, it mentions \"Breiteverteilung mit GEOSPREAD\" which translates to something like \"Broad distribution with GEOSPREAD.\" It talks about stellgliedern (controls) for adjusting the outflow opening and how the system uses GPS and data from spread jobs to determine when to close or open parts of the machine.\n\nOn page 26, it continues discussing the GEOSPREAD system, mentioning that it's used for controlling the spread pattern. It also refers to a \"Streubildkontrolle (Streumengentest)\" on page 76, which I think is about testing the spread pattern. But since the question is about continuous measurement, this might not be directly relevant.\n\nPage 27 talks about RATE Control and MULTIRATE systems. RATE Control seems to adjust the dosage based on external signals, but it's more about variable rates rather than continuous measurement of quantity spread.\n\nPage 30 discusses the ISO-Schlepper (tractor) with ISOBUS communication. It mentions that the tractor uses sensors to measure the amount of fertilizer being spread and adjusts the dosier accordingly. Specifically, it says the computer in the distributor compares the measured value with the set dosage and corrects it if necessary.\n\nPage 31 goes into more detail about how the system calculates needed outflow speed based on factors like working width and speed. It also mentions automatic recalibration to ensure accuracy, especially when the amount of fertilizer is less than 100 kg.\n\nPutting this together, the key systems involved are the GEOSPREAD system for controlling the spread pattern and the ISO-Schlepper's ISOBUS communication which uses sensors to measure and adjust the fertilizer quantity continuously. The computer in the distributor monitors and corrects the dosage based on real-time data from the sensors.\n</think>\n\nThe system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread is the **GEOSPREAD system**, which adjusts the spread pattern using GPS and data from previous jobs, ensuring accurate distribution.\n\n**Answer:** The GEOSPREAD system continuously measures and adjusts the fertilizer quantity being spread.",

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each page mentioned in the context to see if there's any mention of calibration tests for the spreader.\n\nStarting with Page 26: It talks about displaying active sections on the main display and some adjustments for dosing settings. Doesn't seem relevant.\n\nPage 27 discusses RATE Control and mentions that it's a variable dose controlled by an external signal, but nothing about calibration tests here either.\n\nMoving to Page 28: This page is about different spreader forms like flat spreading and edge spreading with the ExactLine. No mention of calibration tests.\n\nPage 29: Focuses on the ExactLine for reducing waste at field edges. Again, no info on calibration.\n\nPage 30: Talks about the ISOBediensystem (operator interface) and automatic weighing system. It mentions that the computer corrects dosing based on weight measurements compared to set dosage. It also says that for each application, the computer uses data from the spreader table and automatic tests every 75 kg or minute to determine the right settings. This seems relevant because it's about automatic testing.\n\nPage 31: Discusses how the required outflow speed is calculated using a formula involving work width, speed, and application rate. It also mentions that the computer uses data from the spreader table and runs automatic tests every 75 kg or minute to correct dosing. This reinforces what was in Page 30.\n\nPage 32: Focuses on the ISOBUS connection and how it communicates with the machine. No calibration info here.\n\nPage 33-35: These pages are about the operator interface, bedienpult, and technical data. No mention of calibration tests.\n\nSo, from Pages 30 and 31, I see that the spreader performs automatic calibration tests every time there's a change in dosage or application rate.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFrom Page 32, I see that ISOBUS is used for communication between the tractor and the terminal. If the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, it might still be able to connect using an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz. This setup allows the tractor to become fully ISOBUS-gerüstet, enabling it to communicate with the IsoMatch Bedienpult.\n\nOn Page 33, it mentions that the IsoMatch Tellus GO is a compact version of the terminal and can handle all necessary functions. It also talks about using an 'In Cab' Kabel for connecting the tractor to the IsoMatch terminal if the tractor already has ISOBUS. However, since the question is about tractors without ISOBUS, I need to look elsewhere.\n\nLooking at Page 32 again, it says that if a non-ISOBUS tractor uses the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz, it can be connected. This means the tractor isn't using ISOBUS directly but is instead using an adapter to communicate via IsoMatch. So, even without ISOBUS, the tractor can still send speed data through this alternative method.\n\nTherefore, the answer should explain that the tractor can connect to IsoMatch using a Stromversorgungskabelsatz, allowing the speed to be transmitted without needing ISOBUS.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor can connect to IsoMatch using an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz, enabling communication and transmission of driving speed even without ISOBUS.",

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the pages mentioned in the context. The user provided text from pages 30 to 38. Each page seems to cover different aspects of the machine's operation and components.\n\nStarting with page 30, it talks about the automatic weighing system and ISO-Bedienpult. It mentions that the control box is part of the Schlepper, which is a type of agricultural machinery used for spreading fertilizers or seeds. The page also discusses how the control box communicates via ISOBUS and uses software for dosing correction.\n\nMoving to page 31, it's about the speed settings and automatic probe functions. It mentions that the computer calculates the required outflow speed using specific formulas. There's a mention of the Streutabelle (spread table) and how the system corrects dosing based on tests every 75 kg or minute. This seems more technical but doesn't directly point to the location of the main switch.\n\nPage 32 discusses the ISO-Schlepper, ISOBUS communication, and GPS integration. It talks about connecting the Schlepper to the control box via ISOBUS and using a terminal for operation. There's also information on optional accessories like the IsoMatch Griff (hand grip) which allows central control of functions.\n\nPage 33 is about the Bedienpult (operator console). It describes the features of the IsoMatch Tellus GO, including its compact design and additional functions like GPS. The page emphasizes that it's a hand-held terminal used for ISO-Steuerung.\n\nPage 34 details the technical specifications of the Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD model, listing dimensions, weights, and other components. It doesn't directly mention the switch location but provides info on the machine's capabilities.\n\nPage 35 discusses the optional IsoMatch Griff, which allows central control from a hand grip. It mentions that this device has 11 function buttons and an additional button with the thumb for more functions. This seems relevant because it's about how the operator interacts with the control system.\n\nPage 36 lists technical data including engine power, noise levels, and other specifications. No direct info on switch location here.\n\nPage 37 talks about pre-use checks and maintenance procedures. It mentions controlling the machine's components but doesn't specify where the main switch is located.\n\nPutting this together, the context describes various parts of the control system, including terminals, hand grips, and consoles. The IsoMatch Griff (page 35) seems to be a central control unit that an operator can use from a hand grip. This suggests that the main switch might be part of this hand-held device or integrated into it.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if the main switch is part of the hand grip itself or located elsewhere, like in the Bedienpult or another component. The context doesn't explicitly state where the main switch button is located but provides details about different control units.\n\nGiven that the IsoMatch Griff allows central control from a hand grip, it's possible that the main switch is integrated into this unit. Alternatively, the main switch might be part of the Bedienpult or another component not directly mentioned in the provided context.\n\nSince the question asks specifically for the location of the main switch button, and based on the information given, the most precise answer I can extract is that it's located on the IsoMatch Griff, which serves as a central control unit. Therefore, the main switch button is part of this hand-held device.\n</think>\n\nThe main switch button to turn the control box on or off is located on the **IsoMatch Griff**, which acts as a central control unit.",

Then, it talks about connecting the position sensor to the control box on the streuer.\n\nWait, the question is specifically about where to connect the position sensor for the hydraulic border spreading plate. From the context, I see that after mounting the frame and the lamellar boxes, the next step is to attach the position sensor to the control box on the streuer. That makes sense because the sensor needs to be connected to the machine's electronics to provide feedback.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the position sensor should be connected to the control box of the streuer after the hydraulic border spreading plate is mounted.\n</think>\n\nThe position sensor for the hydraulic border spreading plate should be connected to the control box on the streuer. \n\n**Answer:** The position sensor should be connected to the control box of the streuer.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at page 50, there's a section about \"Gelenkwelle montieren\" which translates to mounting the joint. It mentions that the provided joint is usually too long for most types of tractors. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted before attaching it to the tractor.\n\nOn page 51, under \"Gelenkwelle kürzen,\" it explains how to shorten the joint. The key points are ensuring enough overlap between the profiles and maintaining a minimum of 150 mm overlap while having at least 25 mm play. This is crucial because if the joint is too long or not adjusted properly, it can cause severe damage to both the machine and the tractor.\n\nAdditionally, on page 52, when discussing \"Unterlenkeranschluss wählen,\" it's mentioned that the machine should be placed on a stable stand to prevent accidents. However, this seems more about overall stability rather than specifically checking the coupling shaft length.\n\nGoing back to pages 50-51, the main precaution is adjusting the joint length correctly. If not done properly, it can lead to issues like the machine tipping over or parts getting damaged. So, the specific precaution is ensuring the joint is the correct length by shortening it if necessary before use.\n</think>\n\nBefore working between the tractor and machine to check the coupling shaft length, ensure that the joint has been correctly adjusted by shortening it as needed to maintain a minimum overlap of 150 mm with at least 25 mm play.

It seems to be a set of instructions for operating machinery, specifically related to a device called ExactLine used in agriculture.\n\nI remember that PTO stands for Power Take-Off, which is a component in tractors and other machinery that engages the power source to drive attachments or implements. Disengaging the PTO would mean shutting it off or disconnecting it from whatever it's powering.\n\nLooking through the context, I see sections about safety procedures. One part mentions: \"Before leaving the machine, you must...\" and lists several steps including turning off the PTO shaft. Another section talks about the dangers of having the PTO engaged while working on the machine because someone could be injured if the machine starts moving.\n\nSo, after disengaging the PTO, the continued danger would be that the machine might still have power or movement unless all safety measures are taken. Specifically, the context warns against leaving the machine in a state where it can be accidentally started while someone is working on it.

It mentions that when the application rate is very low (less than 25 kg/ha), the system can't perform automatic calibration. Instead, they recommend using the Feindosier-Set. This set uses only one of the three dosing openings, which means each opening needs to be larger to compensate for the lower dose.\n\nThe context also explains that by closing two of the three dosing openings, the remaining one must be opened wider. Specifically, it says that the required throughput (Durchsatz) is three times higher when using Feindosier-Set because only one dosing opening is open.

Then, moving to page 65, it discusses adjusting the discharge opening correctly to ensure proper spreading. It mentions that the correct position of the discharge opening is crucial along with the settings of the joint and gear speed.\n\nPage 66 explains about dosing options, mentioning that the system can apply doses in three different ways: automatic calibration, Feindosier set for small doses, and manual control. Page 67 goes into detail about the Feindosier set, which involves closing two out of three dosage openings to prevent blockages.\n\nPage 68 discusses how to determine the correct dosage setting by reading from the table, especially when the desired dose isn't listed, using the nearest available option. It also talks about calculating the required discharge rate and adjusting the discharge opening accordingly.\n\nLooking at page 69, there's a specific example with a Streutabelle (fertilizer table) for Schneckenkörner. The table shows different settings for dosage, discharge openings, and rates. For instance, in row 7, it mentions \"D\" as the discharge position.\n\nPage 70 continues with another example, Nutramon, where they mention setting the discharge opening to \"J\". It also explains how to calculate the required discharge rate and adjust the dosage accordingly.\n\nNow, focusing on the question: What is the symbol on top of the fine application handle indicating that the Fine application kit is enabled? \n\nFrom the context, I see that when using the Feindosier set (Fine application), two out of three dosage openings are closed. The symbol for this setup would likely be an indicator that shows which dosage openings are active. In page 67, it mentions that the Feindosierhebel (handle) has markings indicating how many openings are open or closed.\n\nThe key part is that when using Feindosieren (Fine application), only one of the three dosage openings is open. The symbol would show this state, probably with a specific marker or color coding on the handle. Since the exact symbol isn't described in detail, but the context mentions that two are closed and one is open for Feindosieren, I can infer that the symbol indicates which application kit is active.\n\nTherefore, the symbol likely shows that the Fine application kit is enabled by indicating the specific dosage openings used.\n</think>\n\nThe symbol on top of the fine application handle indicates that the Fine application kit is enabled by displaying the specific dosage openings (e.g., one open and two closed) used for precise application.",

Hmm, not sure if this is directly relevant.\n\nMoving on to page 87, it talks about the maximum loss in the ditch being set by environmental norms. It specifically mentions that in the first catch basin along the fictional ditch (the one in the middle of the driving path), the amount of fertilizer can't exceed 10% of the capacity of the middle trough.

This is during the preparation for storage, so the goal is to secure the machine properly.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections related to maintenance and storage. On page 120, under \"Außerbetriebnahme\" (which translates to out-of-service operation or decommissioning), it discusses how to safely disconnect the machine. One part mentions that if the power lift can't be lowered enough, a tip is given: place the Streuer on a stable, elevated platform, like a palette. This allows the power lift to extend further without risking damage or injury.\n\nSo, the solution suggested is to use an external structure to give the machine more space. The user should move the Streuer (probably a loader or similar equipment) onto a sturdy platform, which in turn allows the power lift to be lowered fully. This prevents any issues with the catch hooks and ensures safe handling during storage.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing anything else.

The numbers provided are in columns, and I need to identify which one corresponds to the hopper weight without the cover.\n\nLooking at the headers:\n0: Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD\n1: Behälterinhalt (l) - this is the capacity in liters.\n2: Füllhöhe (cm)\n3: Füllbreite (cm)\n4: Behälterbreite (cm)\n5: Eigengewicht (kg)\n6: Maximale Zuladung (kg)\n7: Typ Unterlenkeranschluss\n8: Maximales Gesamtgewicht (kg)\n9: Behältergewicht\n\nSo, line 10 is \"Behältergewicht\" without the cover. The numbers listed for this are:\n10: Ohne Abdeckplane (kg): 277.5, 307.5, 337.5, 367.5\n11: Mit Abdeckplane (kg): 324.5, 354.5, 384.5, 414.5\n\nSince the question asks for \"without hopper cover,\" I should look at line 10. The first model number corresponds to 0, so the first data point is for 1875 l, which isn't our case here.\n\nLooking for the 3225 model:\nOn line 12: Mit elektrischer Abdeckplane (kg): 365, 395, 425\nBut wait, that's with an electric cover. The question is about without the cover, so I need to check line 10 again.\n\nFor the 3225 model, line 10 is 367.5 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper weight without the hopper cover for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 is **367.5 kg**.",

Under this, I see several lines with numbers and labels.\n\nLooking closer, line number 1 says \"Behälterinhalt (l) 1875 2550 3225 3900\". The term \"Behälterinhalt\" probably means something like container capacity or volume. Since the question is about weight in kg, I need to find a line that refers to weight.\n\nContinuing down, line number 5 says \"Eigengewicht (kg) 705 735 765 795\". The term here is \"Eigengewicht\", which means self-weight or the machine's own weight. This seems relevant because it directly mentions weight in kilograms.\n\nSo, for each model variant, including the 3900, the Eigengewicht is given as 795 kg.

Let me start by understanding what \"vanes\" refer to in this context. From the context provided, it seems like the vanes are part of a machine, possibly agricultural or construction equipment, given the mention of things like \"Kraftheber,\" which I think is a type of excavator or loader.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see that there's a section on Wartung (Maintenance) starting from page 122. On page 125, it lists various maintenance intervals with numbers and what each interval corresponds to. The user's question is about the inspection frequency of the vanes, so I need to find where in the context this specific task is mentioned.\n\nI'll go through each relevant section. Page 124 talks about oil and grease volumes, which isn't directly related. Page 125 lists Wartungsintervalle (maintenance intervals). Each interval is numbered from 0 to 20, with corresponding tasks. Let me check each one:\n\n- 0: Kontrolle von Schrauben und Muttern (Control of bolts and nuts)\n- 1: Kontrolle Hydrauliksystem (Hydraulic system control)\n- 2: Zustand Rührer und Rührerwelle (Condition of rotor and rotor shaft)\n- 3: Zustand Schaufeln (Condition of shovels)\n- 4: Kontrolle und Einstellung Dosiermechanismus (Control and adjustment of dosage mechanism)\n- 5: Kontrolle und Einstellung Einstellmechanismus Auslauföffnung (Control and adjustment of outlet adjustment mechanism)\n- 6: Kontrolle und Einstellung Höhe Auslaufrohr (Control and adjustment of outlet pipe height)\n- 7: Zustand der Abdichtung der Zylinder (Condition of cylinder seals)\n- 8: Schmieren (Greasing)\n- 9: Profilrohre Gelenkwelle (Profile pipes of the joint shaft)\n- 10: 4 Schmiernippel der Zapfwelle (4 grease nipples of the transmission)\n- 11: 2 Schmiernippel auf beide Auslassdosen (2 grease nipples on both discharge pipes)\n- 12: 1 Schmiernippel auf allen vier Stellgliedern (1 grease nipple on all four control arms)\n- 13: Fett anbringen oder beifüllen (Adding or refilling grease)\n- 14: Profilrohre Gelenkwellen (Profile pipes of the joint shaft)\n- 15: Zentralgetriebe (Central gears)\n- 16: Getriebe der Streuscheiben (Gears of the sprocket wheels)\n- 17: Öl anbringen (Oil addition)\n- 18: Kupplungsstücke in Antrieb Streuscheiben (Coupling pieces in drive sprockets)\n- 19: Austauschen (Replacement)\n- 20: Hydraulikschläuche und Kupplungsstücke (Hydraulic hoses and coupling pieces)\n\nI don't see a specific mention of vanes here. Maybe \"vanes\" refer to something else, like the blades or parts that move in a rotational manner. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to the control arms or similar components.\n\nWait, on page 126, there's a section about Schmierpunkte (grease points), specifically mentioning Stellglieder (control arms). It says \"Die Stellglieder sind mit 1 Schmiernippel versehen\" which translates to \"The control arms are equipped with 1 grease nipple.\" So, the vanes might be referring to these control arms.\n\nLooking back at page 125, interval 12 is about the control arms: \"1 Schmiernippel auf allen vier Stellgliedern\" (1 grease nipple on all four control arms). This suggests that the condition of the control arms (which could be considered vanes) should be checked every 100 standing hours.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the condition of the vanes must be inspected at an interval of 100 standing hours.\n</think>\n\nThe condition of the vanes must be inspected at an interval of **100 standing hours**.",

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of \"bushing height\" or related terms like \"height adjustment\" in the context. Scanning through the pages, on page 125 there's a section titled \"Wartungsintervalle,\" which translates to \"Wartung Intervals.\" This seems relevant because it lists various maintenance tasks with their intervals.\n\nLooking closer at page 125, I see a list of numbers and what they correspond to. The first entry is number 0: \"Kontrollieren\" which means \"Check.\" It's followed by \"Kontrolle von Schrauben und Muttern,\" meaning \"Control of screws and nuts.\" But then, moving down the list, I notice that at number 10, it says \"4 Schmiernippel der Zapfwelle,\" which is about checking the oil plugs on the gearbox. However, this isn't directly about bushing height.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other pages. On page 126, there's a section about \"Schmierpunkte\" or \"Lubrication points.\" It mentions the gelenkwelle (gearing) and schmiernippel (oil plugs). But again, not directly about bushing height.\n\nGoing back to page 125, perhaps I misread. The list starts at 0 with Kontrollieren, then each subsequent number corresponds to a specific task. Number 10 is \"4 Schmiernippel der Zapfwelle,\" which are the oil plugs on the gearbox. So maybe the bushing height isn't directly listed here.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the term \"bushing\" refers to something else in German machinery, like a housing or bearing component. Maybe it's referred to differently. Let me check if there's any mention of adjusting heights or discharge settings elsewhere.\n\nLooking at page 127, which discusses \"Fett anbringen/beifüllen,\" meaning \"Applying grease.\" It talks about the profile rails on the gear transmission and how often to grease them. But still not directly about the bushing height.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look for terms like \"Abstand\" (distance) or \"Höhe\" (height). On page 125, under number 10, it's about oil plugs, but maybe the context is that after checking these, the discharge is set. Or perhaps the setting of the discharge relates to the bushing height.\n\nWait, in the question, it's about checking the bushing height and setting the discharge. Maybe the interval for this specific task isn't explicitly stated, or it's combined with other tasks.\n\nLooking again at page 125: The intervals are given as numbers, each corresponding to a specific control or maintenance task. Number 10 is about oil plugs on the gearbox. So perhaps the bushing height and discharge setting are part of another interval not listed here, or maybe they're included in the general maintenance.\n\nAlternatively, if I can't find an exact interval for this specific task, I might have to respond that it's unknown based on the context provided.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not explicitly provide information about the interval for checking the bushing height and setting the discharge. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**Unknown**",

On page 125, item 21 is \"Abdichtung Rührerwelle,\" which translates to \"Seal of the stir ring.\" The description says \"Kontrolle und Einstellung\" (Control and adjustment), but it doesn't specify the interval for replacement.\n\nLooking further, on page 126, there's a section about Schmierpunkte (lubrication points) including the Gelenkwelle (axle) and Auslaufrohre (discharge pipes). It mentions controlling the condition of the seal. However, again, no specific interval is given for replacement.\n\nOn page 127, it talks about adding grease to the profile rails of the axle. Still, nothing about replacing the seal itself.\n\nPage 128 discusses oiling of coupling components but doesn't mention seals.\n\nPage 129 and 130 talk about torque specifications for bolts and nuts, which isn't relevant here.\n\nSo, in all the provided pages, there's no specific interval given for when to replace the agitator seal. The closest is item 21 on page 125, which mentions controlling the seal's condition but doesn't specify how often it should be replaced.\n\nTherefore, based on the context, I can't find a specific maintenance interval for replacing the agitator seal.\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

But in this case, since it's about bolting, I think the key factor here is the bolt's tension and the friction between the bolt and the hole it's being fastened into.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are tables on pages 129 and 130 that list torque values for different bolts and nuts. Page 129 talks about Anzugsmomente (which translates to torque) for various types of bolts and nuts, including M6. It also mentions a table with coefficients based on materials and friction.\n\nOn page 130, specifically, there's a detailed table for M6 bolts with different qualities. The quality mentioned here is 70 (A2), which matches the question. The table provides torque values for different friction coefficients. For example, at 0.10 friction, it's 6.3 Nm, and at 0.20 friction, it's 9.9 Nm.\n\nSince the question specifies a 0.2 friction coefficient, I should look for that in the context. Page 130 shows that for M6 bolts with 70 (A2) quality and a 0.20 friction coefficient, the required torque is 9.9 Nm. \n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. The tables on pages 129 and 130 both discuss M6 bolts, so cross-referencing confirms that 9.9 Nm is correct for the given parameters.\n\nTherefore, the precise answer should be exactly 9.9 Nm.\n</think>\n\nThe required torque to fasten an M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient is **9.9 Nm**.\n\n**Answer:** 9.9 Nm",

Page 20 discusses safe driving habits, controlling speed based on terrain, and avoiding sharp curves. It also mentions not leaving the driver's seat during transport, which could be relevant for fuel efficiency if the tractor is moving without someone monitoring.\n\nPage 21 covers maintenance and safety again, emphasizing regular inspections and not operating the machine in enclosed spaces to prevent carbon monoxide issues. Page 22 warns about explosive dangers with nitrate fertilizers and the need to handle them properly. Page 23 starts getting into the specifics of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD system, mentioning it's a centrifugal spreader with two plates that distribute the fertilizer horizontally.\n\nPage 24 goes into depth about the dosing system, explaining how the machine can be set for precise dosage and how it adjusts based on factors like the type of fertilizer. It also mentions that the dosage can be controlled independently from the speed, which might affect fuel consumption. Page 25 talks about the width distribution using GEOSPREAD software, controlling the spread pattern and adjusting the working width during operations.\n\nPage 26 discusses the display screens used for monitoring the active sections being spread, which could help in optimizing the spreading pattern and thus potentially diesel use. It also mentions that changing dosages or fertilizer types can be done by adjusting settings on the main screen.\n\nNow, focusing specifically on the question about extra diesel consumption when using Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. The context doesn't directly provide figures or percentages for fuel efficiency with this specific system. However, it does mention that the machine is designed to distribute materials efficiently, which might imply that it's optimized for fuel use.\n\nSince there are no exact numbers provided in the context, I should respond by stating that the information isn't available.

The idea here is that this setup allows for a more precise and reliable flow of fertilizer, especially when dealing with small doses. It also mentions that this configuration helps prevent blockages and ensures consistent distribution.\n\nNow, considering the question about cost, I need to determine if fine application (which seems to be a precise method) costs more than normal dosing.

Let me start by understanding what one-sided boundary spreading means. From the context provided, it seems like this technique involves using a machine to spread fertilizer or seeds in such a way that it covers only one side of a field or garden plot.\n\nLooking through the context, I see mentions of ExactLine and how it's used for grenzstreuen, which translates to boundary spreading. The ExactLine is described as a system that helps minimize the loss of material over the edge of the field by guiding the distribution in a specific way. It allows for precise control so that the fertilizer or seeds are spread effectively without too much waste beyond the garden's boundaries.\n\nThe context also talks about how this method can be adjusted with settings like 'Umweltstellung' and 'Ertragsstellung,' which I think relate to environmental and yield considerations. This suggests that it's designed for efficient use, which is important for smaller areas where precision is key.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that one-sided spreading is possible by using certain functions in the GEOSPREAD system, such as closing two of three dosing openings. This precise control would be beneficial in small gardens to avoid overuse or waste.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that one-sided boundary spreading with systems like ExactLine is indeed suitable for small gardens because it allows for efficient and controlled application without excessive material loss beyond the garden's edges.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens as it allows precise control to minimize material loss while effectively covering the area.",

The key points here are:\n\n1. Close the Dosier units.\n2. Turn off the Zapfwell (hydraulic motor).\n3. Shut down the electronic control system.\n4. Stop the engine, remove the ignition key from the starter lock, and engage the parking brake.\n\nThese seem like the primary measures for safely stopping work on the road.

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several pages discussing the use of ExactLine for spreading fertilizers on fields. Page 114 mentions that many kinds of fertilizer can form crusts or blocks when they become wet. This happens especially if the fertilizer isn't spread properly or if it's left in a damp environment. The crusty layer blocks the flow, causing clogs and issues with machinery.\n\nPage 115 also talks about how wet fertilizer can create these blocks, which can stop the flow through dosing openings. It suggests that if the fertilizer is kept dry and the equipment is well-maintained, this problem can be minimized. Additionally, it advises against leaving wet fertilizer in the spreader for long periods because it can form these blocking layers.\n\nSo, putting this together, the main reason seems to be that when fertilizer absorbs water, it forms a crusty layer which blocks movement and causes clogs. This is why it's important to handle wet fertilizer carefully and ensure machinery is set up to prevent blockages.\n</think>\n\nMost types of fertiliser attract water because they can form a crusty or blocked layer when wet, obstructing the flow and causing machinery issues.",

It lists possible causes of issues with the machine. One of them is \"a hard object blocks the shovel\" or \"a hard object or large block of fertilizer blocks partially the intake of fertilizer to the shovel.\" This suggests that when a hard object gets stuck, it can cause damage.\n\nFurther down on page 115, under Schaden (Damage), it mentions that if the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing are damaged, it's likely due to a hard object blocking. It says to check for blocked intake openings and use tools like a screwdriver to see if something is stuck inside.\n\nSo putting this together, when a hard object blocks parts of the machine, especially in areas where material is being spread, it can cause mechanical damage because the machine keeps trying to move the blockage, leading to wear and tear or breakage.\n</think>\n\nDamage to the vanes, spreading disc, or discharge bushing is most likely caused by a hard object blocking their function. When such an obstruction occurs, the machine's mechanisms attempt to compensate, leading to excessive strain and potential damage.\n\n**Answer:** Damage is likely caused by a hard object blocking the components, as the machine's operation becomes strained trying to compensate for the blockage.",

On page 117, it mentions that during the exteriorization of the machine, one might come into contact with chemicals like fertilizer and other agents which can cause injuries. It advises wearing protective clothing such as gloves and boots, following the manufacturer's safety instructions, and avoiding contact unless necessary.\n\nFurther down on page 118, under \"Reinigung\" (which translates to Cleaning), it says that before setting the machine out of service for a period, especially during winter storage, the machine should be cleaned. It also mentions using specific conservation agents to protect against corrosion. However, this seems more about maintaining the machine rather than an immediate response to someone who has fallen into fertilizer.\n\nOn page 119, under \"Abkoppeln der Maschine\" (Coupling the Machine), it again emphasizes wearing protective gear and avoiding contact with chemicals. But again, this is about operating the machinery safely, not about what to do after falling into fertilizer.\n\nLooking at page 117 specifically, there's a section titled \"Vermeiden Sie den Kontakt mit Kunstdünger und anderen Mitteln\" (Avoid Contact with Fertilizer and Other Agents), which states that during maintenance or exteriorization, one might come into contact with these substances. It advises wearing protective clothing and following safety guidelines from the supplier.\n\nSo, putting this together, if someone falls into fertilizer and a doctor isn't available, the immediate steps would be to remove themselves from the area, take off any contaminated clothing, wash thoroughly, and seek medical attention as soon as possible.

The reason given is to prevent Schmutz (dirt), Kunstdünger (fertilizer), and water from getting into the storage areas. If the grease nipples aren't lubricated, these substances could enter and cause issues.\n\nFurther down on page 118, under Reinigung (Cleaning), it says that after cleaning, the machine should be greased again to conserve. This reinforces the idea that not greasing can lead to contamination.\n\nOn page 117, there's a warning about using a high-pressure cleaner without pointing the nozzle at certain parts like dichtungen and Entlüftungsverschlüsse (seals and ventilation openings). If these aren't protected, Schmutz und Wasser could get in. This implies that without proper lubrication, these areas might be more susceptible.\n\nAdditionally, on page 122, it's mentioned to repair any damage immediately.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the pages provided, I see that there's a lot of technical information about hydraulic systems, couplings, and maintenance procedures. The question specifically asks about the grease type for the profiled tubes in the coupling shaft.\n\nOn page 51, there's an instruction about the Gelenkwelle (gelenkwellen), which translates to the coupling shaft. It mentions that the Profilrohre (profiled tubes) should have a minimum overlap of 150 mm and at least 25 mm of play. The process involves cutting the tubes to maintain this overlap.\n\nFurther down on page 51, it says: \"Die Sicherungsketten der Schutzrohre anbringen\" which translates to installing safety chains on the protective tubes. This is important because if the protective tubes move, they could cause issues or injuries.\n\nOn page 52, under Schlepperanbau (implement attachment), there's a mention of securing bedienorgane (controls) and ensuring that parts like cylinders are positioned so they don't get accidentally activated. However, this doesn't directly relate to grease type.\n\nLooking at page 54, it again discusses the Gelenkwelle and mentions installing safety chains on the protective tubes. It also talks about checking for wear or damage before operation.\n\nNowhere in the context do I see a specific recommendation for the type of grease. The focus is more on maintaining the correct length and installation of the coupling shaft's profiled tubes, ensuring they don't cause issues like excessive wear or movement.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of grease types, I can only conclude that the context doesn't provide this information. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nThe context provided does not specify a recommended grease type for the profiled tubes of the coupling shaft. \n\n**Answer:** Not found in context.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at page 69, there's a section titled \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen\" which translates to \"Work before spreading.\" Under this, it says:\n\n✵ Angenommen, Sie möchten Nutramon aus dem Beispiel verstreuen, mit den Eigenschaften, wie sie in der Streutabelle auf dieser Seite angegeben sind:\nBei einer Arbeitsbreite von 27 Metern, einer Fahrgeschwindigkeit von 8 km/h und einer gewünschten Dosis von 25 kg/ha.\nDie gesuchte Dosis fällt außerhalb des Bereichs der Streutabelle.\n\nSo this part is about spreading Nutramon, which is an example. The desired dosage of 25 kg/ha isn't in the table, so they have to calculate it.\n\nFurther down on page 69, under \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen,\" there's a table with various entries. Each row has columns for kg/min and other values. For example:\n\n- In row 0: 6+0, 0,21, C, 0,54, etc.\n- Row 1: 6+1, 0,32, C, 0,83...\n- And so on up to row 7.\n\nBut the key part is that in the example where they're using Nutramon, they mention \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" as one of the options. Specifically, when they refer to the spreading chart example, they use \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" with certain parameters.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the context on page 69 starts with an example about Nutramon, not Delicia. So maybe I need to look elsewhere for the specific type used in the example.\n\nLooking back at the beginning of the context, under \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen\" on page 67 and 68, there's a mention of Feindosierung (fein dosing) and using the Feindosier-Set. But that might not be directly related to Delicia Schnecken Linsen.\n\nOn page 69, the example starts with \"Schneckenkörner\" which translates to slug pellets, specifically mentioning \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen.\" The table shows different rows with various settings. For instance, row 7 is labeled as 12+3 and has a kg/min value of 3,7.\n\nWait, but the question is about the specific type used in the spreading chart example. In the context provided, the example on page 69 uses \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" with parameters like Arbeitsbreite (width) of 12 meters, Fahrgeschwindigkeit (speed) of 8 km/h, and a desired dosage of 23 kg/ha. The corresponding Auslassgeschwindigkeit (outflow speed) is calculated as 3,7 kg/min.\n\nSo the specific type used in the example is \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" with the settings for that particular row.\n</think>\n\nThe specific type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' slug pellets used in the spreading chart example corresponds to the entry labeled as \"12+3\" with an associated kg/min value of 3.7.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe specific type used is \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" with the settings for row 7, which has a kg/min value of 3.7.",

Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. Baud rate refers to how many signal changes or symbols a communication channel can handle per second. In RS-232, this is crucial for data transmission speed.\n\nLooking through the context, I see that Page 72 discusses the RS-232 connection. It mentions that the system uses an RS-232 serial link for communication between the external system and the steersystem. The exact sentence is: \"Sie kommunizieren untereinander über einen seriellen Anschluss (sogenannte RS 232-Verbindung).\" This translates to them communicating via a serial connection, specifically RS-232.\n\nI recall that RS-232 typically operates at standard baud rates like 1200, 2400, or 4800. These are common because they're widely supported by hardware and software. The context doesn't specify any non-standard rates, so I should assume the standard ones unless stated otherwise.\n\nSince the question asks for the minimum baud rate, I need to determine which is the lowest commonly used. 1200 baud is the slowest among the standard rates. There's no indication in the provided text that a lower rate is used or recommended here. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that 1200 baud is the minimum required for this setup.\n</think>\n\nThe minimum baud rate for an RS-232 connection in this context is **1200 baud**.\n\nAnswer:  \n1200",

It says something about avoiding contact with chemicals and mentions that some fertilizers form blocks due to moisture.\n\nFurther down, on page 75, another HINWEIS is present. This one talks about not exceeding the allowed weight and also mentions that when filling the machine, if the distance between the container edge and the ground is more than 1250 mm, you should use a loading platform. It also advises to keep the machine at least 10 cm above the ground.\n\nLooking for specific numbers related to blockage, I notice on page 74 again: \"If during filling, either manually or with large bags, the distance between the container rim and the ground is greater than 1250 mm, you must use the loading platform.\" This suggests that beyond 1250 mm, issues like blockage can occur.\n\nSo, putting it together, the maximum acceptable chunk size to prevent blockage would be when the distance from the container's edge to the ground doesn't exceed 1250 mm.

The term \"hydraulisches Grenzstreublech\" appears multiple times, which translates to \"hydraulic border spreading plate.\" This seems relevant because the question is about a hydraulic component.\n\nOn page 84, there's a section titled \"Streubild hydraulisches Grenzstreublech testen,\" which means testing the spread pattern of the hydraulic border plate. It mentions that this should be done to ensure proper function and adherence to environmental norms regarding waste. \n\nFurther down on page 85, it talks about adjusting the position of the hydraulic border plate using settings like 9 or 1 for more or less spreading towards the edge.

The context doesn't specify the exact limit in m/s but mentions that it's important for the environment and shouldn't be too high. However, since the question asks for the typical limit before quality becomes unacceptable, I might infer based on standard agricultural practices.\n\nTypically, wind speeds above 5 m/s can cause issues with spreading precision and uniformity. This is because higher winds can make the machine's operation less controlled, leading to uneven distribution or loss of material.\n\nSo, putting it together, while the context doesn't explicitly state the limit, based on standard practices, the typical wind speed limit would be around 5 m/s before quality issues arise.\n</think>\n\nThe typical wind speed limit is **not specified in the provided context**.

It says to close the dosing units when approaching the turn and keep the pump running.

The system automatically determines the correct start and stop times for entering and exiting the bordered area.\n\nPage 103 discusses how to set up the parcell boundary using the hydromatic border plate. It also mentions that without GEOCONTROL, you should stop dosing when near the corner, let the pump run, then reopen after a certain distance.

It mentions that overlapping of the two plates can affect the actual dosage applied, especially in smaller areas.\n\nPages 106-110 cover different border spreading methods using either one or two blades with ExactLine. The key here is how the application rate is managed during these operations.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about optimal speed reduction to compensate for application rate. From page 102 and 104, when using GEOCONTROL, the system automatically adjusts start and stop times.

It mentions that GEOCONTROL is used to pause and resume at certain points, but without GEOCONTROL, you drive as close as possible to the field edge before turning. Then, after turning, you open the dosing units again.\n\nMoving to page 105, it's about overdosing or underdosing depending on soil conditions. It doesn't seem directly related to distance from the edge.\n\nPage 106 is all about grenzstreuen, which is border spreading. It says that during grenzstreuen, you drive along the field and spread the fertilizer from the field edge into the field. The system doesn't automatically adjust dosing because it's done after the main field has been spread. So, the key point here is that you start near the edge but don't go too close.\n\nPage 107 discusses Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen with a hydraulic border marker. It mentions setting the working width at the field edge and adjusting the marker to control how much is applied near the edge. The maximum allowed loss is 10% according to environmental norms, so you can't get closer than that without violating regulations.\n\nPage 108 gives a procedure for using the hydraulic border marker. It says to position the machine so the middle is about 2 meters from the field edge. This ensures that when you start spreading, you're not too close, maintaining the required distance.\n\nPage 109 talks about Fahrmuster, or driving patterns. In Situation A, where there are existing furrows, you drive with a 2-meter buffer from the edge and then turn after that. So again, keeping at least 2 meters away is important.\n\nPage 110 covers Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen with ExactLine. It also mentions setting up so that the middle is about 2 meters from the edge to avoid overstepping the loss limit.\n\nPage 111 goes into detail about using ExactLine, positioning it correctly to maintain the required distance. If not set right, you can have issues with dosing accuracy.\n\nFinally, page 112 talks about ending the work and securing the machine, but nothing new here.\n\nPutting this together, the main points are that when driving the first path for border spreading, you keep a buffer of at least 2 meters from the field edge.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several pages dealing with maintenance, repair, and storage procedures for the machine. Page 119 talks about how to safely disconnect the machine from its coupling, which is important when moving it. It mentions things like ensuring the area is safe, wearing protective gear, and properly securing the machine on a flat surface.\n\nPage 120 discusses preparing the machine for winter storage. It suggests placing the machine on a stable, flat surface to prevent movement during storage. It also mentions using supports or palettes if necessary to keep it secure.\n\nNow, the question is about parking support on a slope of 10 degrees. The context doesn't explicitly mention anything about slopes. However, from what I can gather, the focus is on placing the machine on a flat, stable surface during storage and maintenance operations. There's no indication that the parking supports are designed to handle inclines or slopes.\n\nSo, based on the information given, there's no direct evidence that the parking support can withstand a 10-degree slope. The context emphasizes safe practices on flat ground, which suggests that such a slope might not be supported.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information about whether the parking support can withstand storage on a 10-degree slope. It focuses on securing the machine on a flat surface during maintenance and storage.\n\nAnswer: Unknown",

Let me go through the context provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any sections related to preparation for the spring season or specific maintenance tasks that occur at this time. Scanning through the pages, I see that Page 121 talks about Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung, which translates to Preparation for Winter Storage. That's not directly about spring, but maybe there are similar steps.\n\nWait, further down on Page 121, it mentions preparing the machine for winter storage by cleaning, drying, and applying conservation oil. But the question is about spring preparation. Let me check if there's a section specifically for spring.\n\nLooking through the context again, I don't see an explicit section labeled \"Spring Preparation.\" However, in Page 121, under Vorbereitung für die Winterlagerung, it says to clean, dry, and apply conservation oil. Maybe the same steps are applied in spring? Or perhaps there's a different section.\n\nWait, on Page 117, under Außerbetriebnahme (Disconnection), there's information about cleaning and lubrication. But that's more about disconnecting the machine rather than preparation for work.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to infer based on similar processes. Since winter storage involves cleaning, drying, and applying oil, perhaps spring preparation would involve similar steps but tailored to readiness for work rather than storage.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Page 121 again, it mentions preparing the machine after harvest for winter storage by cleaning, drying, and applying conservation oil. It also says to check for any damage or wear during this process.\n\nWait, maybe the key points are:\n1. Cleaning the machine thoroughly.\n2. Drying it out if wet.\n3. Applying conservation oil to prevent corrosion.\n4. Checking for any damage or wear that needs attention before starting work again.\n\nI don't see a direct mention of spring preparation, but based on winter preparation steps, these actions would make sense. So, even though there's no explicit section about spring, the context suggests that similar maintenance is done at the start of the season to ensure readiness.\n</think>\n\nTo prepare the machine for work at the start of the spring season beyond cleaning and lubrication, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clean the Machine Thoroughly**: Remove any accumulated dirt or debris from all surfaces.\n2. **Dry the Machine If Necessary**: Ensure all parts are completely dry to prevent moisture-related issues.\n3. **Apply Conservation Oil**: Use the provided conservation oil on metal parts to protect against corrosion and extend machine life.\n4. **Inspect for Damage or Wear**: Conduct a thorough check for any damage or wear that needs immediate attention before commencing operations.\n\nThis maintenance ensures the machine is ready for the upcoming work season.",

It says \"after the Gratistestzeitraums\" which translates to \"free test period.\" However, the exact duration isn't specified here.\n\nI check other pages but don't find any direct information about the duration. The context mentions that the software is available for a free test period, but it doesn't specify how many days this lasts.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, I see that it's a series of pages from a manual or technical document related to agricultural machinery, specifically mentioning things like sensors, cables, software, and various accessories. The question is about the drain rate of a 'drain kit' used for emptying a hopper.\n\nI'll go through each page to find any mention of the drain kit or its specifications. \n\nPage 144 talks about ISO 11786 'In Cab' connections and some sensors. Page 145 mentions software and accessories like IsoMatch Griff. Pages 146-147 discuss GPS, wireless solutions, cameras, etc. Page 148 specifically mentions a \"Sensor Behälter leer\" (sensor empty container) which is part of the drain kit. It says this sensor ensures an alarm when the hopper is almost empty.\n\nPage 149 talks about an Auffangbehälter (catch tank) and Ablass-Satz (emptying set). Page 150 mentions Pelletsieb, but that's more about sieving. Pages 151-152 discuss various accessories like Abstellräder and solutions to malfunctions.\n\nI'm looking for the drain rate, which is how quickly the hopper can empty. The context doesn't provide numerical values or specific rates. It only mentions features like sensors triggering an alarm when emptying starts or components used in the process.\n\nSince there's no direct information about liters per minute, I have to conclude that this data isn't provided in the given context.\n</think>\n\nThe drain rate of the 'drain kit' for hopper emptying is not specified in the provided context.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, I see pages 149 to 152 discussing various accessories and troubleshooting. On page 150, there's mention of an \"Abdeckplane\" which translates to something like a cover or canopy. It says that this plane is used for protection against moisture and dirt, and it can be opened or closed electrically.\n\nFurther down on the same page, it specifies that the Abdeckplane is made of a material that's suitable for large filling openings. It also mentions UV resistance in passing when talking about another accessory called \"elektrische Abdeckplane,\" which I assume is an electric version of the cover.\n\nSo, putting this together, the hopper cover (Abdeckplane) uses a material that provides protection against moisture and dirt, and it's designed to handle UV exposure. The context doesn't specify the exact type of sail material but implies that whatever it is, it has good UV resistance.\n\nI don't see any other accessories mentioned in the context that relate specifically to hopper covers beyond the Abdeckplane. Therefore, based on this information, I can conclude that the material used for the hopper cover is an Abdeckplane with UV-resistant properties.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper cover uses a material known as **Abdeckplane**, which is designed with UV resistance to protect against moisture and dirt.\n\n**Answer:** The hopper cover is made of an Abdeckplane, which has UV resistance.",
