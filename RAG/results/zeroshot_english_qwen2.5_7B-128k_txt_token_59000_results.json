However, the instruction suggests placing wheel chocks in front of the parking wheels if lowering the power lift could cause the machine to roll away, implying that a platform might be necessary for safety when the hopper is lowered close to the ground. \n\nGiven the lack of an exact numerical value, and based on common agricultural practices, we can infer that a platform would likely be required when the hopper rim is very close to or touching the ground.
