Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several steps mentioned related to stopping the spreader after a certain distance. The first step is \"Schlie\u00dfen Sie die Dosiereinheiten.\" Then it says, \"Schlenken Sie die Gelenkwelle ein stellen Sie die Drehzahl der Streuscheiben ein, wie in der entsprechenden Streutabelle wiedergegeben.\"\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. It seems like the spreader is stopping after moving 20 meters or more. The context says, \"Schlie\u00dfen Sie die Dosiereinheiten. Fahren Sie mitten \u00fcber den 1. Auffangbeh\u00e4lter und halten Sie erst an, wenn Sie mindestens 20 Meter weiter gefahren sind. Der Streuer streut [*] nach hinten wie zur side.\n\nSo the spreader stops after moving at least 20 meters. The context doesn't mention a specific frequency but rather that it's done when a certain distance is covered. It also mentions using the data from the strength table and automatic tests every 75 kg or minute, which affects the speed and distance. But for the question about how often it carries out these tests, I think it's more about the stopping condition than the frequency.\n\nWait, maybe the spreader stops automatically after a certain number of meters, but the exact frequency isn't specified in the context. The steps mention moving 20 meters or more, so perhaps it's done every time they reach that point. But without specific data on how often it does this, I can only infer based on the stopping condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spreader carries out these tests (like automatic calibration) at regular intervals, but the context doesn't provide a frequency number. It just says \"mindestens 20 Meter\" which translates to \"at least 20 meters.\" So perhaps it's done every time they reach that distance, or maybe more frequently.\n\nBut since the question is about how often it carries out these tests, and the context only mentions stopping after moving at least 20 meters, I think the answer should state that the spreader stops automatically after a minimum of 20 meters. There's no specific frequency mentioned, so I can't give an exact number.\n\nWait, but looking back, in one part it says \"Fahren Sie mitten \u00fcber den 1.

It doesn't mention how often it does this, just that it stops after moving at least 20 meters.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that the spreader carries out automatic calibration tests (like stopping) when a minimum of 20 meters is covered.

It says that if a tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, it can use an ISOMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable communication. That sounds like they're using ISOMatch's own communication system.\n\nLooking further, there's a part where it mentions that if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication, they can install an ISOMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz. This setup allows for communication between the tractor and the machine via ISOMatch. So, the tractor's driving speed would be transmitted through this ISOMatch system.\n\nI don't see any other information in the context that suggests a different method or tool for transmitting speed without ISOBUS.

There's mention of a Hauptschalter, which is probably the main switch. It says you can toggle it by holding down the button for at least one second.

However, since the user needs to know where the switch is, I should infer from the instructions.\n\nWait, actually, in the context provided, there's no specific mention of the switch's position. It just explains how to toggle it. So perhaps the answer is that the main switch button is located on the control panel or a specific area, but without more details, I can't specify where exactly.

It also mentions that the switch controls the status leiste, which includes various data types.

There's an image reference for some numbers, but I don't think those will affect the answer since they're more detailed than needed.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section that says: \"Wartung [Image] Halten Sie die nachstehenden Kontroll- und Wartungsintervalle ein, um die Maschine in einem guten Zustand zu halten. t\u00e4 gl ic h               nac h den e r st en 10 Be trieb sst und na ch  jeweils 1 0 0 St unde n min. 1x pr o J a hr Wie empf ohlen We nn ve rsc h lis sen         Seite\"\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing with the images and text.

Let me think again. The context says \"Wartung [Image]\" which might be a typo for waiting period. Then it lists holding back 10 breaks and 100 minutes each. So that would mean 10 breaks of some sort, maybe 10 minutes each, totaling 100 minutes? Or perhaps 10 hours in total.\n\nBut the exact wording is \"10 Be trieb sst und na ch  jeweils 1 0 0 St unde n min.\" which translates to 10 breaks and 100 minutes each.

The context mentions holding back waiting intervals of 10 breaks and 100 minutes each. So maybe it's 10 minutes between checks, totaling 100 minutes?

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact wording. The context says \"10 Be trieb sst und na ch  jeweils 1 0 0 St unde n min.\" which might mean 10 breaks and 100 minutes each, so perhaps 10 minutes between checks, totaling 100 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 10 hours in total.

So the total time would be 10 minutes plus 100 minutes, which is 110 minutes.\n\nWait, but the user's question is about how long after initial setup and maintenance before re-checking.

The text mentions that before using it, you must secure the framework on the machine and the Lamellenboxs (which are likely the container boxes) along the framework. There's also an instruction to refer to a manual for correct assembly.\n\nThen, there's a part about closing the position sensor on the framework with electronic components in the kasten (probably the storage area).

Additionally, it mentions referring to page 48 for information on how to assemble the mounting instructions correctly.\n\nLooking at the question, it's asking where the position sensor should be connected. From the context, I can see that the sensor needs to be attached to the framework using electronic components in the kasten. There are specific steps mentioned: \"Schalten Sie den Schlepper aus und ziehen Sie den Z\u00fcndschl\u00fcssel aus dem Z\u00fcndschloss.\" which translates to opening and closing the shlep from and taking out the z\u00fcndschl\u00fcssel (probably a lock).

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see a section where they mention calculating the required outflow. It says 600 Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) equals 27 (m) multiplied by 8 (km/h) multiplied by 25 (kg/ha). So that's 27 times 8 is 216, and then 216 times 25 gives 5400. Wait, but the result they show is 9 kg/min. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, it says 600 Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) equals 27 (m) times 8 (km/h) times 25 (kg/ha). So that's 27 * 8 = 216, and then 216 * 25 is indeed 5400. But the result they show is 9 kg/min. That doesn't add up because 5400 divided by something would be 9. Maybe I'm missing a step here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not 27 times 8 times 25, but maybe another number? Let me check again. Oh, wait, the result is 9 kg/min, so if 600 equals that product, then each part must be scaled down. So 600 divided by something gives 9. Maybe it's 600 divided by (27 * 8 * 25) which would be 600 / 5400 = 1/9 kg/min per unit? That seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me look at other parts of the context. There's a section where they calculate the required outflow again: 600 Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) equals 27 (m) times 8 (km/h) times 25 (kg/ha). So that part seems consistent.\n\nThen, there's another calculation for the required flow rate. It says Stellen Sie die Auslauf\u00f6ffnung ein, die in der Tabelle angegeben ist: J. Then calculates the required outflow as 3 times 9, which is 27 kg/min. Wait, so they're using a multiplier of 3 here.\n\nWait, but the question is about the general formula for calculating the flow rate. So looking back at the context, I see that in another part, it mentions calculating the required outflow as 600 equals 27 times 8 times 25, which gives 9 kg/min. But then later, they mention multiplying by 3 to get 27 kg/min.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me check again. The context says: \"Ben\u00f6tigte Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min) = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha)\". So that's 600 equals 27 times 8 times 25, which is 5400. But the result they show is 9 kg/min, so perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Let me think again: if 600 equals 27 * 8 * 25, then each unit contributes to that total. So perhaps the formula is (kg/min) = (m) * (km/h) * (kg/ha). But in this case, it's 600 kg/min equals 27 m times 8 km/h times 25 kg/ha.\n\nWait, but then if I rearrange that to solve for kg/min, it would be kg/min = (m * km/h * kg/ha) / 600. But in the context, they have 600 equals 27 * 8 * 25, which is 5400. So perhaps the formula is actually kg/min = (kg/ha) / 600 * m * km/h.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because kg/ha would be a large number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me focus on what's being asked: the general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer in kg/min.\n\nLooking back at the context, there are two sections where they calculate outflow. The first one says 600 equals 27 times 8 times 25, which gives 9 kg/min. But then later, when multiplying by 3, it becomes 27 kg/min. So perhaps the formula is (kg/ha) divided",

It also mentions that this test is done every year.\n\nAdditionally, there's a note about placing Auffangbeh\u00e4lter (filling containers) horizontally using a water gauge. This might be related to how the spreader distributes the fertilizer evenly by ensuring the water level is consistent across both sides.\n\nPutting it all together, the tray test checks whether the left and right spreaders are distributing the fertilizer equally.

It mentions that before each change in the Streumechanismus (which I think is the Streumer mechanism) or when exchanging parts between the Streumschiff and Stahlschiff, they perform this test. \n\nThen, it says that the tray test is used for an 24-meter-wide test. They provide images of seven Auffangbeh\u00e4lter, which are horizontal storage containers. The bandma\u00df (which I believe refers to a measuring tape or band) and water weight are needed to set up the containers horizontally.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section on how to perform the tray test. It says to schalten den Schlepper aus (open the lock), draw out the key from the z\u00fcndschloss (zinc coating), and detonate the Feststellbremse (fesimal fragment). After that, they disassemble the left Streuscheibe by moving the Kupplungsst\u00fcck (coupling piece) to the left. They also mention arreting it back with the same piece.\n\nAdditionally, there are images showing how to do this and another set of instructions for performing the test on a different width. The materials needed include the bandma\u00df, water weight, seven Auffangbeh\u00e4lter, and possibly other tools like a detonator or key.\n\nWait, but in the context provided, I don't see any mention of detonators or keys beyond what's used in the tray test.

The main materials seem to be the bandma\u00df, water weight, and the seven Auffangbeh\u00e4lter.\n\nI should make sure that these are all required. The context mentions using a tray test for 24 meters, so I think that's covered in the instructions. They also provide images of the setup, which suggests they need the containers and maybe some tools to assemble them correctly.\n\nSo putting it together, the materials needed are bandma\u00df, water weight, seven Auffangbeh\u00e4lter, and perhaps a detonator or key for detonating the fragment. But since the question is about what materials are required, I think the main ones are the bandma\u00df, water weight, and the containers.\n</think>\n\nThe tray test requires the following materials: bandma\u00df (tape), water weight, seven Auffangbeh\u00e4lter (horizontal storage containers).",

They also mention spacing at least 4 meters from the highest points and ensuring tests are done over more than 24 meters. Additionally, they can only test a portion of the spread after emptying the rest.\n\nThen there's an section about avoiding regaining or high humidity by not using the Streuer when it rains or has high humidity.

The key points seem to be about removing substances like Schmutz, Kunstd\u00fcnger, or Fett from the getriebe. There's a mention of measuring the Fettniveau, which I think refers to the thickness of the fat layer.\n\nOne specific instruction says: \"F\u00fcllen Sie in das Getriebe neues Fett hinzu, bis es fast aus der Pegel- und F\u00fcll\u00f6ffnung herauskommt.\" This translates to filling the getriebe with new fat until it's almost empty at the peg and fill opening. The text also mentions that the Kettengetriebe (the central part) is made of two kammern, each filled with EP 00/000. It says the content of one chamber is 0.25 liters.\n\nThe question is about the grease level in mm below the filler opening after the machine has stood still. From the context, I don't see any direct mention of a grease level or fat thickness measurement except for the Kettengetriebe's volume. However, the process described involves filling with fat until it's almost empty at the opening.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the required grease level in mm below the filler opening, but the text does talk about the Kettengetriebe's content and the process of filling with fat, I might infer that the grease level is determined by the volume. The chamber has 0.25 liters, which could relate to the thickness or spreadability of the fat.\n\nBut without specific data linking the volume directly to a grease level in mm below the opening, it's challenging to provide an exact measurement. Therefore, I might conclude that the required grease level isn't explicitly provided in the context and thus can't be accurately determined.\n</think>\n\nThe required grease level isn't explicitly provided in the context as there's no direct information linking the volume of 0.25 liters to a specific thickness in mm below the filler opening.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

Again, not related to the specific measurement they're asking about.\n\nThen there's a sentence: \"Einklemmen kann K\u00f6rperverletzungen verursachen.\" This says that cleaning can cause harm from body decay. Not relevant here either.\n\nThe next part is about hand handling: \"Der Abstand zwischen dem Auslaufrohr und der Streuscheibe muss 1,0 mm betragen.\" Okay, this seems directly related. It specifies the required distance between the discharge rope and the discharge bushing opening as 1.0 millimeters. \n\nContinuing down, there are several steps like \"L\u00f6sen Sie die Schrauben, mit denen das Auslaufrohr am Stern befestigt ist,\" which means solving the screws holding the discharge rope at the star. Then it says, \"Schieben das Auslaufrohr nach oben bzw. nach unten, bis der Abstand zur Streuscheibe bei 1,0 mm liegt.\" This is about moving the discharge rope up or down until the distance is correct.\n\nAnother instruction: \"Sie k\u00f6nnen auch Pl\u00e4ttchen mit einer Dicke von 1,0 mm zwischen das Auslaufrohr und die Streuscheibe legen und das Auslaufrohr darauf sacken lassen.\" So they can add plattchen with a diameter of 1.0 mm between the discharge rope and the discharge bushing.\n\nThen there's \"Ziehen Sie die Schrauben an, mit denen das Auslaufrohr am Stern auf der R\u00fchrerwelle befestigt ist,\" which means pulling the screws holding the discharge rope at the star to the r\u00fchrerwelle. It says later: \"Ziehen Sie die 2 Schrauben wieder an, ohne die Stellgliedplatte zu verschieben.\" So they can pull those two again after moving the plate.\n\nNext instruction: \"F\u00fchren Sie diese Kontrolle auch auf der anderen Seite aus.\" This means performing a check on the other side as well. Finally, it says: \"Befestigen Sie das Armaturenbrett, indem Sie die 3 Feststellkn\u00f6pfe festdrehen.\"\n\nSo all these steps are about adjusting and checking the distance between the discharge rope and the discharge bushing opening to be exactly 1.0 millimeters.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are two tables here. The first table seems to list different materials and their respective coefficients for reibung (which is probably the yield strength or something similar) and friction. The second table lists other materials with their quality and friction values.\n\nLooking at the first table, under \"Reibungskoeffizienten\" which translates to coefficient of friction, I see entries like 0.10, 0.13, etc., for different materials. The question mentions a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction.\n\nWait, the second table has \"Wartung\" which might be the width of the bolt or something else, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Let me focus on the first table because it directly relates to the material and its properties.\n\nIn the first table, under \"Anzugsmomente\", there are entries like 4.6.0,10; 4.6.0,13; etc., which seem to be torque values for different materials. The numbers before the dot probably indicate the quality (like 10, 13) and after the dot, it's the friction coefficient.\n\nSo, looking at the entry \"Anzugsmomente.8.8.0,10\", I see that the quality is 10 and the friction is 0.10. But the question specifies a quality of 10.9 and friction of 0.13. Hmm, there's no such entry in the first table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. The entries are structured as \"Anzugsmomente.x.y.z\", where x is the quality, y is the width (maybe), and z is the friction coefficient. So for example, 4.6.0,10 would mean quality 10, width 4.6, and friction 0.10.\n\nBut in the question, it's a M18 hexagon steel bolt with quality 10.9 and friction 0.13. Looking at the first table again, I don't see an entry for quality 10.9. The closest is quality 10, which has entries like 4.6.0,10; 4.8.0,10; etc.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers before the dot are not just quality and width but something else. Let me check again: \"Anzugsmomente.8.8.0,10\" would mean quality 10, width 8.8, friction 0.10. But I'm looking for a M18 bolt.\n\nWait, the bolt is M18 hexagon steel. In the first table, under \"Reibungskoeffizienten\", there's an entry for 0.13 which might correspond to quality 10.9 and friction 0.13. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the Reibungskoeffizienten column, I see entries like 0.10, 0.13, etc., under different materials. The question mentions a 0.13 friction coefficient, so perhaps it's for quality 10.9. But in the first table, there are multiple entries with 0.13: \"0,10\", \"0,13\", etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about a specific bolt size and material. In the context, under Reibungskoeffizienten, for quality 10.9, there's an entry with 0.13. So perhaps that corresponds to torque.\n\nLooking at the torque columns in the first table: \"Anzugsmomente\" has entries like 4.6.0,10; 4.8.0,10; etc., which are likely torque values for different materials and widths. The question is about a M18 bolt with quality 10.9 and friction 0.13.\n\nWait, but in the first table, under \"Reibungskoeffizienten\", I don't see an entry that directly corresponds to M18. Maybe the M18 refers to the material or size elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers before the dot are quality and width, so 4.6.0 might be quality 10, width 4.6, etc.\n\nBut since the question is about a specific M18 bolt with quality 10.9 and friction 0.13, I need to find an",

The first section lists some data related to self-secureable steel bolts, including their torque requirements for different qualities (M5, M22, M24) and friction values. The second section seems to be an image but doesn't provide specific numbers.\n\nLooking at the first part of the context, there are lines like \"Anzugsmomente.70 (A2).0.10.\" which probably means a 70 quality, A2 grade, and 0.10 friction.

This method involves creating a stable base on one side of the boundary and then using it to fill or reinforce the other side. \n\nLooking at the context, there's mention of \"Grenzabstreuen mit Grenzstreublech\" which refers to limiting boundary erosion with the limit Streublech. It also talks about extending a trapezoidal shape into a triangular one with full overlap, indicating that this method can be applied in various garden setups.\n\nThe context mentions that for small gardens, especially those in poor soil conditions, using one-sided boundary spreading is beneficial because it helps stabilize the base and prevents further erosion. This technique allows for easier maintenance and ensures that the garden remains healthy by providing a solid foundation.\n\nSo putting this together, yes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens as it's effective in stabilizing boundaries and preventing soil erosion, which is crucial for maintaining healthy plants.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens.

Let me start by breaking down the terms.\n\nFirst, \"boundary spreading\" \u2013 I think this refers to a method used in manufacturing or engineering where materials are spread across a boundary or edge. It's often used in processes like etching or forming parts. The term \"seven-sided\" suggests that there are seven sides involved in this process.\n\nNow, \"hydraulicborder spreading plate.\" I'm not entirely sure about the exact terminology here. Maybe it's a specific tool or device used with hydraulics? Hydraulics involve fluid pressure and movement, so perhaps this is a specialized tool for spreading materials using hydraulic principles.\n\nPutting them together, it sounds like they're combining boundary spreading with a Hydraulicborder spreading plate. So, maybe it's a method where seven-sided material is spread across a boundary using a specific Hydraulicborder plate that incorporates hydraulics.\n\nI'm not entirely certain about the exact application or terminology, but based on the context provided, I think this refers to a precise method of spreading materials in a seven-sided configuration using a Hydraulicborder tool. The answer should be concise and match the expected format.\n</think>\n\nThe term \"seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulicborder spreading plate\" refers to a method where material is spread across a seven-sided boundary using a Hydraulicborder spreading plate, likely involving hydraulics for precise control.\n\nAnswer: Seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulicborder spreading plate involves spreading materials in a seven-sided configuration using a Hydraulicborder tool.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several points about how fertilizers affect the environment. The first sentence says that many types of fertilizers draw water and can form large cracks or holes in the soil. This is because they can create big gaps when they spread out. Then it mentions that these cracks can either stop the water from reaching the plants (verifying) or cause the plants to die.\n\nThe context also talks about handling weather conditions, like using a good closed deck for heavy rain. It emphasizes not letting the fertilizer stay in the soil too long because of humidity. Additionally, it warns against harming the environment by not removing fertilizers when it's raining heavily and suggests thoroughly cleaning the dosier parts like the dosier openings and outflow pipes.\n\nPutting this together, the key points are that fertilizers attract water to create cracks or holes, which can either stop plants from growing or cause them to die. This is because they spread through the soil, creating spaces that block the water flow. The context also warns about handling these materials in a way that doesn't damage the environment.\n\nSo, the main reason why most fertilizers attract water is due to their ability to create cracks or holes in the soil when they are applied.

The question is about grease nipples not being lubricated. In the context, there's a section where greasing is mentioned: \"Die Gelenkwelle ist mit Schmiernippeln versehen\" which means the glenkowsels are covered with Schmiernippel.

The only relevant part is about ISO vs non-ISO Schlepper switching to ISO communication for power supply cables, which isn't related to battery flats.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there's no information provided that addresses the number of hours IsoMatch Tellus can operate before a tractor battery flattens when switched on with the engine off. So, I should respond that this information is not present in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide any information about how long IsoMatch Tellus can operate before a typical tractor battery flattens under these conditions.

There are several instructions on how to use them, including placing Auffangbeh\u00e4lter (which I think is German for \"container\" or \"hold\") along the path.\n\nLooking at the specific part about spacing: it says \"starten Sie den Schlepper und schalten Sie die Zapfwelle ein.\" That translates to starting the Schlepper and setting the flow rate. It also mentions that the correct flow rate is 540 U/min, which is a standard value reduced by 25%, so 400 U/min.\n\nThe context then goes on about using these plates for both sides, ensuring they are not stuck or stuck to the side they aren't spreading along.

One of them says, \"Ben\u00f6tigte Materialien\" which means required materials. It lists a band meter or measuring tape and mentions water weight to set up feeding bowls horizontally. Then it gives details like 7 feeding bowls, images, RPMs (rotations per minute), and some measurements.\n\nAnother instruction is about the wind conditions during the test: \"F\u00fchren Sie den Streumengentest bei trockenem Wetter, geringer Luftfeuchtigkeit und einer maximalen Windgeschwindigkeit von 3 m/s (Windst\u00e4rke 2) aus.\" This translates to conducting the strummer test in bad weather, low humidity, and high wind speed of 3 m/s with wind strength 2.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section about feeding bowls: \"Angenommen, Sie m\u00f6chten Schneckenk\u00f6rner mit den Eigenschaften verstreuen, wie sie in der nachstehenden Streutabelle wiedergegeben sind.\" This is about feeding bowls.

The closest related information is about testing conditions: \"Ben\u00f6tigte Materialien\" include RPMs like 525 rpm and 950 rpm, but those are rotation speeds, not wind speeds.\n\nWait, maybe there's another part.

It says this must be at least 20% of the eigengewicht on the front and 45% on the rear. So, I think that means the tire pressure should be set between these percentages.\n\nWait, but how does that translate into a specific range? The context doesn't give exact numbers, just percentages. Maybe in transport mode, the runner's axel load is typically around 20-30% of its eigengewicht on one side and 45-50% on the other. So combining these, perhaps the tire pressure should be set between 20% to 50% of the eigengewicht.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Maybe there are standard values or specific recommendations for transport mode. Let me check again. The context mentions \"mindestens 20 % Eigengewicht auf der Vorderachse und 45 % auf der Hinterachse,\" which means at least 20% on the front and 45% on the rear. So, if we consider a standard tire pressure that covers these percentages, maybe it's around 18-25 PSI or something like that.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

One section discusses setting the same speed as normal or reducing the dose by 25%. Another talks about starting the drive along the field, stopping at certain points, and stopping when specific conditions are met.\n\nLooking more closely, there's a part where it says: \"\u00d6ffnen Sie die Dosiereinheit einige Meter, bevor Sie mitten \u00fcber den ersten Beh\u00e4lter fahren.\" This translates to opening the dose unit some meters before starting over towards the first container. It also mentions stopping when at least an working area (like 24 meters) is passed. The text then goes on about the Streubild and its coverage.\n\nIn another part, it says: \"Wahrscheinlich treffen Sie in den mittleren Beh\u00e4ltern eine geringere Dosis an.

The first step says, \"Markieren Sie die erste Fahrt auf halber Arbeitsbreite (1/2 X Meter) ab dem Feldrand (in der ersten Streuspur).\" That means they're marking the first path halfway across the field. So, that's 0.5 meters from the edge.\n\nThen there are some other steps about handling the border spreading with ExactLine, which I think refers to a specific method of driving. The next step says, \"Fahren Sie den \u00e4u\u00dfersten Arbeitsgang auf einer halben Arbeitsbreite (1/2 X Meter) ab Parzellenrand.\" That reinforces that it's 0.5 meters from the edge.\n\nThe context also mentions that for these border spreading cases, they mark the first path halfway across. So, putting this together, the distance tolerance is half a meter from the field edge when driving the first path.\n\nI don't see any other information in the context that changes this distance. It's consistently stated as 0.5 meters. Therefore, I can confidently say that the distance tolerance is 0.5 meters.\n</think>\n\nThe distance tolerance from the field edge for the first path in border spreading is 0.5 meters.\n\nAnswer: 0.5 meters",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are images mentioned multiple times, which probably refers to the parking support itself. The key part is where it says \"Vor dem ersten Gebrauch\" and then mentions \"Parken Sie nur mit leerem Beh\u00e4lter Parken Sie die Maschine auf den Abstellr\u00e4dern nur, wenn der Beh\u00e4lter leer ist!\" That means you can park only when the handle is empty. \n\nLooking further down, there are sections about the mass limits of different parts. The masses are given in kilograms: 4895 kg for the maximum weight, and then some variations with \"Ohne Abdeckplane\" which I think refers to a version without an anchor plate. The masses increase by 27.5 kg each section after that.\n\nThe question is about storage on a slope of 10 degrees. So, I need to see if the support can handle that slope. From the context, it seems like the mass limits are for different configurations, but there's no specific mention of a slope or angle in the data provided. The masses given don't seem to account for any load on an incline.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact specifications for parking supports on slopes, so I might need to make an educated guess based on typical engineering principles. Generally, structures designed for storage on slopes would have considerations for stability and load distribution. However, without specific data from the context, it's hard to give a precise answer.\n\nSince there's no direct information about slope resistance or angle-specific mass limits in the provided context, I might conclude that the parking support isn't specified to handle a 10-degree slope based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe parking support is not specified to withstand storage on a 10-degree slope based on the provided context.\n\n[No specific information about slope resistance or angle-specific mass limits is present in the context.

It says that before setting up for outer inspection, they should first clean and lubricate the machine. But it doesn't mention anything beyond cleaning and lubrication specifically for spring season preparation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read through again. The context mentions \"Au\u00dferbetribnahme\" which is outer inspection. It says that before this, they should first clean and lubricate. So, the main action here is cleaning and lubricating beyond just cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation.\n\nBut wait, the question is about what to do at the start of the spring season specifically to prepare it for work beyond cleaning and lubrication. The context doesn't mention any other actions beyond cleaning and lubrication in this section. So maybe there's no additional action mentioned beyond cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about what should be done specifically to prepare it beyond cleaning and lubrication. Since the context only mentions cleaning and lubrication as part of the outer inspection process, but not any other actions, maybe the answer is that no additional action is needed beyond cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to infer from the context. Let me check again. The section says: \"Am Ende der Erntesaison wird die Maschine f\u00fcr die Winterlagerung vorbereitet.\" So, end of harvest, machine prepared for winter building. Then it goes into outer inspection details, mentioning cleaning and lubrication as a first step.\n\nSo the main action is cleaning and lubricating before outer inspection. Therefore, beyond that, perhaps nothing else is needed specifically for spring season preparation. But wait, maybe I'm missing something about the entire process of preparing for work in general, not just winter building.\n\nWait, the question is about spring season preparation beyond cleaning and lubrication. So if the context doesn't mention any other actions, then the answer would be that no additional action is needed beyond cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the context only mentions cleaning and lubrication as part of the outer inspection process. Maybe there's another section or part of the text that I haven't read yet that provides more information on spring season preparation beyond just cleaning and lubrication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply that no additional action is needed beyond cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation because the context doesn't mention any other steps. So the answer would be \"No additional actions are needed beyond cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation.\"\n\nWait, but the question says \"specifically to 'prepare it for the work'\". The term \"work\" here might refer to outer inspection or winter building. Since the context only mentions cleaning and lubrication as part of that process, maybe the answer is that no additional action is needed beyond cleaning and lubrication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to infer from other parts of the text. Let me check if there's any mention of other preparation steps in the spring season. The context doesn't seem to indicate any other actions beyond cleaning and lubrication for outer inspection or winter building.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is that no additional action is needed beyond cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation.\n</think>\n\nNo additional actions are needed beyond cleaning and lubrication for spring season preparation.",

This is important because it affects the efficiency and performance of the motor. The discharge bushing is a critical component that must be precisely positioned for optimal operation.\n\nNow, 'feeler gauge' materials are used in metrology, which is the science of measurement. These materials are designed to measure small dimensions accurately. Common types include precision gauges like ball bearings, roller gauges, and other specialized tools. In the context of discharge bushings, the material would need to be both durable and precise.\n\nLooking at the provided context, I see mentions of \"Feststellkn\u00f6pfe\" (fixed knobs) and \"Armaturenbrett\" (armature nut). These are mechanical components used in machinery, but they don't directly relate to measuring height. However, the instructions mention that if a fit is off by more than 1 mm, specific steps are taken to adjust them.\n\nThe key part here is understanding what material is used for checking discharge bushing height. Since it's about measuring height, I'm thinking of materials like ball bearings or roller gauges. Ball bearings are known for their precision and durability, which would be ideal for this measurement.\n\nI don't see any mention of other materials in the context related to discharge bushing height checks.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several commands related to metal dichtrings. The first command is \"Nehmen Sie die Metalldichtringe ab.\" which means take the metal dichtrings away. Then later on, I see another mention of \"Tauschen Sie die Kunststoffdichtring aus.\" which translates to exchange the synthetic dichtrings.\n\nWait, so the commands are about exchanging or removing these rings. The first command is taking them away, and then a later one is swapping out synthetic ones for metal ones. So that means the material being referred to here is metal, specifically metal seal rings.\n</think>\n\nThe material of the 'metal seal rings' is metal.\n\nAnswer: Metal",

I see mentions of IM Tellus sensors, which might be relevant here since they're part of the ISO standard. There's also a section about extension cables for ISO 11786 in a cab tractor connection.\n\nIn that specific part, it says: \"Input IM Tellus mit ISO11786 'In Cab' Anschluss\" and mentions that the optimal cable length is 143 meters. So, I think that's the key information needed for this question.\n\nI should make sure there are no other details in the context that might provide more information or a different answer. The mention of ISOMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz also includes a 143-meter length, but since the question is about 'extension cable' specifically related to ISO 11786 in a cab tractor connection, the main point here is the 143 meters.\n\nI don't see any other cables or extensions mentioned that are relevant beyond this. So, I can confidently say that the optimal extension cable length for ISO 11786 in a cab tractor connection is 143 meters.\n</think>\n\nThe specific 'extension cable' length of 143 meters is optimal for ISO 11786 in a cab tractor connection.\n\nAnswer: 143 meters",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see mentions of IsoMatch Griff andIsoMatch GeoControl, but those seem like company names rather than software licenses. The context does mention IsoMatch GEOCONTROL, which seems relevant. \n\nLooking further down, there's a section about IsoMatch's website: [www.isomatchshop.com]. They provide details on how the software works, including features like task controller, external dosing, and management of GEOSPREAD functions.\n\nI notice that under \"Ortsbezogene Steuerung Ihres GEOSPREADERS,\" it says they can set up the system to restrict GEOSPREAD to a specific area. It also mentions an offset for the GEOSPREAD control, which is crucial because without this, the software might not function correctly in certain areas.\n\nThe question asks about the free test period duration. I don't see any information about trial periods or activation periods here. The context doesn't mention anything related to testing or trials for the software. It only talks about features and how to use them.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the free test period, I can't extract a precise answer from this context.

The term \"Hydraulisches Grenzstreublech\" is translated as \"Hydraulic Limiting Gap,\" and it's mentioned that this can handle both filling and discharging from a limit gap.\n\nLooking further, I see entries about sensors in various systems. There's a section titled \"Verteiler\" which refers to a distribution system. Under that, there are entries like \"hydraulisches Grenzstreublech\" with details on how it affects the hopper's empty sensor. The numbers listed seem to be part of a table or list.\n\nI notice that under \"Hydraulisches Grenzstreublech,\" there's an entry for \"St\u00f6rung/Verstopfung 114\" and \"Vorgewende anschlie\u00dfen mit GEOCONTROL-Funktion 100.\" These details might relate to the sensor setup, but I'm not sure how they directly answer the question about the valve set with a hopper empty sensor.\n\nThe key term here is \"Zubeh\u00f6r,\" which translates to \"Valve Set\" and is associated with a hopper system. The mention of \"Beh\u00e4lter leer Sensor\" indicates that there's a sensor inside the hopper, likely for emptying or filling purposes. \n\nI don't see any other valve types mentioned in the context related to this specific setup.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the drain rate in liters per minute for a \"drain kit\" when the hopper is emptying. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there's some information about throughput, which is 9 kg/min. That might be useful because sometimes flow rates can be converted from mass flow to volume flow depending on density. But wait, the question is about liters per minute, so I need to know if the density of the material being drained affects this conversion.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section where they mention calculating the required throughput for the drain kit by multiplying 3 x 9 kg/min, which gives 27 kg/min. Then it says this value is found at the Dosierstellung (dosage setting) which is 18 + 3 = 21. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the dosing calculation isn't directly related to the drain rate but more about how much material needs to be added or removed. The next part talks about a man-made ABDE test, which is used to check the outflow. They mention using a filled bucket and pulling it out of the hopper. Then they instruct on opening the right side of the hopper, removing the plug from the left, and closing it again.\n\nThere's also an image mentioned for the ABDE test, but I can't see images here. The text says to enter the dosing value into a specific field, which is 600. Then they mention reading the dosage table or estimating based on the nearest available throughput. Finally, they ask to open the right side of the hopper and close it again.\n\nBut none of this directly addresses the drain rate in liters per minute for the drain kit. The main numbers given are 9 kg/min through throughput calculations, but I don't see any conversion or specific values related to liters. Maybe the context is about a different part of the system that's not provided here.\n\nSince the question is about the drain kit's drain rate and there's no direct information on liters per minute in the context, perhaps the answer is \"Unknown\" because the necessary data isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide specific information about the drain rate in liters per minute for the \"drain kit.\" Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**Unknown**",

There's an absorption note that says \"Berechnung der Achslast bei beladenen Maschinen,\" which translates to calculating the axial load for loaded machines. The page 13 has information about how the cover is made and its properties.\n\nLooking at the sections, there are mentions of the cover being used in industrial settings, especially with electric and mechanical components. It talks about using the cover for stability and protection against dust or liquid. \n\nThe context also includes a section on \"Elektrische Abdeckplane,\" which refers to electric deck planes. This plane is designed for larger openings and can be operated electrically. The material used here is probably steel, as it's common in industrial machinery.\n\nRegarding UV resistance, the cover might use materials that are UV-resistant to prevent fading or degradation when exposed to UV light. From what I recall, some common UV-resistant materials include zinc-coated steel, which is often used in industrial applications for its durability and resistance to UV exposure.\n\nPutting this together, the material for the hopper cover is likely a type of steel with good UV resistance. The specific UV resistance would depend on the exact design and application, but it's important for preventing fading over time.\n</think>\n\nThe hopper cover uses steel as the material, which is known for its durability and UV resistance, ensuring longevity in industrial settings.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",
