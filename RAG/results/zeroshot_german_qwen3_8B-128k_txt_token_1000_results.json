The user is asking how the tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information. The context mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, you can use an IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz (power supply cable set) to add ISOBUS communication. Once that's done, the tractor's speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to IsoMatch.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about transmitting speed when there's no ISOBUS. The context says that if the tractor lacks ISOBUS, you can install the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS. Then, the speed is sent through ISOBUS. So the answer would involve using that cable set to add ISOBUS, allowing speed transmission via ISOBUS.\n\nBut the question is about the method when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that you need to install the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS, which then allows the speed to be transmitted. So the direct answer is using the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to add ISOBUS communication, which then transmits the speed via IS. But the user might be looking for the specific method. Let me check the exact wording in the context.\n\nLooking at the context: \"Nicht-ISO Schlepper mit IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz anpassen\" translates to adjusting non-ISO tractors with the IsoMatch power cable set. Then it says that after installation, the tractor is fully ISOBUS-equipped, and the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS. So the answer is that the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to enable ISOBUS, allowing speed transmission. Therefore, the answer is that the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to add ISOBUS communication, which then transmits the speed. But the question is about how the speed is transmitted when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that you need to install the cable set to enable ISOBUS, which then allows the transmission. So the precise answer is using the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS communication, which then transmits the speed via ISOBUS. But the user might want the exact phrase from the context. The context says: \"Die Fahrgeschwindigkeit Ihres Schleppers (oder der gezogenen Maschine) wird über den ISOBUS an IsoMatch durchgegeben.\" So the method is using the ISOBUS after adding the cable set. Therefore, the answer is that the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to enable ISOBUS communication, allowing the speed to be transmitted via ISOBUS. But the question is specifically about the method when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that the cable set is used to add ISOBUS, which then allows the transmission. So the answer is: Install the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS communication, allowing the speed to be transmitted via ISOBUS. But the answer needs to be concise. The exact answer from the context is: \"Nicht-ISO Schlepper mit IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz anpassen\" and then the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS. So the answer is that the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz is used to add ISOBUS, enabling the speed transmission. Therefore, the answer is: Use the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS communication, allowing the tractor's speed to be transmitted via ISOBUS.\n</think>\n\nUse the IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz to enable ISOBUS communication, allowing the tractor's speed to be transmitted via ISOBUS.",

Scanning through the pages, on page 46, there's a section about the \"Arbeitsbreite\" which is translated as working width.

However, the question specifically asks what determines the working width. The direct answer from the context is that the working width is primarily determined by the spreader disc's rotation speed.

The text says: \"Schließen Sie den Positionssensor an den Kasten mit Elektronik auf dem Streuer an:\" which translates to \"Connect the position sensor to the box with electronics on the spreader.\" \n\nWait, the exact phrase is \"an den Kasten mit Elektronik auf dem Streuer an.\" So the sensor should be connected to the box (Kasten) that has electronics (Elektronik) on the spreader (Streuer). \n\nAlso, there's a note about the sensor being connected to the machine's electronics. But the specific instruction here is about the box with electronics on the spreader. The answer needs to be precise. The key part is \"Kasten mit Elektronik auf dem Streuer.\" So the answer should state that the sensor is connected to the box with electronics on the spreader. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Checking other pages, like Page 48 talks about the Auffangbehälter but not the sensor. So the answer is from Page 47. The exact answer is \"den Kasten mit Elektronik auf dem Streuer\" which translates to \"the box with electronics on the spreader.\" So the answer should be that the position sensor should be connected to the box with electronics on the spreader.\n</think>\n\nThe position sensor for the hydraulic border spreading plate should be connected to the box with electronics on the spreader.",

The context mentions that when very low doses (less than 25 kg/ha) are desired, the system can't perform automatic calibration because the dose is too small. To avoid clogging, you can close two of the three spreader openings. The remaining opening must be more open since the flow rate through one opening needs to be three times higher to maintain the same dose.\n\nThen there's a part about the fine dosing lever.

The lever has markings for the number of spreader openings: 3 open for normal, and 1 open with 2 closed for fine dosing. The steps involve turning off the tractor, pulling the lever out, adjusting it to the desired position, letting it lock, and repeating on the other spreader disc.\n\nSo the answer should include closing two openings, adjusting the lever to the 1 open/2 closed position, and ensuring the lever is locked.

Let me confirm there's no other formula mentioned. The rest of the context talks about steps to calculate it, but the actual formula is the one with the three variables divided by 600. \n\nSo the answer is the formula: (Arbeitsbreite × Fahrgeschwindigkeit × Ausbringmenge) / 600.

Der Abstand zwischen der Maschine und der Plattform darf maximal 200 mm betragen.\" Translating that, it means \"Drive the machine, on a fixed loading platform, onto the platform. The distance between the machine and the platform must not exceed 200 mm.\"\n\nSo the key point here is that the maximum allowed distance is 200 mm. The question is specifically about the maximum distance between the spreader (which I assume refers to the machine here) and the loading platform. The context mentions this exact figure, so the answer should be 200 mm. I need to make sure there's no other mention of different distances elsewhere in the text. Scanning through the rest of the context, I don't see any other numbers related to this specific distance. Therefore, the answer is 200 mm.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \n200 mm",

Der Kunstdünger bleibt dann an den Auffangbehältern kleben, wodander das erhaltene Bild nicht mehr korrekt ist.\" And another instruction: \"Streuen Sie nie bei Windgeschwindigkeiten von mehr als 3 m/s (Windstärke 2).\" \n\nSo, both the test and actual spreading should not be done above 3 m/s. The answer should be 3 m/s. Let me check if there's any other mention. The question is about both the tray test and actual spreading, and the context clearly states 3 m/s for both scenarios.

The relevant section seems to be under \"Einsatz auf dem Feld\" (Field Operation). \n\nLooking at the instructions, there's a part that says: \"Stellen Sie die ExactLine gemäß der (Online-)Streutabelle in die gewünschte Stellung.\" This translates to setting the ExactLine according to the (Online) spreading table. Then, it mentions starting the tractor and adjusting the PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM using the (Online) spreading table or the table on the preceding page. \n\nSo the key points here are the Online spreading table and the table on the previous page. The answer should mention both sources. Also, the user needs to refer to the \"Streutabelle\" (spreading table) for the correct settings. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is precise and only includes the information directly related to the question. The answer should state that the Online spreading table and the table on the preceding page are the sources for setting the correct RPM. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of RPM settings. The context also mentions adjusting the PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM based on the table, so that's confirmed. No other sources are mentioned, so the answer should be those two tables.\n</think>\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nThe correct PTO shaft and spreading disc RPM settings are determined using the (Online-)Streutabelle or the table on the preceding page.",

I need to find the exact information from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context. The question is about a spreading disc (Streuscheibe) that's spreading irregularly. The context mentions that if such an issue is detected, you should stop spreading immediately and turn off the power take-off (Zapfwelle). \n\nLooking at the relevant part: \"Wenn Sie während des Streuens: · feststellen, dass eine Streuscheibe nichts oder unregelmäßig verstreut, während die Dosiereinheiten geöffnet sein, · erheblichen Lärm hören, · starke Schwingungen der Maschine wahrnehmen, · auf dem Hauptbildschirm den Alarm feststellen, dass die Zapfwelle nicht eingeschaltet ist, wenngleich diese sehr wohl eingeschaltet ist, · auf dem Hauptbildschirm den Alarm feststellen, dass die Dosiereinheiten nicht geschlossen werden kann, → siehe Bedienungsanleitung der Software. Das Streuen unverzüglich einstellen! Die Zapfwelle sofort abstellen!\"\n\nSo the key points here are: stop spreading immediately and turn off the Zapfwelle. The answer should be concise, so the exact instruction is to stop spreading and turn off the power take-off. The answer needs to be in English, precise, and match the format. The user might be operating machinery, so safety is crucial here.

The user might be using \"discharge bushings\" to mean the discharge nozzles or outlets. \n\nIn line 11, it says \"2 Schmiernippel auf beide Auslassdosen\" which could mean 2 nipples per discharge nozzle, but since it's \"beide Auslassdosen\" (both discharge nozzles), maybe total 2 nipples for both? Wait, the original German says \"2 Schmiernippel auf beide Auslassdosen\" which could be interpreted as 2 nipples for each of the two discharge nozzles, totaling 4?

The question is about the 3900 model. \n\nLooking at the rows, row 5 is \"Eigengewicht (kg)\" which translates to self-weight or empty weight. The entries under 3900 for row 5 are 795 kg. Then row 6 is \"Maximale Zuladung (kg)\" which is maximum load, but that's not the weight of the machine itself. \n\nRow 10 and 11 talk about the container weight with and without the cover plane. For 3900, row 10 is 367.5 kg without the cover, and row 11 is 414.5 kg with the cover. However, the question is about the weight of the machine, not the container. \n\nRow 5's 795 kg is the machine's own weight. But wait, the user might be asking for the total weight including the container? Wait, the question is \"weight in kg of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900\".

But that's the maximum total weight, which includes the load. \n\nWait, the user might be confused between the machine's own weight and the total weight. The question is a bit ambiguous. But the exact answer would depend on what's being asked. The question says \"weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900\". The Eigengewicht (row 5) is 795 kg. However, the user might be referring to the total weight including the container and load. But the context doesn't specify. \n\nWait, looking back, the question is about the machine's weight. The Eigengewicht is the machine's own weight. The Maximales Gesamtgewicht is the maximum total weight, which includes the machine, container, and load. But the question is about the machine's weight. So the answer should be 795 kg. However, the user might have meant the total weight. But the question is phrased as \"weight of the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3900\", which is the machine itself. Therefore, the answer is 795 kg. But I need to check the context again. \n\nLooking at row 5: Eigengewicht (kg) for 3900 is 795. So that's the machine's own weight. The answer should be 795 kg. However, the user might have intended the total weight. But the question is not clear. However, the context doesn't mention the total weight of the machine including the container. The Maximales Gesamtgewicht is 4895 kg, but that's the maximum total weight, which includes the machine, container, and load. So the machine's own weight is 795 kg.

Scanning through the context, I see a section labeled \"Zustand Schaufeln\" which translates to \"Condition of the vanes.\" \n\nLooking at the table under \"Wartungsintervalle\" (Maintenance Intervals), there's an entry numbered 4: \"Zustand Schaufeln\" with a dot and no specific interval mentioned. However, the rows above and below might give clues. The entries for other components like the impeller (Rührer) and the dosing mechanism have intervals specified, such as \"nach den ersten 10 Betriebsstunden\" (after the first 10 operating hours) and \"min. 1x pro Jahr\" (at least once per year). \n\nBut for the vanes (Schaufeln), the entry is listed under the same table.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's question says \"M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality\". The context's table for M6 has entries for 4.6, 8.8, 10.9, 12.9. The 70 (A2) isn't listed. The context's note mentions that the friction coefficient of 0.10 is for oiled sheet, cast iron, hardened surfaces, etc., and 0.13 for dry sheet. The user's question specifies a friction of 0.2, which isn't in the context. Therefore, the answer isn't present in the context. So, the correct response would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\".\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

The context directly states that they attract water, but does it explain why? Wait, the context doesn't give a reason for why they attract water; it just states that they do. The user's question is about the reason, but the context only mentions the effect (forming lumps) and not the cause.

The context has several pages, and the relevant part seems to be around the table with the Delicia Schnecken Linsen. Let me scan through the text.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section that mentions \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" followed by a table. The table has entries like \"0   6+0   0,21  C   0,54  5,4  4,5      3,9  3,4  3,0        2,7        2,5\" and so on. Each row seems to represent different settings with numbers like 6+0, 6+1, etc., and values in kg/min and km/h. \n\nThe question is about the specific type of slug pellets used. The text mentions \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" but then lists various settings. However, the exact name of the product isn't repeated in the table. The first mention is \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" and then the table entries might be the different dosing settings. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the specific type used in the example. The example in the context is under the \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" section. The table might be showing different dosing options for that product. But the question is about the specific type, not the dosing settings. \n\nLooking again, the first line after the image mentions \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" and then the table. The table's entries are for different dosing rates and settings. However, the exact product name isn't specified beyond \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen.\" The answer might be that the specific type is \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" itself. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"specific type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' slug pellets.\" The context doesn't mention any sub-type or variant beyond the name. The table is about the dosing settings for that product. Therefore, the answer is that the specific type used is \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen.\" However, the user might be expecting a more precise answer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the context starts with \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen\" and then mentions \"Angenommen, Sie möchten Schneckenkörner mit den Eigenschaften verstreuen, wie sie in der nachstehenden Streutabelle wiedergegeben sind.\" Then it refers to \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen\" as the product. The table is for that product. So the specific type is \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen.\" There's no mention of a different type or variant. Therefore, the answer should be \"Delicia Schnecken Linsen.\"\n</think>\n\nDelicia Schnecken Linsen",

The user is asking for the minimum 'baud rate' for the 'RS 232 connection' based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what baud rate is. Baud rate refers to the rate at which data is transferred, measured in bits per second. However, the context given here is in German, so I need to parse through the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about the RS 232 connection. The relevant part mentions: \"Das externe System und das Steuersystem des Streuers mit dem IsoMatch-Bedienpult kommunizieren untereinander über einen seriellen Anschluss (sogenannte RS 232-Verbindung). Dieser Anschluss befindet sich auf der Rückseite der Bedieneinheit. Die Kontaktbelegung der des 9-poligen RS 232-Steckers und die benötigten Einstellungen finden Sie in → der Gebrauchsanleitung des Bedienpults IsoMatch.\"\n\nSo, the text talks about the RS 232 connection being a serial connection, and mentions the 9-pin RS 232 connector and the necessary settings found in the IsoMatch operator's manual. However, there's no explicit mention of the baud rate. The question is about the minimum baud rate, but the context doesn't provide any specific numbers related to baud rates. It only refers to the connector type and where to find the settings. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify the baud rate, the correct answer would be that the information isn't found in the provided text. The user might be expecting a standard baud rate like 9600, but without explicit mention in the context, I can't assume that.

Durch Feuchtigkeit in der Luft können ebenfalls Brocken entstehen.\" This translates to not letting the fertilizer stay in the spreader for too long, as moisture can cause chunks. However, the exact maximum size isn't specified here.\n\nAnother part mentions that when filling the spreader, if the distance between the container edge and the ground is more than 1250 mm, the loading platform must be used. But that's about distance, not chunk size. \n\nThe question is about the maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. The context doesn't provide a specific measurement for chunk size in millimeters.

The user is asking about the type of universal grease recommended for all lubricating nipples.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context is in German, so I'll need to parse that carefully. Let me scan through the text for mentions of grease or lubrication.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section under \"Schmierpunkte\" (Lubrication Points) on page 126. It mentions: \"Alle Schmiernippel der Maschine können mit einer Universalfettsorte geschmiert werden.\" Translating that, it says all lubricating nipples of the machine can be lubricated with a universal grease type. \n\nThen there's a reference to \"Öl- und Fettvolumen\" on page 124 and \"Wartungsintervalle\" on page 125, but those sections aren't provided here. The key sentence is the one about the universal grease type. However, the context doesn't specify the exact type of universal grease, just that a universal grease type is recommended. \n\nThe question asks for the type of universal grease. Since the context doesn't mention a specific brand or type beyond \"Universalfettsorte,\" which translates to \"universal grease type,\" there's no specific name given. The answer should be based strictly on the context provided. Since the exact type isn't specified, the correct response would be that the context doesn't provide that information. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says if unsure, respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" Since the context only mentions that a universal grease type is used but doesn't specify which one, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" However, the user's example might have different expectations. Let me check again.\n\nThe exact sentence is: \"Alle Schmiernippel der Maschine können mit einer Universalfettsorte geschmiert werden.\" So the answer is that a universal grease type is recommended, but the context doesn't specify the exact type. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" because the specific type isn't mentioned. However, the user might expect the answer to be \"Universalfettsorte,\" but that's the term used in the context, not the type. The question asks for the type, which isn't specified. Hence, the correct answer is \"Unknown.\"\n</think>\n\nUnknown",

It mentions that the coupling pieces between the central gear and the spreader gears are used during operations. The text says to apply common lubricating oil to the drive shafts and coupling pieces. It also states that by lubricating the coupling pieces, you can prevent them from corroding and becoming difficult to operate.\n\nSo the answer should specify that the recommended lubricant is \"common lubricating oil\" (gängiges Schmieröl).

The context talks about the function of these covers but not their construction materials. \n\nOther sections mention components like the ExactLine, Auffangbehälter (collection container), and Ablass-Satz (discharge set), but none of these relate to the material of the hopper cover. The question specifically asks about the sail material and UV resistance, which aren't addressed in the provided text. \n\nSince there's no information about the material used for the hopper cover or its UV resistance, the correct response would be that this information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",
