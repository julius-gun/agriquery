These chunks can block the spreader or distort the spreading pattern.\n· When working under moist weather conditions, use a hopper cover that closes well.\n· Do not spread without a hopper cover under moist conditions.\n· Never leave the fertiliser for a long period of time in the spreader. Chunks can also be formed through moisture in the air.\n· Always clean the spreader well after use, including the dosing openings and the discharge bushings.\nYou will most likely get into contact with the fertiliser and other material you may wish to spread while filling, adjusting and testing the spreader. Wear protective clothing and gloves, read the safety instructions provided by the supplier and follow their directions. Contact with these materials could cause physical harm.\nBe careful that nothing gets jammed\nIt is easy for parts to get jammed while adjusting and checking the spreader.\nWork safely while checking and adjusting:\n· switching off the electronic control system,\n· switch the tractor off and remove the key from the ignition,\n· engage the parking brake of the tractor,\n· wait for all machine parts to come to a standstill before you start with the adjustments,\n· wear protective clothing, such as safety gloves and shoes,\n· carefully follow the instructions given.\nFriction with these materials could cause physical injury.\nThe distance between the discharge bushing and the spreading disc must be 1.0 mm.\nIf the distance is too great, the fertiliser does not flow through the discharge point opening onto the spreading disc but onto a random point below the discharge bushing. This results in a disrupted spreading pattern.\nIf the distance is too short, a full hopper may rest partly on the spreading disc, which seriously damages the machine as a result.\n Attach the empty machine and raise it to working height (75 cm).\n Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n Place heavy, stable supports under the ends of the lifting arms.\n Lower the arms onto the supports. Now the machine cannot drop accidentally.\n Switch the tractor off, remove the key from the ignition and engage the parking brake of the tractor.\n Measure the distance between the spreading disc and the discharge bushing.\nYou can use a feeler gauge to measure short distances accurately.\nIf the measured distance is more or less than 1.0 mm, do the following:\n Remove the dashboard by loosening the 3 fixing knobs.\n Turn the lock nuts on the 4 fastening bolts with which the dosing mechanism is attached to the hopper a few times to loosen them.\n Move the discharge bushing upwards or downwards until the distance to the spreading disc is 1.0 mm.\nYou can also put 1.0 mm thick plates between the discharge bush and the spreading disc and lower the discharge bush onto them.\n Turn on the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.\n Check the height again and adjust it if necessary.\n Lower the dosing mechanism by turning the fastening bolt nuts upward.\nLower the dosing mechanism until the bayonet ring has moved halfway across the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the star.\n Check the position of the dosing mechanism relative to the agitator axle. The distance between the agitator axle and the sealing ring must be the same on all sides.\n===Page 166===\n\nMaintenance\n[Image]\nChecking and setting the dosing mechanism\n167\nThe dosing mechanism is now higher than the spreading disc and discharge bushing. Turn the dosing mechanism upwards until you have good access to the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.\n Unscrew the bolts attaching the discharge bush to the star a few times.\n Move the discharge bushing upwards or downwards until the distance to the spreading disc is 1.0 mm.\nYou can also put 1.0 mm thick plates between the discharge bush and the spreading disc and lower the discharge bush onto them.\n Turn on the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the agitator axle star.\n Check the height again and adjust it if necessary.\n Lower the dosing mechanism by turning the fastening bolt nuts upward.\nLower the dosing mechanism until the bayonet ring has moved halfway across the bolts attaching the discharge bushing to the star.\n Check the position of the dosing mechanism relative to the agitator axle.

                    "model_answer": "The exact spreading pattern is determined by the ExactLine system. The ExactLine system measures the distribution of fertiliser granules with a high degree of accuracy.\nA tray test checks the distribution of the fertiliser in the spreader. The results of this test will indicate if you can improve the settings of the spreader, thereby improving the distribution of fertiliser and limiting loss.\nThe spreading pattern is normally a triangle that completely overlaps. A trapezium shape on very large working widths could cause the spreading patterns to overlap the most.\nA tray test can be performed by specialised companies, but it is also possible to perform this test on your own. You will have to purchase some materials for it, however.\nThe ExactLine system provides a very good border spreading pattern with an optimal balance between profit and the environment.\nThe ExactLine has 'environment' and 'yield' settings for precisely adjusting border spreading.\n[Image]\n165\n===Page 166===\n\nTo be done before spreading\nDetermining distribution\n[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\nThe distribution is the ratio of granules with different diameters. A distribution meter comes with every spreader. This meter has 4 sections, with seven parts. The seven have different mesh width that divide the fertiliser granules, based on their diameters.\nDistribution of 0-70-30-0 indicates none of the granules has a diameter of less than 2.0 mm, 70% have a diameter between 2.0 - 3.3 mm and none is larger than 4.75 mm.\nYou should therefore do the following to determine the distribution of the fertiliser with the distribution meter:\n Fill the slot that reads 4.75 mm and close the other openings with the cover.\n Close the distribution meter with the cover and keep it on its side.\n Shake it for as long as no more smaller granules are falling through the sieves.\n Turn the distribution meter back up and read the content of each slot. The given percentages should add up to 100%. It could be necessary to round the readings off with small and round granules.\nTIP Fill the fraction meter from another part of the hopper in order to obtain a good average as the larger granules tend to roll to the outer part of the hopper.\nTIP Clean the seven parts regularly in order to prevent them from getting blocked.\n[Image]\nThe last figure indicates how you can read the following distribution: 0-70-30-0\nIndication with regard to the distribution:\n· If the diameter of 10% or more of the fertiliser granules is smaller than 2.0 mm, the fertiliser type would be difficult to spread, especially with large working widths. This could result in a less than optimal distribution and could damage the crops.\n· If the diameter of 80 - 100% of the fertiliser granules is between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertiliser would be good to spread, irrespective of the size of the remaining granules.\n· If the diameter of 20% or more of the fertiliser granules is greater than 4.75 mm it would be difficult for optimum distribution. This could lead to damage to the crops as the granules could make holes in the leaves of the crop.\n167\n===Page 168===\n\nDetermining similar weight\n[Image]\nFinding the correct spreading chart\n168\nThe density is the weight (kg) of 1 litre of fertiliser and it is expressed as kg/litre or ton/m3.\nThe following material is required to determine the density:\n· measuring beaker (supplied),\n· scale (supplied).\n Refer to the scale manual.\nWorking method to determine similar weight:\n Hang the empty and dry measuring beaker on the scale.\n Press the scale to 0.\n Fill the measuring beaker.\n Knock the measuring beaker 5 times on firm ground.\n Weigh the fertiliser.\n Repeat the steps above three times in order to determine the average weight.\nDensity of at least 1 kg/l is desirable for a good distribution of the fertiliser. Lighter types of fertiliser would be more difficult to spread and the maximum working width would be limited.\nOn the basis of the data you collected about your fertiliser, for the spreading chart of fertiliser with the best comparable properties and desired working width in the table of contents of your spreading chart book, or fill in the data through the online spreading chart service on the website or via the free application (App) for mobile phones.  see paragraph »Online spreading chart service« on page 61.\nYou can find the settings for the spreader, based on the application rate and the driving speed.\n See then paragraph »Setting the spreader« on page 62.\nTIP the page indicated in the table of index of the spreading chart book indicates the settings for",
