The user is asking, \"What system continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread?\" I need to find the exact answer from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for any mention of systems that measure fertilizer quantity. The context is in German, so I need to be careful with the terms. Let me look for keywords like \"mess\" (measure), \"system,\" \"fertilizer,\" or \"quantity.\"\n\nLooking at the first few pages, there's a mention of \"Wägefühler\" which translates to \"weight sensors\" or \"weighing sensors.\" The context says, \"Durch Wägefühler misst der Streuer ständig die Auslassgeschwindigkeit...\" which means \"Through weighing sensors, the spreader continuously measures the discharge speed...\" Wait, the question is about measuring the quantity of fertilizer being spread, not just the discharge speed. But maybe the system mentioned here is related.\n\nFurther down, on page 31, there's a section about \"Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min)\" which is \"Discharge speed (kg/min).\" The context explains that the computer calculates the required discharge speed based on working width, speed, and application rate. Then it mentions that the spreader uses weighing cells to measure the amount of fertilizer being spread. The exact sentence is: \"Der Streuer misst durch die Wägezellen ständig die Menge Kunstdünger, die verstreut wird.\" Translating that: \"The spreader measures through the weighing cells the amount of fertilizer being spread continuously.\"\n\nSo the system here is the \"Wägezellen\" which are weighing cells. The answer should be the weighing cells or the system that uses them. The question asks for the system, so the answer is the weighing cells system. Let me check if there's another mention. On page 30, there's a mention of \"Referenzsensor\" (reference sensor), but that's for correcting measurements, not the main system. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the weighing cells (Wägezellen) system. The answer should be concise, so \"Wägezellen\" or \"weighing cells.\" Since the context uses \"Wägezellen,\" the precise answer is \"Wägezellen.\"\n</think>\n\nWägezellen",

The user is asking how the tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information. The context is in German, so I'll have to parse through the text carefully. \n\nLooking at the sections about the IsoMatch and ISOBUS, there's a part on page 32 that mentions non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch. It says that if the tractor lacks ISOBUS communication, you can use an IsoMatch power supply cable set to add ISOBUS communication. Then, the tractor's speed is transmitted via ISOBUS to IsoMatch.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. The context says that if the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS, you can install the IsoMatch power supply cable set. Once that's done, the speed is sent through ISOBUS. So the answer would involve using that cable set to enable ISOBUS, allowing speed transmission.\n\nAnother part on page 32 mentions that the speed sensor or adapter cable from the tractor's electronics is connected to IsoMatch. So, the method is connecting the speed sensor via the adapter cable to the IsoMatch. \n\nPutting it together: If the tractor lacks ISOBUS, install the IsoMatch power supply cable set to enable ISOBUS, then connect the speed sensor via adapter cable to IsoMatch. But the exact answer needs to be precise. The context says \"Wenn auf Ihrem Schlepper die ISOBUS Kommunikation fehlt, können Sie diese durch einem IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz anbringen.\" Then, \"Die Fahrgeschwindigkeit Ihres Schleppers... wird über den ISOBUS an IsoMatch durchgegeben.\" So the answer is using the IsoMatch power supply cable set to enable ISOBUS, allowing speed transmission. But the question is about how the speed is transmitted when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that you use the IsoMatch power supply cable set to add ISOBUS, then the speed is sent via ISOBUS. But the direct answer from the context is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after using the cable set. However, the exact answer might be that the speed is transmitted via the ISOBUS after enabling it with the cable set. But the user wants the exact info from the context. Let me check again.\n\nIn the context, on page 32: \"Wenn auf Ihrem Schlepper die ISOBUS Kommunikation fehlt, können Sie diese durch einem IsoMatch Stromversorgungskabelsatz anbringen. Anschließend ist Ihr Schlepper vollständig ISOBUS-gerüstet und Sie können die Maschine mit dem IsoMatch Bedienpult anschließen und bedienen. Die Fahrgeschwindigkeit Ihres Schleppers (oder der gezogenen Maschine) wird über den ISOBUS an IsoMatch durchgegeben.\" So the answer is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after using the IsoMatch power supply cable set. Therefore, the precise answer is that the tractor's speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after installing the IsoMatch power supply cable set. But the question is how to transmit the speed when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that you use the IsoMatch power supply cable set to enable ISOBUS, then the speed is sent via ISOBUS. So the answer is: Connect the speed sensor via the adapter cable to the IsoMatch after installing the IsoMatch power supply cable set. Wait, but the context says that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS once the cable set is installed. So the answer is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after enabling ISOBUS with the cable set. But the exact answer from the context is that the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS once the IsoMatch power supply cable set is used. Therefore, the answer is: The tractor's driving speed is transmitted via ISOBUS after installing the IsoMatch power supply cable set. But the question is how to transmit the speed when there's no ISOBUS. The answer is that you use the IsoMatch power supply cable set to enable ISOBUS, then the speed is sent via ISOBUS.

Let me check that part again. \n\nIn the context, under \"Das Bedienpult\" (The Control Box), it says: \"Mit dem Hauptschalter (links oben im roten Rand) schalten Sie das Bedienpult ein oder aus.\" Translating that, it means the main switch is located \"left top in the red border.\" So the exact location is \"links oben im roten Rand\" which translates to \"left top in the red border\" or \"top left corner of the red border.\"\n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of a main switch elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, like Page 35 about the IsoMatch Griff, it talks about buttons but not a main switch. The technical data pages (36-37) don't mention the switch location. \n\nSo the answer should be that the main switch is located in the top left corner of the red border on the control box. The answer needs to be precise and directly from the context. The user wants the exact information, so I should replicate the exact phrase from the context if possible. However, the instruction says to answer in English.

But since the user wants the answer in English, I need to translate that. The exact phrase from the context is \"Hauptschalter (links oben im roten Rand)\" which translates to \"Main switch (top left in the red border).\" \n\nSo the answer should be: \"Top left in the red border of the control box.\" But to match the exact wording from the context, maybe \"left top in the red border\" is the direct translation.

Let me check that part again.\n\nOn page 43, under \"Schaufeln\" (Vanes), there's a section that says: \"Ziehen Sie die Sicherungsmuttern an (50 Nm)\" which translates to \"Tighten the lock nuts to (50 Nm)\". This seems directly relevant. \n\nI should confirm if \"Sicherungsmuttern\" refers to the lock nuts mentioned in the question. The term \"Sicherungsmutter\" is indeed a lock nut, so this is the correct information. \n\nNo other parts of the context mention torque values for lock nuts. The answer is straightforward here. The exact value is 50 NM. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of torque elsewhere. Scanning through other pages, like page 44 or 48, there's no additional torque specifications for lock nuts. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 50 NM.\n</think>\n\n50 Nm",

Looking at the pages, on page 46, there's a section titled \"Anschlusspunkt Gelenkwelle\" which talks about the working width being determined by the speed of the spreader disc. The text says, \"Die Arbeitsbreite der Maschine wird in erster Linie durch die Drehzahl der Streuscheibe bestimmt.\" So that's a direct mention. \n\nThen, further down the same page, it mentions that the spreader table (Streutabelle) specifies the Gelenkwelle connection point, which also relates to the working width. The exact sentence is: \"Die (Online-)Streutabelle schreibt den Anschlusspunkt der Gelenkwelle vor.\" \n\nI need to check if there's any other mention. On page 49, there's a part about the hydraulic boundary spreader, but that seems related to positioning rather than the working width. The main points are the spreader disc's RPM and the spreader table's settings. \n\nSo the answer should state that the working width is primarily determined by the spreader disc's RPM, which is influenced by the drive shaft speed and the selected Gelenkwelle connection point. Also, the spreader table specifies the connection point. But the question is about what determines the working width, so the primary factor is the spreader disc's RPM. The answer should be concise, so I'll extract the exact sentences from the context.\n</think>\n\nThe machine's working width is primarily determined by the rotational speed of the spreader disc, which depends on the drive shaft speed and the selected Gelenkwelle connection point.  \n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

Der Abstand zwischen der Maschine und der Plattform darf maximal 200 mm betragen.\" So, when moving the machine to the platform, the distance between the machine and the platform must be at most 200 mm. \n\nBut the question is about the spreader (which is part of the machine) and the loading platform. The context doesn't explicitly mention the spreader's distance from the platform. However, the maximum distance mentioned is 200 mm between the machine and the platform.

Wait, the line for M18 is:\n\n7                         M18                         90                     110                     250                     290                      350                      420                      410                      490\n\nWait, the numbers might be for different friction coefficients. The first number is for 0.10, then 0.13, then 0.20? Let me parse the table correctly. The table on page 129 for steel bolts (Stahl) has columns for different friction coefficients. The first column is for 0.10, then 0.13, then 0.20? Wait, the text says:\n\n\"Anzugsmomente für Schrauben und Muttern mit gerändelter Unterseite 10 % zusätzlich, wie z. B.:\n· Tensilock (K100),\n· Whizlock.\"\n\nBut the main table for M18 is:\n\nFor M18, the line is:\n\n7                         M18                         90                     110                     250                     290                      350                      420                      410                      490\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are for different friction coefficients. The first number (90) is for 0.10, then 110 for 0.13, then 250 for 0.20? But the text mentions that the 0.10 is for oiled, and 0.13 for dry. So for M18, the torque for 0.13 friction would be 110 Nm? But the user is asking for 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction. Wait, the quality (10.9) is part of the bolt's specification. The table on page 129 for steel bolts includes different qualities. Wait, the table on page 129 for steel bolts (Stahl) has entries for different qualities. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the exact text from page 129:\n\n\"Anzugsmomente Stahl\nRichtlinien für Anzugsmomente (in Nm) für selbstsichernde Muttern, Sechskantschrauben und -muttern.\n.\n   Qualität.Reibung *.Gewinde Anzugsmomente.4.6.0,10",

The context has several pages, and the question is about torque values. Let me scan through the pages.\n\nLooking at Page 130, there's a section about \"Anzugsmomente Edelstahl\" which translates to torque values for stainless steel. The table there lists different torque values for various bolt sizes and friction coefficients. \n\nThe question specifies a M6 bolt with 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction. In the table on Page 130, under the Edelstahl section, for M6, the entry for 0.2 friction is 9.9 Nm. The table entries are structured with quality, friction, and then the torque values for different sizes. \n\nI need to confirm that the 70 (A2) quality corresponds to the correct row. The table lists for 70 (A2) with 0.10 and 0.20 friction. The 0.20 friction value for M6 is 9.9 Nm. \n\nSo the answer should be 9.9 Nm. I should check if there's any other mention of M6 in other pages, but given the context, Page 130 is the relevant one. The user's question matches the M6 entry here.

There's no mention of temperature here. \n\nFurther down, on page 79, there's a part about not using the spreader during rain or high air humidity. Again, temperature isn't specified. The context doesn't mention anything about the temperature range for the tray test. The question is about 40°C, which is a specific temperature. Since the context doesn't discuss temperature restrictions for the test, the answer would be that it's not mentioned, so the correct response is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\"\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

First, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of hydraulic systems and their actuation methods.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections about hydraulic border spreading plates, like on pages 84-88. The key part is when they mention the ExactLine. On page 89, there's a section about testing the ExactLine. The context says, \"Bedienen Sie das hydraulische Steuergerät einige Sekunden...\" which translates to operating the hydraulic control device. It also mentions a hydraulic steering device and a gas accumulator. However, there's no mention of pneumatic actuation. \n\nAnother part on page 85 talks about the hydraulic border spreading plate and mentions adjusting the plate using the Streutabelle, but again, no mention of pneumatic systems. The entire context refers to hydraulic systems, like the hydraulic control device and the hydraulic steering device. There's no indication that pneumatic actuation is used. \n\nSince the question is about whether it can be actuated pneumatically, and the context only discusses hydraulic systems without any reference to pneumatic, the answer should be that it's not mentioned, so the answer is \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" But the user's instructions say to respond with \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure.

The context is in German, so I need to look for keywords like \"Umwelt\" (environment), \"Norm\" (standard), \"Verlust\" (loss), and \"Graben\" (ditch). \n\nLooking at Page 87, there's a mention of \"Umweltnorm\" which translates to \"environmental standard.\" The text says, \"Der maximal zulässige Verlust im Graben ist in der Umweltnorm festgelegt.\" That directly translates to \"The maximum allowable loss in the ditch is determined by the environmental standard.\" \n\nAnother reference is on Page 91, which also mentions \"Umweltnorm\" and the same context about the maximum loss. So the answer should be \"Umweltnorm\" or \"environmental standard.\" The question asks for the standard, so the answer is the Umweltnorm. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other standard mentioned.

The context is in German, so I need to be careful with the translations. Let me look for keywords like \"stop,\" \"stop spreading,\" or related terms.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section under \"Einsatz auf dem Feld\" (Field operation) on page 101. It mentions: \"Im Fall der Störung oder Verstopfung des Streuers:  Das Streuen unverzüglich einstellen!  Die Zapfwelle sofort abstellen!\" Translating that, it says: \"In case of disturbance or clogging of the spreader:  Immediately stop spreading!  Immediately stop the power take-off (PTO) shaft!\"\n\nAdditionally, there's another part on page 103 under \"Vorgewende streuen ohne GEOCONTROL\" (Spreading the Vorgewende without GEOCONTROL) which says: \" Stoppen Sie das Streuen, indem Sie die Dosiereinheiten der Maschine schließen, wenn Sie noch eine halbe Arbeitsbreite vom Parzellenende entfernt sind.\" Translating that: \" Stop spreading by closing the dosing units of the machine when you are still half a working width away from the field end.\"\n\nAnother mention is on page 104 under \"Ohne GEOCONTROL\": \" Fahren Sie so dicht wie möglich bis zum Parzellenende durch und stoppen Sie das Streuen, indem Sie die Dosiereinheiten schließen, genau bevor Sie wenden.\" Which translates to: \" Drive as close as possible to the field end and stop spreading by closing the dosing units exactly before turning.\"\n\nSo the main steps are: close the dosing units when approaching the end of the field, and stop the PTO shaft if there's a disturbance or clogging. The answer needs to be precise and concise, so combining these points, the answer would involve closing the dosing units and stopping the PTO shaft.\n</think>\n\nTo stop spreading the fertilizer, close the dosing units of the machine when approaching the field end and immediately stop the power take-off (PTO) shaft in case of disturbance or clogging.",

First, I need to find the relevant information in the provided context.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about \"Über- und unterdosieren\" (Over- and under-dosing) on page 105. It mentions that the spreader has two different working methods for headland spreading: Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen (single-shaft headland spreading) with the hydraulic border spreader and Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen (double-shaft headland spreading) with ExactLine. \n\nBut the question is about the maximum height the fertilizer flies. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The term \"height\" here might refer to the spread pattern's reach or the distance from the field edge. Let me check again.\n\nIn the section about Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen on page 107, there's a mention of Richtung X (1) (Umweltstellung) and Richtung (9) (Ertragsstellung). It says that in Richtung X, you spread less towards the field edge, resulting in less loss over the field edge, and in Richtung (9), you spread more towards the field edge, improving filling but with higher loss. However, this seems to relate to the direction of spreading, not the height.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the maximum height of the fertilizer application, like the vertical distance from the ground. But the context doesn't mention anything about the height of the fertilizer being spread. It talks about the spread pattern, overlap, and dosing adjustments, but not the vertical height. \n\nLooking through other sections, there's a mention of the spreader's working width and the overlap percentage, but again, nothing about the height. The user might be referring to the maximum distance the fertilizer can be spread from the field edge, which is related to the border spreading methods. However, the exact term \"maximum height\" isn't used. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific numerical values for the maximum height of fertilizer flight, and the question might be based on a misunderstanding or a term that's not directly addressed in the text, the answer would be that the information isn't found in the context.

For example, there's mention of \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen\" (single-disc border spreading) using a hydraulic border spreading plate and \"Zweischeiben-Grenzstreuen\" (double-disc border spreading) with ExactLine. However, the term \"seven-sided\" doesn't appear anywhere in the text. \n\nThe context talks about different configurations like using a hydraulic border spreading plate for single-disc spreading, adjusting positions for environmental or yield settings, and specific procedures for setting up the equipment. But there's no reference to a seven-sided method. The closest terms are \"Einscheiben\" (single disc) and \"Zweischeiben\" (double disc), which relate to the number of discs used, not sides.\n\nSince the question mentions a seven-sided boundary spreading, which isn't covered in the provided context, the correct response would be that the information isn't found.

The question is about measures for road transport when stopping work, so I should look for sections that mention stopping work and then the necessary steps for road transport.\n\nLooking through the pages, on Page 112 under \"Beendigung der Arbeiten\" (Ending the Work), there's a list of steps to take directly after work. The user is asking specifically about road transport measures, so I need to check if any of these steps relate to that.\n\nIn the context, under \"Beendigung der Arbeiten\" on Page 112, the steps include: closing the dosing units, turning off the drive shaft, switching off the electronic control system, turning off the tractor and removing the key, applying the parking brake, freeing the machine from crop residue, earth, and stones, securing the cover tarp, and taking all relevant measures for road transport. The last point explicitly mentions \"Ergreifen Sie sämtliche diesbezüglich geltenden Maßnahmen für den Straßentransport.\" which translates to \"Take all applicable measures for road transport.\"\n\nSo the answer should include that specific instruction. The user wants the answer to be precise and concise, so the exact phrase from the context is \"Ergreifen Sie sämtliche diesbezüglich geltenden Maßnahmen für den Straßentransport.\" However, since the answer needs to be in English, I should translate that part. The instruction is to take all applicable measures for road transport. But the exact wording in the context is in German, so maybe the answer should reflect that exact phrase as per the instructions. Wait, the user's answer format requires the answer to be in English, as per the instructions. So the answer should be in English, but the exact information from the context.

However, the question is about paint, not oil. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mention of paint in the context. Let me check again. The context mentions \"Konservierungsmittel (mitgeliefert)\" which is a preservative medium, possibly a spray. But the user is asking about paint. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the context doesn't specify a particular paint, but mentions using a preservative spray.

However, the question is about paint for damaged paintwork. The context doesn't explicitly mention paint, but maybe the preservative medium is a type of paint or coating. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the context doesn't specify a specific paint, but the user should use the provided preservative medium. \n\nWait, the question is about \"paint\" but the context refers to a preservative medium. However, the user might be referring to a protective coating. Since the context doesn't mention a specific paint, but does mention using the provided preservative medium, perhaps the answer is that the specific paint is the provided preservative medium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the context doesn't specify a particular paint, but the user should use the provided preservative medium. However, the question is about paint, so maybe the answer is that the context doesn't mention a specific paint. \n\nWait, the exact text says \"sprühen (blanke) Metallteile der Maschine mit Konservierungsmittel (mitgeliefert) zum Schutz vor Korrosion der Maschine ein.\" So, the Konservierungsmittel is a preservative medium, not paint. Therefore, the context doesn't mention a specific paint for damaged paintwork. \n\nBut the user's question is about paint.

It mentions that the manual is for trained farmers and others who are trained for agricultural work, authorized by national legislation, and have knowledge of assembly work. \n\nThen, under \"Person\" on Page 10, there's a part about the user's responsibility. It states that the user must be familiar with basic safety regulations and work environment regulations, traffic regulations, informed about working with the machine and associated dangers, have read and understood the manual, and be familiar with all systems and control elements and their functions. \n\nAdditionally, on Page 11 under \"Befugnis\" (Authorization), it says that a person is authorized if they have completed the required training by state authorities and take responsibility as outlined in the \"Person\" section on Page 10. \n\nPutting this together, the training program must include understanding safety regulations, work environment regulations, traffic regulations, machine operation dangers, familiarity with the machine's systems and controls, and completing state-mandated training. The exact curriculum isn't listed in detail, but the key points are the required knowledge areas and authorization through state training.\n</think>\n\nThe curriculum includes completing state-mandated training, understanding safety regulations, work environment regulations, traffic regulations, machine operation dangers, and familiarity with systems/control elements.

On page 5, there's a mention of symbols used for notes and warnings. However, the key part is in the \"Sicherheit\" (Safety) section. \n\nOn page 10, under \"Sicherheitsvorschriften\" (Safety Regulations), there's a line that says: \"Alle in dem Text angegebenen Richtungshinweise gehen stets von der Fahrtrichtung aus.\" Wait, that's about direction hints, not standards. \n\nWait, maybe looking at the \"Warnaufkleber\" (Warning Stickers) on page 7. It mentions that the warnings are part of the safety measures but doesn't specify a standard. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is in the \"Zeichenschlüssel\" section. On page 5, there's a note that says \"Alle in dem Text angegebenen Richtungshinweise gehen stets von der Fahrtrichtung aus.\" Hmm, that's about direction, not standards. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is related to ISO standards. The user is asking for an international standard. The context mentions \"ISO-Bediensystem\" on page 13. \"ISO-Bediensystem\" translates to \"ISO Operating System\" or \"ISO Control System\". But that's about the system, not the pictograms. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is ISO 14119 or another standard related to safety symbols.

The user is asking how the corrosion rate on the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD compares between machines used in coastal areas versus inland agricultural regions. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any information related to corrosion and the environments mentioned. The context is a manual for a machine, so it's likely discussing maintenance, safety, and operational guidelines.\n\nLooking through the pages, I see a section under \"Wartung\" (Maintenance) and \"Sicherheit\" (Safety). There's a mention of protecting the machine from corrosion. Specifically, there's a part that says: \"Kunstdünger und andere Salze haben großen Einfluss auf die Korrosionsgeschwindigkeit.\" Translating that, it means \"Artificial fertilizers and other salts have a significant influence on the corrosion rate.\" \n\nThe context also mentions that after completing work, the container should be emptied. But the key point here is that salts (like those from fertilizers) affect corrosion. Now, coastal areas typically have higher salt content in the air due to sea spray, while inland areas might have less. However, the context doesn't explicitly compare coastal vs. inland. It only states that salts (from fertilizers) influence corrosion. \n\nWait, the question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD specifically. The context mentions \"Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD\" in the section about the machine's general information. But the corrosion part is in the maintenance section. The manual doesn't directly compare coastal and inland regions. It only states that salts (from fertilizers) affect corrosion. \n\nSo, the answer would need to be based on the given context. Since the context doesn't mention coastal vs. inland regions, but rather the effect of salts (from fertilizers) on corrosion, the answer might be that the corrosion rate is influenced by the presence of salts, which could be more prevalent in coastal areas. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that coastal areas have more salts. \n\nWait, the user's question is about the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD's corrosion rate in coastal vs. inland. The context says that artificial fertilizers and other salts affect corrosion. But it doesn't specify where these salts come from. However, in agricultural regions, especially coastal ones, the use of fertilizers might be combined with salt from the environment. But the manual doesn't make that comparison. \n\nSince the context doesn't directly compare coastal and inland regions, but only mentions that salts (from fertilizers) influence corrosion, the answer would have to be based on that. However, the user's question is about the comparison between the two regions. Since the context doesn't provide that specific comparison, the answer would be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context.\" \n\nWait, but the context does mention that salts (from fertilizers) affect corrosion. If coastal areas have more salt in the air (due to sea spray), then the corrosion rate would be higher there. But the manual doesn't explicitly state that. The answer must be based strictly on the context. Since the context doesn't mention coastal vs. inland, but only that salts affect corrosion, the answer would be that the corrosion rate is influenced by the presence of salts, but the context doesn't compare coastal and inland regions.

The exact sentence is: \"Die meisten Sorten Kunstdünger ziehen Wasser an und können dann große Brocken bilden.\" Translating that, it says most fertilizer types absorb water and can form large chunks. However, the context doesn't specify the maximum chunk size in millimeters. \n\nAnother part on page 75 mentions that when filling during spreading, you need to turn off automatic calibration because the weight measurement might be incorrect if the spreader is being filled.

On page 94, there's a section about working in a closed cabin. The relevant part says: \"Arbeiten Sie daher in einer geschlossenen Kabine mit einem Aktivkohlefilter in den Lufteinlässen.\" Translating that, it mentions using an \"Aktivkohlefilter\" in the air intakes of the closed cabin. \n\nThe question specifies \"active carbon filters,\" and \"Aktivkohlefilter\" directly translates to active carbon filters.

It just states the need for an active carbon filter in the cabin's air intakes. \n\nI need to ensure there's no other mention elsewhere. Checking other pages, like page 95 about machine setup, and others, but nothing else about filters.

So the answer should be \"common lubricating oil.\" But let me check again. \n\nWait, the context mentions \"gängiges Schmieröl\" for connectors. The question is about the type of lubricant recommended for connectors to prevent corrosion. The context doesn't mention corrosion specifically, but the lubricant type is \"gängiges Schmieröl.\" However, in the section about the central gear, they specify Getriebefett EP 00/000. But for connectors, it's general lubricating oil. \n\nSo the answer is \"common lubricating oil\" as per the context. But the user might want the exact term from the context.

Again, no mention of screwdrivers. \n\nLooking through other sections, there's a lot about torque values, safety precautions, and tools like wrenches or specific parts, but nothing about screwdriver types. The context does mention using a \"Stab\" (rod) for hydraulic system checks, but that's not relevant here. \n\nSince there's no direct information about the screwdriver type required for adjusting the dosing mechanism in the context, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions.

The user is asking about the typical lifespan of the agitator's seal ring in operational hours before it needs replacement.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of the seal ring's lifespan. The context is mostly about maintenance procedures, torque values, hydraulic systems, and safety precautions. \n\nLooking through the pages, I see on page 134 there's a section about the agitator's seal ring. The text mentions that the seal ring must be free from the agitator shaft. But that's about installation, not lifespan. \n\nThen, on page 135, there's a part about adjusting the dosing plates and checking the gap between the agitator shaft and the seal ring. It says if the gap isn't equal, you need to adjust the dosing plates. Still no mention of lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The context mentions that hydraulic hoses have a maximum lifespan of 6 years, but that's for hoses, not the seal ring. \n\nLooking at the maintenance instructions, there's a part about replacing hydraulic hoses if they're damaged or aged, but again, that's about hoses. The seal ring isn't specifically mentioned in terms of operational hours or lifespan. \n\nThe question is about the seal ring's lifespan in hours. Since the context doesn't provide any specific number related to the seal ring's operational hours before replacement, the answer would be that it's not found in the context. \n\nI should make sure there's no other mention. Let me scan through all the pages again. No, there's no direct information about the seal ring's lifespan in hours. The closest is the hydraulic hose lifespan, but that's different. Therefore, the correct response is that the information isn't found in the context.\n</think>\n\nNot found in context",

First, I need to understand what exactly they're referring to. The term 'small crack of light' might be a translation or a specific term used in the context of the dosing baffles. \n\nLooking at the provided context, there are several pages discussing maintenance and adjustments of hydraulic systems and dosing mechanisms. The key sections are around pages 133 to 139. Let me scan through those.\n\nOn page 135, there's a section about adjusting the dosing plates. It mentions that when the dosing openings are closed, you should still see a small gap between the plates. The exact phrase is: \"Wenn die Dosierscheiben in der korrekten Position montiert sind, dann können Sie, wenn die Dosieröffnungen geschlossen sind, noch einen kleinen Spalt sehen.\" Translating that, it says that if the dosing discs are correctly positioned, you can still see a small gap when the dosing openings are closed.\n\nNow, the question is about the dimension of this small gap. The user is asking for the exact measurement in millimeters. Let me check the context again for any mention of specific measurements. \n\nLooking through the pages again, on page 136, there's a mention of the distance between the inside of the draw rope and the outlet pipe opening needing to be 109 mm. However, that's related to the spreader plates, not the dosing baffles. \n\nOn page 138, there's a part about the distance between the outlet pipe and the spreader plate needing to be 1.0 mm. But again, that's a different component. \n\nWait, the user is specifically asking about the 'small crack of light' between the dosing baffles when closed. The context mentions a small gap when the dosing openings are closed, but does it specify the dimension? Let me check again. \n\nIn the section on page 135, the text says that when the dosing openings are closed, you can still see a small gap. However, there's no explicit mention of the measurement in millimeters. The other parts mention distances like 109 mm and 1.0 mm, but those are for different parts. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide a specific measurement for the small gap between the dosing baffles, the answer would be that it's not found in the context.

It's a tool used to measure small gaps, typically made of thin metal blades. But the question is about the material recommended specifically for the discharge bushing height check.\n\nLooking through the provided context, I remember there was a mention of a feeler gauge in the maintenance sections. Let me scan through the pages again. \n\nOn page 138, under the section \"Kontrolle und Einstellung Höhe Auslaufrohr\", there's a note that says: \"Mit einer Fühlerlehre können Sie kleine Abstände genau messen.\" The term \"Fühlerlehre\" translates to feeler gauge.
