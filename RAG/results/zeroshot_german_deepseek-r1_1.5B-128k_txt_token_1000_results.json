Then later, it says that if you want a fine application, you can close one of the three openings. So during a fine application, only one opening is closed.\n\nWait, but in the initial text, it's about Feindosieren, which might be a typo for Feindosierung. The user provided two images: Hebel Feindosierung Stellung normal dosieren and feindosieren. Each image has two openings closed. So during fine application, one opening is closed.\n\nI should make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. \"Dosis\" refers to dosing settings, while \"Feindosierung\" might be a translation issue.

For GEOSPREAD, it mentions that the maximum spreadable width is 100%, which seems important.\n\nIn Page 29, there's a mention of ExactLine, but I'm not sure if that affects the overlap percentage directly.

It talks about measuring fuel consumption and ensuring proper dosing. So that's a good sign for fertilizer spread.\n\nThen, on page 30, there's an ISO Bedienungsanleitung discussing how the computer compares required output with set output, using data from a system or a new Parzellengrenze import. This relates to process control in spreading, which might involve measuring quantities.\n\nPage 31 discusses the calculation of fertilizer outflow and the use of automated tests. It mentions that for smaller parzellen (fields), you can reduce the time between measurements. So this ties into continuous measurement as well.\n\nPutting it all together, ExactLine is a system used for fertilizer spreading, continuously measuring quantities through fuel consumption and dosing accuracy. The ISO Bedienungsanleitung also involves process control and measurement. Therefore, the answer should be \"ExactLine\" or \"ISO Bedienungsanleitung.\"\n</think>\n\nThe system that continuously measures fertilizer quantity being spread is **ExactLine**.\n\nAnswer: ExactLine",

That doesn't directly mention calibration tests.\n\nThen, looking further down, there's a part discussing Parzellengrenzen and Vorgewenden. Here, it talks about controlling the width of these areas by adjusting start and stop times. It also mentions using data from a management system or a new parzellengrenze import. \n\nNext, I see that under \"Auslassgeschwindigkeit (kg/min)\", there's some information. The formula is given as: Benötigte Auslauf Geschwindigkeit = Arbeitsbreite (m) x Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) x Ausbringmenge (kg/ha). They mention an automatic braking test with tests done every 75 kg or each minute, which calculates the desired outflow rate. \n\nThey also note that for smaller parcels, a shorter time can be used. There's a section about using the Streutabelle (which I assume is the Streuter data) and automating the braking tests. The computer needs at least one measurement point to calculate this ratio between dosier stand and outflow speed.\n\nAdditionally, there's a part where if the bed volume is under 100 kg, the system switches off automatic calibration. The accuracy of the measurements decreases as bed volume increases because of factors like slope or other influences. They mention using a reference sensor for calibration.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the spreader carries out these tests (braking tests) every 75 kg or each minute.

It mentions that when an application is selected, the last one becomes visible on the screen. The text also discusses the number of USB supports and missing WLAN/WIFI, but it doesn't mention anything about pressing buttons.\n\nThere's another section titled \"ISOMatch Tellus GO\" which describes the main switch button. It says that the switch can be pressed to turn the control box on or off, and it mentions a scrollable menu with options like Scrollrad navigation. However, there's no specific information about how long the button should be pressed.\n\nThe question is asking about the length of the main switch button for turning on/off. Since the context doesn't provide any details on this, I need to infer based on standard controls. Typically, a switch that turns something on or off might require pressing it for a few seconds. It's not specified as needing multiple presses, so maybe just one press is sufficient.\n\nI should also consider if there are any specific instructions in the context about button length.

It says to close the secure ring in the kupplung piece, shift it towards the zapsfelle, and then open the secure ring again.

This section explains that while this system can handle varying doses and uses external controls, it still requires automative calibration for accurate dosing.

Dosierstellung refers to the fertilizer application setup, and Dosieröffnung is the opening for applying it. \n\nLooking further down, there's a part where they explain how to calculate the required flow rate. They mention using the formula: Arbeitsbreite (m) multiplied by Fahrgeschwindigkeit (km/h) multiplied by Ausbringmenge (kg/ha). Then they give an example of 600 kg/min.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if \"Arbeitsbreite\" is spelled correctly. It should be \"Arbeitsbreite,\" which means width in meters.

The example given is 600 kg/min, which seems to be a specific case. So the general formula would be:\n\nFlow rate (kg/min) = Width (m) × Speed (km/h) × Area per hectare (kg/ha)\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident if that's accurate because sometimes flow rates in agriculture are calculated differently. Maybe it's better to stick with what's provided in the context, which is using width, speed, and area.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formula they're referring to is multiplying the width by the speed and then by the area per hectare.\n</think>\n\nThe general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer in kg/min is:\n\nFlow rate (kg/min) = Width (m) × Speed (km/h) × Area per hectare (kg/ha)\n\nThis formula uses the width of the field, the speed at which the fertilizer is applied, and the area covered per hectare to determine the required flow rate.",

It mentions avoiding a strong wind by using an active deck filter. Then it talks about dealing with water and brocks, which can cause body damage.\n\nNext, under \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen,\" the instructions say: \n- Arbeiten bei feuchtem Wetter mit einer gut geschlossenen Abdeckplane.\n- Streuen Sie ohne Abdeckplane nicht bei feuchtem Wetter.\n- Lassen Sie Kunstdünger nie lange im Streuer. \n\nThen, it mentions that after justifying the streuer, you can fill the remaining volume up to a certain height. It also talks about using a machine to load 10 cm over the bed and suggests loading if the height is more than 1250 mm.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section on filling the kabine with water. The steps include:\n- Using a machine to fill the kabine up to a certain height.\n- Filling both handle holders uniformly so they're almost empty at the same time.\n- Using a ladder or other means if necessary.\n\nThe key point here is that when loading manually, you can't just use a platform; you have to ensure the hopper rim is within 1250 mm of the ground. So the maximum distance before needing a platform is 1250 mm.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other instructions related to this.

There are several points mentioned here.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph: \"Arbeiten vor dem Streuen\" translates to \"Arbeit vor dem Streuen.\" It talks about avoiding contact with health workers and others, using protective measures like Schutzklasse und Handschüche. It also mentions reading security notices and following additional instructions. The contact could be due to body-level pollution.\n\nNext, there's a section on the quetschgefahr: \"Achtung Quetschgefahr.\" This indicates that during justification, certain precautions are needed, like discharging the Schlepper and Feststellbremse of the Schleppers. The goal is to prevent damage from the spreader.\n\nThen, it mentions einklemmen, which I think means edentische Leidung or edentrical disease. This refers to body-level infections caused by the spreader. It warns that improper handling can lead to severe health risks.\n\nThe section on fehrlicheSituationen for others in use notes that certain situations could cause health issues during operation and testing, especially related to machinery. It also mentions that external factors like surface water might pose a challenge.\n\nMoving on, \"Schonen Sie die Umwelt\" translates to \"Make the environment nice.\" This part talks about proper dosages and working procedures to prevent environmental damage from spillage or improper distribution of fertilizers.\n\nThe next section is about zapfwelle. It explains that after discharging the Zapfwelle, it can lead to hazards due to the mass load on the machine. It advises holding off until all moving parts are still standing. This could result in serious health risks like encephalohemorrhage or other severe injuries.\n\nFinally, there's a section about spreading the fertilizer test. It mentions that the test should check the distribution of fertilizers to how it's spread by the spreader. Using the results from this test can improve the spreader's performance and reduce losses.\n\nPutting all these together, the tray test is specifically about checking the distribution of fertilizer products after spreading.

It says they need bandmaß (mass band), Wasserwaage for horizontal storage holders, 7 of each, 7 messrohre, 1 trichter, and a notizblock, software bedienung, and various other items like a note block, software instructions, and more.\n\nThe general anweisungen section provides detailed instructions on how to set up the tray test.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the part about the Streumengentest. It says that when using a special Düngemittelsorte, certain conditions apply. Specifically, it mentions two scenarios: one where the Korngrößenverteilung and Dichte match those in the Streutabellenbuch, and another where they don't. Then there's a note about using Kunstdünger of mäßiger Qualität.\n\nNext, for the actual spreading, I see that when conducting the Streumengentest, certain material requirements are listed. The key part here is \"Jährlich den Links-Rechts-Test ausführen,\" which means they perform the test annually to check if the distribution remains consistent between the two streuscheiben.\n\nThe question asks about the maximum wind speed permissible for both tests. Looking at the context, I don't see any mention of wind speed restrictions in this section. The only relevant information is about the Streumengentest itself and the material requirements.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The text does talk about wind speed limits when using special Düngemittelsorte, but it's not directly related to the actual spreading test. It mentions 3 m/s (windstärke 2) as an example for testing, but that's probably specific to a particular scenario.\n\nSo, in the Streumengentest, they specify wind speeds up to 3 m/s. But when talking about the actual spreading, I don't see any mention of wind speed limits. Therefore, it seems like there are no explicit maximum wind speeds mentioned for both tests in this context.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me read through again. The part about the Streumengentest says: \"Führen Sie den Streumengentest bei trockenem Wetter, geringer Luftfeuchtigkeit und einer maximalen Windgeschwindigkeit von 3 m/s (Windstärke 2) aus.\" So that's explicitly stating a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s. However, the actual spreading test doesn't mention any specific wind speed limits.\n\nTherefore, while the Streumengentest has a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s, there isn't an explicit limit mentioned for the actual spreading test in this context. So, I should only include the information from the Streumengentest as per the question's request.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum wind speed permissible for the Streumengentest is 3 m/s.\n\nAnswer: 3 m/s",

The main topic is about streuer testing, which involves factors like the Streuer's strength, speed, and other related parameters. There are two pages mentioned: one with a description of the test for ExactLine and another with an image reference.\n\nThe question is asking what specific height in cm the spreading disc should be set above the troughs before testing the ExactLine pattern. Looking at the context, I see that on page 89, there's a section about the ExactLine test. The text says: \"Stellen Sie den Streuer anhand der Daten aus der Streutabelle der gewünschten Arbeitsbreite ein, die zu den am ehesten vergleichbaren Kunstdünger, Saaten oder Körnern gehört (Höhe Streuscheibe = 75 cm über den Auffangbehältern).\"\n\nSo the key information here is that the height should be set to 75 cm above the troughs. The text also mentions using the data from the Streutabelle, which I assume refers to a specific Streuer table for the desired area.\n\nI need to make sure I'm extracting this exact number: 75 cm. It's important because it directly answers the question without any extra information. Also, since the context is provided in Chinese, but the answer should be in English as per the instructions, I'll present it that way.\n\nI don't see any other relevant details from the context that would affect this answer.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that the context is about hydraulics and spreaders. It mentions something called the \"hydraulischem Grenzstreublech,\" which I think is a type of spreader used in agriculture or farming. The text describes how this spreader works when there's a failure or stoppage.\n\nLooking at the section where it talks about spreading, I see that after spreading, if there's an issue like failure or stoppage, certain steps are taken. There are several actions listed:\n\n1. Carefully extract the EXACT information related to the question.\n2. Keep it concise and precise.\n3. Adhere strictly to instructions.\n\nThe specific actions mentioned are:\n- Stellen Sie das Grenzstreublech nach unten.\n- Schließen Sie die Dosierung.\n- Koppeln Sie den Antrieb der rechten Streuscheibe wieder an.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for two actions. So I need to pick the two most critical ones from these three. The first action is about moving it down, which might be part of the process after spreading. The second action is closing the dosing, and the third is koppelung, which sounds like kipping or knotting.\n\nBut since the question specifies two actions, I should pick the two that are most relevant. Moving it down (stellen sie das Grenzstreublech nach unten) seems to be a step after spreading when failure occurs. Then closing dosing (stellen Sie die Dosierung ab) is another action. Alternatively, kipping might not be necessary if moving it down and closing dosing are the main steps.\n\nWait, but in the text, after spreading, they mention stopping at three points: fixing the Schlepper, ensuring no overlap, and then doing the spread again. Then, when failure occurs, they instruct to move the spreader down (stellen sie das Grenzstreublech nach unten), close dosing (stellen Sie die Dosierung ab), and kippelieren den Antrieb der rechten Streuscheibe (koppeln sie den Antriebspult). So that's three actions, but the question is about two.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving it down is one action, closing dosing is another, and kipping is a third. But since the question asks for two, perhaps moving it down and closing dosing are the key steps when spreader fails or stopspage occurs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after spreading failure, they move the spreader down (stellen sie das Grenzstreublech nach unten) and then close dosing (stellen Sie die Dosierung ab). That would be two actions. The third action is about kipping, which might not be necessary if moving it down and closing dosing are sufficient.\n\nI think the answer should include moving the spreader down and closing dosing as the two main actions when there's a failure or stoppage.\n</think>\n\nstellen Sie das Grenzstreublech nach unten\nstellen Sie die Dosierung ab",

One of those steps is closing the doorpiece, which involves several actions like ensuring the hydraulics are drucklos (drilled), cutting off the electric utilities, shutting down the electronic system, and taking out the sales tax from the tax shield. It also says to shut down all relevant measures for transportation.\n\nOn page 113, there's a section about avoiding contact with sensitive personnel or other means. It warns that if you're near someone who might be sensitive, you should wear security gear like certainty handshields and follow additional instructions from the manufacturer. It also mentions that body-level vermin can cause health risks.\n\nSo, focusing on irregular spreading of a disc, I see that page 112 talks about closing doorpieces to prevent damage. The steps mentioned are:\n- Drilling the hydraulics\n- Disabling the electric system\n- Shutting off the sales tax from the tax shield\n\nThese steps seem necessary to prevent any potential damage or spread issues.

It says: \"Abfallstoffe lagern und entsorgen Das Abwasser, das während der Reinigung der Maschine anfällt, enthält Verschmutzungen mit Kunstdünger und ggf.

It says: \"Verwenden Sie nur geringen Druck bei niedriger Temperatur; 80 bar und 40 o C maximal.\" This translates to using only moderate pressure at lower temperatures, with the maximum being 80 bar and 40 degrees Celsius.\n\nAdditionally, it mentions spacing between parts: \"Halten Sie mit der Spritzdüse mindestens einen Abstand von 30 cm zu drehenden Teilen, Sensoren, Elementen des elektrischen Systems, Hydraulikschläuchen, Aufklebern und Kunststoffteile.\" So, the spritzdüse (sprinkling) must be at least 30 cm apart from rotating parts like sensors, electrical elements, hydraulics, actuators, and synthetic materials.\n\nPutting this all together, the maximum allowable pressure is specified as 80 bar.

It says, \"Fett stand measured 35 mm below the filler opening,\" which is important because that's where we need to measure.\n\nSo, putting this together, after the machine has stood still, the required grease level is 35 mm below the filler opening.

The text discusses various technical data about the machine, including its exacta type and some measurements related to it. \n\nLooking through the details, I notice columns numbered from 1 onwards. Column 5 is labeled \"Behältergewicht,\" which translates to \"container weight.\" The value under this column for Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD seems to be 3900 kg. That's a key piece of information.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the hopper weight without the hopper cover. From what I can gather, the hopper is part of the machine and its weight is listed in column 5. Since Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 has a container weight of 3900 kg, it's reasonable to assume that this includes both the hopper and the hopper cover. Therefore, without the hopper cover, the weight would be less.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other details about the hopper itself. Scanning through the text, I don't see a specific mention of the hopper's weight in relation to its type or container number. The only data provided is the container weight, which includes both hopper and cover. \n\nGiven that, it seems like the question might be expecting an answer based on the total container weight minus the hopper cover. However, without explicit information about the hopper's weight, I can't provide a precise figure. But since Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 has a container weight of 3900 kg, and assuming that the hopper is part of this setup, maybe the answer is simply 3900 kg minus some value related to the hopper cover.\n\nWait, but in the context provided, there's no mention of the hopper's weight. So perhaps the question is expecting a different approach. Maybe it's referring to the container without the hopper cover, which would be less than 3900 kg. But since I don't have that specific number, I can only go by what's provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exacta type or other specifications are relevant. Looking back at column 1, \"Behälterinhalt (l)\" is labeled as \"container volume,\" but that doesn't seem related to weight. Column 2 is \"Füllhöhe (cm),\" which is height, not weight.\n\nI think the best approach here is to state that based on the provided context, Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD 3225 has a container weight of 3900 kg, but without additional information about the hopper's weight or its specific design, I can't determine the exact hopper weight without the cover.

The number 5 indicates that it includes both the spreader and the spreader unit. The line mentions \"Kali 60\", which I believe stands for Kali 60 U/min, a measure of spread rate. Then there's \"(dB)\", which likely stands for decibel level.\n\nLooking further down, row 4 has: \"4               Schlepper + streuerender Streuer (Kali 60) (dB)\".

I think that might be a typo or formatting issue. The actual value is probably 4.6.0, which translates to 4.6 Nm. Wait, no, looking again, the values are in different columns. It's actually M6 with 4.6.0,10, but each row seems to have three numbers separated by dots. Maybe it's a misformatting.\n\nWait, let me parse that correctly. The text shows:\n\nM5: 1,7; M6:3; M8:8; M10:10; etc. So for M6, the value is 4.6.0, which I think should be 4.6 Nm? Or maybe it's a different format.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the text again:\n\nUnder \"Anzugsmomente\", there are rows like:\nM5: 1,7; M6:3; M8:8; M10:10; etc.\nSo for M6, it's 4.6.0, which I think is a typo and should be 4.6 Nm? Or maybe the numbers are in different units.\n\nWait, perhaps each row has three values separated by dots. So for M5, it's 1,7; M6:3; M8:8; etc. But that doesn't make sense because M5 is 1,7 which would be 1.7 Nm? Or maybe the numbers are in different units.\n\nWait, perhaps each row has three values separated by dots, like 4.6.0,10. That might mean 4.6.0 and 10. But that doesn't seem right because it's two separate values. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are in different units. For example, M5 is 1,7 Nm, which could be 1.7 Nm, but that seems low for a hexagon bolt. Wait, actually, looking at the context again, it's about torque required to fasten the bolt. So I think the relevant data is under \"Anzugsmomente\" (nominal tensile strength) and the friction.\n\nWait, in the text, there are two parts: one for nominal tensile strength and another for friction. The first part lists M6 as 4.6.0,10, which I think might be a typo or formatting issue. Let me check again:\n\nUnder \"Anzugsmomente\", it's:\nM5: 1,7; M6:3; M8:8; M10:10; etc.\nAnd under \"Friction\", it says:\nDer Reibungskoeffizient von 0,10 gilt für geöltes Blech, Gusseisen, gehärtete Flächen, gefettete Gewinde usw. Der höhere Wert von 0,13 gilt für trockenes Blech.\n\nSo for the friction coefficient, it's given as 0.10 or 0.13 depending on the material. The question is about a 0.2 friction, which doesn't match either of these values. Wait, but in the context, under \"Anzugsmomente\", there are entries like M6:4.6.0,10 and M8:8.8.0,10.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formatting. Maybe each row has three numbers separated by dots, such as 4.6.0, which would be 4.6 Nm? Or maybe it's a different unit. Alternatively, perhaps the values are in different units like MPa or something else.\n\nBut wait, the question is about torque required to fasten the bolt. So I think the relevant data is under \"Anzugsmomente\" (nominal tensile strength) and the friction coefficient. The text mentions that for A2 grade M6 hexagon stainless steel, with a 0.2 friction, it's an exception.\n\nWait, looking back at the context: It says, \"Anzugsmomente für Schrauben und Muttern mit gerändelter Unterseite 10 % additionally, wie",

It lists various issues related to störungstabelle (which I think refers to fertilizer dosing) and the corresponding solutions for each problem. Each entry has a page number, description, possible cause, and solution.\n\nLooking at the entries, I see that some pages have specific problems and solutions. For example, page 10 mentions an uncorrected dose in kg per hectare, which is a common issue when fertilizer flow is blocked. The solution here suggests checking the doser settings again because incorrect dosing can cause blockages.\n\nI need to find the exact page where this problem is addressed. Scanning through the context, I see that page 10 has \"Unrichtige Do- sis (kg pro Hektar) Falsche Dosis, falsche Arbeitsbreite bzw. falschen Buchstabenwert Auslauföffnung eingegeben.\" This translates to an incorrect fertilizer dose in kg per hectare, wrong input size, or wrong character in the output field.\n\nThe solution for this is on page 10: \"Führen Sie den Abdrehtest auf richtige Weide aus und geben Sie das Ergebnis ein.\" Which means they should perform a manual check test with correct fertilizer doses and report the result.\n\nSo, to answer the question, I need to provide the page number where the solution is located. The user's context clearly states that on page 10, there's a solution for an incorrect dose leading to blockage.\n</think>\n\nThe correct page to look at is page 10, which provides a solution for an uncorrected fertilizer dose causing blockage.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

The text mentions that the software is used for certain purposes like transporting körnigen Kunstdünger and the Weidelandwirtschaft. It also talks about the GEOSPREAD system with GEOCONTROL, which I think stands for Geospatial Control.\n\nLooking further down, there's a part where it says \"Die beschreibung in dieser Betriebsanleitung bezieht sich auf das GEOSPREAD Steuersystem.\" This means that the description is from the software called GEOSPREAD. The text also mentions that GEOSPREAD uses certain limits like Hydraulischem Grenzstreublech and ExactLine Grenzstreusystem, which I believe are specific to how GEOSPREAD operates.\n\nThe section about KEISTREGEN talks about how GEOSPREAD handles different types of Vorgewendungen. It specifically mentions that a schräg schließendes Vorgewende (keil) is handled by variable breitenverteilung in the GEOSPREAD system, which helps distribute the work evenly.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the extra diesel consumption when using the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD. I don't see any direct information about diesel consumption in this context. The focus seems to be on how GEOSPREAD works with different Vorgewendungen and its limits, but there's no data or numbers provided regarding fuel usage.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the extra diesel consumed by the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD, I should consider if there's any indirect information. However, looking through the context again, it doesn't mention anything about diesel consumption at all. It's all about how GEOSPREAD operates and its limits related to different Vorgewendungen.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to answer the question about the extra diesel consumed by the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD.

It mentions that for geringer Dosen, they use a feindosierung, which is a more detailed dosing method.\n\nThe question is about whether fine application (which I assume refers to the feindosierung) is more expensive than normal dosing. From the context, it seems that \"feindosierung\" is described as being used for geringer Dosen and is considered more precise or detailed. However, there's no explicit information in the text about the cost difference between fine application and normal dosing.\n\nI should check if any pricing data is provided. Scanning through the context again, I don't see any mentions of costs associated with \"feindosierung\" or \"normal dosing.\" The focus is more on how these dosing methods are used for different scenarios rather than their cost-effectiveness.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about the price difference, it's reasonable to infer that without specific data, we can't definitively say whether fine application is more expensive. However, given that \"feindosierung\" is a specialized term and might be considered more accurate or detailed, it could potentially be seen as more precise, but not necessarily more expensive.\n\nI should also consider if there's any indirect information about cost. The context doesn't mention anything about the price of these dosing methods, so I can't rely on that for an answer.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I don't have enough details to conclude whether fine application is more expensive than normal dosing.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the pages 27-29, they talk about MULTIRATE and GeoCONTROL sensors. On page 27, it mentions that MULTIRATE can be used on an ISOBUS Wiegestreuer and requires a Lizenzschlüssel for modification. It also says that MAXimal 8 Messpunkten are used, which I think refers to data points on the rate map.\n\nOn page 28, there's information about how the system handles different Streubildformen (shape of the sensor). It mentions that a streubild bei Flächendüngung is used for 100% overlap. The text also talks about spreading in various shapes like trapezförmiges and dreieckiges, which I believe are trapezoidal and triangular shapes.\n\nPage 29 discusses the ExactLine sensor, which allows spreading from the first point to the end, creating a trapezoidal shape. It says that this is suitable for small gardens because it can handle irregular shapes without issues.\n\nSo, putting this together: one-sided boundary spreading uses sensors like GeoCONTROL or ExactLine. These sensors are designed to spread in various shapes, including trapezoidal and triangular, which should work well with small garden beds where irregular layouts might be common. The system is flexible enough to adapt to different garden sizes without compromising the effectiveness of the spreading.\n\nI don't see any mention of limitations specific to small gardens that would prevent this method from being used.

It seems like the main point is about replacing ISO communication with a different setup that uses the IM Tellus Input cable.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any other specific connection types mentioned beyond what's already covered in the context. The answer should probably state that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for other purposes related to connection types, but since it's not explicitly detailed elsewhere, maybe just noting that it's primarily for ISO communication replacement isn't enough.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the context, I see a part where it says \"standardmäßig mitgeliefert Kabel 'IM Tellus input' können Sie für die anderen Anschlüsse verwenden:\" which translates to \"Standardly provided cable 'IM Tellus input' can be used for other interfaces.\" So that's another connection type. \n\nSo, the question is about what other kinds of connections can use the IM Tellus Input cable. The context mentions that it's primarily for ISO communication replacement but also allows using this cable for other purposes. Therefore, the answer should include both the usual connection types and any others mentioned.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the context, it only talks about replacing ISO communication with a different setup, not introducing new connections. So maybe the IM Tellus Input is used for ISO communication but isn't part of other connection types. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking what other kinds of connections can use the IM Tellus Input cable beyond its usual purpose. Since it's only mentioned in the context about replacing ISO with a different setup, maybe there are no other specific connection types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'IM Tellus input' is used for other purposes besides ISO communication, but I don't see that information elsewhere.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of the Hydraulic Border Spreading Plate (HBSP). Scanning through the text, I see a few sections about it. There's an image showing how to place the Auffangbehälter using a water balance horizontally. That part is about positioning them but doesn't directly address whether HBSP can be actuated pneumatically.\n\nThen there are instructions for working with the HBSP in general. It mentions placing the Auffangbehälter on the field and specifying the number of units needed. The text talks about starting the process, adjusting the flow rate, and ensuring proper spacing between operations. However, it doesn't mention anything about actuation methods like pneumatically.\n\nI also notice that there are sections about dosing and spreading using HBSP, but again, no information on how it's activated. The focus is more on the setup than the actuation mechanism.\n\nSince the question is about whether HBSP can be actuated pneumatically, I don't see any explicit mention of a pneumonic actuation method in the context provided. All the relevant information points towards HBSP being used for physical placement rather than controlled actuation.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there's no indication that the Hydraulic Border Spreading Plate can be actuated pneumatically.\n</think>\n\nThe hydraulic border spreading plate (HBSP) is not mentioned to have a pneumonic actuation method in the provided context.

Scanning through each page, I see that on Page 86 and Page 87, there are sections about Arbeiten vor dem Streuen, which translates to \"Arbeit in der Streuerweite\" or work in the ditch.\n\nOn Page 86, it mentions that for the Hydraulische Grenzstreublech (hydraulic limit), the Bleche (ditches) are long and free from damage when certain conditions are met. It also shows an image of the setup where the maximum allowable loss is 10% in the first container.\n\nThen on Page 87, it talks about evaluating and adjusting the Hydraulische Grenzstreublech. The text mentions that the maximal acceptable loss in the Graben (ditching environment) is determined by setting a limit of 10% of the container's quantity. It also provides instructions for testing the Hydraulische Grenzstreublech under flächendüngung, which involves adjusting its position and other parameters.\n\nLooking at the text, it specifically states that the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by setting a limit of 10% of the container's quantity. This seems to be the key point because it directly addresses the environmental standard used for evaluating the Hydraulische Grenzstreublech.\n\nI don't see any other mentions of different environmental standards like Emission Standards or Water Quality Standards here, so I can confidently say that the 10% limit is the relevant environmental standard.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by setting a limit of 10% of the container's quantity.",

The user provided a link to page 107 for more details about Situation A. But since I don't have access to that image or further context, I'll focus on what's given.\n\nThe question is about stopping fertilizer spreading. Looking through the text, it mentions something about \"Einscheiben-Grenzstreuen mit dem hydraulischen Grenzstreublech.\" That translates to \"Fertilizer spreader with the hydraulic limit.\" So, the process involves using a spreader that can't handle more than a certain amount.\n\nThe steps provided are: close the CABINE by closing all windows and doors; drive with the SCHLEPER (which I think is a car or truck), starting with the desired fuel cluster; turn on the BEDIEPTPULT, check the settings, not use GEOCONTROL unless necessary; set the ZAHLEN der Streuscheiben to zero if you don't want overfilling. Also, note that the overlappung can be set separately for parzellengrenze.\n\nSo, the key steps are closing CABINE, driving with SCHLEPER, turning on BEDIEPTPULT, setting ZAHLEN to zero, and possibly adjusting the overlappung if needed.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what \"seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulicborder spreading plate\" means. Let me start by breaking down the terms.\n\nFirst, \"boundary spreading.\" From what I remember in my studies, boundary spreading refers to a technique used in semiconductor manufacturing where material is spread from a boundary or edge of a wafer onto another layer. This process is crucial for creating uniform layers on wafers, which is essential for building up the entire chip.\n\nNow, the term \"hydraulicborder\" stands out. I think it's related to a specific type of boundary spreading plate used in this context. The word \"hydraulic\" makes me think of fluid dynamics or maybe something involving pressure and flow. In manufacturing, especially with wafers, hydraulic systems are often used for precise control.\n\nThe \"spreading plate\" part indicates that the process is done using a specially designed plate. I recall that in semiconductor manufacturing, there are different types of boundary spreading plates, each suited for specific applications. The term \"hydraulicborder\" probably refers to a particular kind of plate that uses hydraulic principles or methods.\n\nPutting it all together, \"seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulicborder spreading plate\" sounds like a method where material is spread from a seven-sided boundary onto another layer using a specific type of plate called a hydraulicborder spreading plate. This would be used in creating multi-layered wafers or building up chips by spreading materials across multiple boundaries.\n\nI should make sure that I'm not conflating this with other terms like \"hydraulic bonding\" which is a process used to bond two layers together, often using pressure and fluid dynamics. But in the context of boundary spreading, it's specifically about spreading material onto another layer from an edge or boundary.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n1. Boundary spreading: Material spread from a boundary or edge.\n2. Seven-sided: The shape of the boundary is seven-sided.\n3. Hydraulicborder spreading plate: A specific type of plate used in this process.\n\nI think that's it. This method is part of the techniques used to build up multi-layered wafers, ensuring each layer is properly spread and bonded together for a functional chip.\n</think>\n\nThe term \"seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulicborder spreading plate\" refers to a technique where material is spread from a seven-sided boundary onto another layer using a specific type of plate called a hydraulicborder spreading plate.

There's also a part discussing ensuring proper spacing between parts, which might relate to corrosion.\n\nIn page 21, there are two sections: one about Wartung (waiting) and another about Schüben (handling). The Schüben section mentions that the machine should be checked periodically, especially in areas with harsh conditions. It also talks about avoiding closed spaces for the Schlepper and ensuring parts are spaced correctly to prevent damage.\n\nWait, I don't see any direct information comparing corrosion rates between coastal and inland regions.

One of these steps mentions setting tire pressure. \n\nIn the instructions under Page 93, it says: \"Setzen Sie alle Teile der Maschine und des Schleppers, vornehmlich die Zapfwelle, das hydraulische, pneumatische und elektrische System in Transportstellung.\" This translates to setting all parts of the machine and the operator, specifically the flanges, hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical systems, into the transport setup. \n\nThe context doesn't mention a specific tire pressure range here, but it does talk about ensuring that these components are correctly placed during transport. However, I don't see any explicit information about the recommended tire pressure for transport mode. It seems like this step is more about mechanical placement rather than tire pressure.\n\nSince there's no direct information on tire pressure in the context provided, and based on the user's instructions to extract precise, concise answers from the given context, I should consider whether such information exists.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the pages 105-107, they discuss border spreading techniques and their effects on dosing. On page 106, there's a section about limiting Kunstdünger near the field boundary. It mentions that during the limit of application (limiting), the dosing can vary depending on whether it's one or two layers.\n\nThe text says: \"Beim Grenzabstreuen fahren Sie in der ersten Streuspur vom Feldrand aus und streuen in Richtung des Feldrands.\" This translates to, when applying at the limit of application (limiting), you should first enter the field from the outside and then exit towards the field boundary. \n\nThen it mentions: \"Beim Grenzstreuensystem keine automatischen Kalibrierungen durchgeführt werden und somit kann die Dosis nicht genau bestimmt werden.\" This means that during the limit of application, there are no automatic calibrations done, so the dosing can't be perfectly set. However, you can still enter from the outside and exit towards the boundary.\n\nThe text also states: \"Indem Sie zunächst die Parzelle streuen und erst dann die Ränder. Während des Grenzstreuens führt das Bediensystem keine automatischen Kalibrierungen durch und somit kann der zu der gewünschten Dosis dazugehörige Dosierstand nicht genau bestimmt werden.\" This clarifies that entering the field first and exiting towards the boundary is necessary during limit of application, but no automatic calibration happens, so dosing can vary.\n\nSo, the key point here is about entering from outside to approach the boundary. The question is asking for the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading. From what I gather, the text doesn't provide specific percentages related to speed reduction; it's more about the method of application rather than the speed itself. \n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there isn't a specific percentage mentioned regarding the optimal speed reduction during border spreading for compensation purposes. The focus is on the technique and its implications on dosing, not on the speed adjustments needed.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses border spreading techniques but does not provide specific information on the optimal driving speed reduction percentage required to compensate for application rate.

It also discusses how not to use high-pressure agents and ensures that the surrounding areas are secure.\n\nLooking at the specific part about storage on a slope: it mentions that if there's an outer inspection, certain conditions must be met. These include ensuring all parts in place are secure, the direct surroundings are safe, and the container is empty. It also talks about avoiding external interference during storage, maintaining a flat and stable base, and spacing between components.\n\nThe question is about whether the parking support can handle this. The context doesn't explicitly state any limitations on slope angles for the support's capacity. However, it does mention that without specific information, we should consider if there are any known limitations or standards for such storage conditions.\n\nI recall that in construction and storage, slopes up to 10 degrees might be manageable depending on the materials used. But I'm not sure about the exact specifications. Since the context doesn't provide a direct answer, I need to infer based on common practices.\n\nIn many cases, parking supports are designed for various angles, but 10 degrees is relatively gentle. It's unlikely that it would fail under normal conditions unless there were specific issues mentioned in the context.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the plastic seal material specification is for an agitator axle seal. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure where to start, but let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that an agitator is a tool used in various industries, like in mining or oil and gas, to mix fluids. The agitator has an axle, which is the part that spins around. A seal on the agitator would be something designed to prevent the mixture from spilling out, right? So, the plastic seal must be a material used for this purpose.\n\nLooking at the context provided, I see several sections discussing different aspects of securing and controlling the dosier mechanism. There's mention of ensuring the safety of the Rührerwelle (which I think is a waterway or channel), handling the axles, and procedures related to the seal. Also, there are images and detailed instructions about how to secure the seal.\n\nI remember that in industrial settings, especially for machinery like agitators, they often use specific materials for seals to ensure durability and safety. Plastic is commonly used because it's flexible and can adapt to various environments. But I'm not sure if plastic is the most durable or if another material might be preferred.\n\nWait, maybe there are specific standards or specifications for such seals. In the context provided, on page 140, there's a section about ensuring the contact with Kunstdünger and other means of protection. It mentions avoiding direct contact to prevent exposure. There's also some text about handling the axles and procedures.\n\nI think the key here is that the plastic seal is designed for agitator axle seals. The material should be flexible enough to handle the movement of the axle, which might involve high temperatures or vibrations. Also, it needs to be durable against spills or other spills from mixing fluids.\n\nLooking back at the context, I don't see any specific mention of a particular plastic material's specifications. So, maybe the answer is that the specification refers to a standard or manufacturer's product, but without more details, I can't provide exact numbers or properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the agitator axle seal uses a specific type of plastic, like polypropylene or another common polymer used in such applications. But since the context doesn't specify which material, it's safer to assume that the answer is about the general use of flexible plastic for such seals rather than a particular one.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the 'plastic seal' material specification for an agitator axle seal would involve using a flexible and durable plastic material suitable for handling the axles and preventing spillage. The exact properties like thickness, temperature resistance, or specific chemical resistance might be detailed in more specific standards or documentation.\n</think>\n\nThe plastic seal used for agitator axle seals is typically a flexible and durable material designed to handle the movement of the axle and prevent spillage. It may use materials like polypropylene or another common polymer suitable for such applications.\n\nAnswer: The plastic seal uses a flexible, durable material suited for handling the axle's movement and preventing spillage.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section labeled \"Wartung\" which seems to be an instruction for shutting down a system. Inside that, there are several steps mentioned:\n\n1. Öffnen Sie die Siebe mit dem mitgelieferten Zubehörteil und sichern Sie diese.\n2. Nehmen Sie den Rührer von der Rührerwelle ab.\n3.

Maybe the context is about something else. Let me check other parts.\n\nLooking further down, there's a part labeled \"Starten Sie den Schlepper und schalten das Bedienpult ein.\" That refers to starting the Schlepper and configuring the bed switch. Again, no mention of seal rings here either.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something in another section. Let me check the earlier parts again. There's a part about handling the elevator door: \"Starten Sie den Schlepper und schalten das Bedienpult ein.\" No seal rings there.\n\nI think I might have overlooked the 'Wartung' section. It seems to be about shutting down, but it doesn't mention anything about metal seal rings. Maybe the context is about a different part of the system that's not shown here.\n\nSince I can't find any direct information about metal seal rings in the provided context, I should consider if there's another way to infer this from other parts. Perhaps the context includes more details elsewhere, but based on what's given, it seems like metal seal rings aren't mentioned.\n\nTherefore, without explicit information, I might have to assume that the answer is unknown or not found in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe material of the 'metal seal rings' for agitator axle seal is **unknown** as no direct information is provided in the context.",

Then there's a section on IsoMatch MultiEye, which seems to be a camera setup. \n\nLooking further down, under page 147, they mention IsoMatch MultiEye as a Zubehör, which means it's a necessary component. They describe the MultiEye as having features like zwischenrahmen (which I think are the parts between the heads), Schaufelsatz for large workspaces, and a Zubehör designation.\n\nThen on page 148, they talk about an ExactLine sensor. The description says it's used for two-sided boundary separation from the last spritzgasse. It mentions that the sensor handles both sides of the boundary with precise limits and good visual results. They also mention that the sensor is a genaue Grenzstreuer (exact boundary separator) and that the ExactLine is an exact line boundary separator.\n\nSo, putting this together, the valve set in question must be IsoMatch MultiEye because it's mentioned as a Zubehör with features related to hopper empty sensor.
