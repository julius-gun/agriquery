The fine spreader can be adjusted with a lever per dosing unit.\n\nIn the fine dosing setting description, it says two of the three dosing openings are closed when using the fine dosing setting. So that means out of the three openings, two are closed during fine application.\n\nI don't see any mention of closing more than two openings or anything else related to fine application in this context.

The question is asking specifically about the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern.\n\nLooking at Page 1 of the context, there's no mention of any overlap percentages related to spreading patterns. It just lists some details about GS3 x.x. software and numbering. So, I don't see any information about how much the full field spreads before overlapping.\n\nMoving on to Page 2, which is titled \"Getting familiar with the machine,\" it does discuss spreading patterns. The text mentions a triangular spreading pattern that completely overlaps with an average working width. It also talks about one-sided boundary spreading and the use of border spreading plates. However, there's no mention of overlap percentages for these patterns.\n\nThe section on GEOSPREAD function includes information about one-sided boundary spreading with a border spreading plate, but again, it doesn't specify any overlap percentage. The mention of a trapezium-shaped pattern converting to triangular is more about the shape change rather than the spread pattern's overlap.\n\nIn the identification part, there are details about the machine's address and manufacturer, which don't relate to spreading patterns or overlap percentages.\n\nSo, after reviewing both pages, I can't find any mention of an overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern. The information provided is either about how the spreading works (like triangular vs. trapezium shapes) or about the software settings but not about the spread's overlap.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there isn't any specific information about the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern.\n</think>\n\nThe overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern is **not provided in the context**.",

It mentions \"Manuel d'utilisation\" which probably stands for \"Machine du Manutention.\" The date is June 2021, and it's from GS3 x.x. version. There's also a number of the series: 1001. The reference number is A148703640-2.\n\nLooking at Page 2, there are two sections. The first one talks about the spreader using weighcells to measure fertilizer quantity and adjusting dosing units based on application rates. It also mentions that field data from a new management system or newly created boundary is used for this purpose.\n\nThe second section provides more details about the machine's identification: Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD GS3, with specific addresses in Kverneland Group Nieuw-Vennep B.V., and it notes that certain data can be requested when needed. It also includes information about the detector exclusivity of all rights.\n\nThe third section from Page 2 discusses the system's features: ISO control system, automatic weighing, and mentions that if an ISOBUS connection isn't present, a dealer can provide a universal IsoMatch terminal for connecting other ISOBUS machines.\n\nPutting this together, the key information is about the weighcell system. The spreader uses weighcells to measure fertilizer quantity continuously. This seems to be the main point of interest in the question.\n\nI should make sure that I'm extracting the correct term and its function. The answer should mention \"weighcell\" as the system that measures fertilizer quantity.\n</think>\n\nThe weighcell system continuously measures the fertilizer quantity being spread.",

The first one is under \"Maintenance\" section, and it says that the computer determines dosing setting based on flowrate every 75 kg or every minute. It also notes that a shorter interim time can be set for shorter fields. So this seems to indicate that automatic calibration tests are conducted at specific intervals.\n\nThe second mention of Automatic Calibration test is under \"Accessoires\" section, where it says the spreader must be switched off if the hopper content drops below 100 kg because the control system switches off automatic calibration. This suggests that these tests are performed periodically to ensure accurate flowrate measurements regardless of field conditions.\n\nLooking at other parts, there's a mention of \"Automatic Calibration test\" in another section under \"Maintenance,\" but it doesn't specify the frequency. However, the context does provide clear instructions about when and how often these tests should be conducted. The first Automatic Calibration test is mentioned with intervals of 75 kg or every minute, which implies that they are done at specific points during operation.\n\nAdditionally, in another part under \"Accessoires,\" it's stated that if the hopper content drops below 100 kg, the system switches off automatic calibration. This indicates that these tests are performed to prevent inaccuracies due to field conditions like slopes and holes.\n\nSo putting this together, the spreader carries out Automatic Calibration tests every 75 kg or every minute, regardless of the field conditions mentioned.

The context mentions something about \"If the tractor does not have an ISOBUS communication...\" So, in this case, they're talking about using the Power Cable Set for non-ISO communication.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section that says: \"Si votre tracteur dispose d'une connexion ISOBUS compl\u00e8te, un c\u00e2ble avec connecteur de raccordement au tracteur (9 broches) suffit pour relier le tracteur au bo\u00eetier de commande IsoMatch Tellus.\" This translates to: If your tractor has an ISOBUS connection complete, a cable with a connection connector on the tractor (9 broches) is sufficient to link the tractor to the IsoMatch Tellus.\n\nSo, this tells me that when the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication, you can still use the Power Cable Set. The tractor's connection includes a cable with 9 broaches, which allows it to connect to the IsoMatch control box. This means the driving speed from the tractor is transmitted through this connection.\n\nI don't see any other information in the context that mentions how the GPS signal or other methods are used when ISOBUS isn't available. The focus here is on the Power Cable Set method for non-ISO communication, so I can stick to that answer.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch using the Power Cable Set when it lacks ISOBUS communication.

It also says 11 buttons for a total of 44 functions.\n\nThen there's another paragraph about learning to know the machine: \"L'accessoire IsoMatch Grip est une poign\u00e9e multifonctions regroupant de fa\u00e7on centrale les principales fonctions de la machine.

On Page 2, under \"Notez ces donn\u00e9es ici,\" it lists the address for Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD GS3, which is a type of fertilizer spreader. It doesn't mention working widths or spreaders at all.\n\nSo, based on this, I don't see any information about how the machine's working width is determined. The context provided only talks about manual instructions and machine specifications without touching on working width.\n\nTherefore, it seems that there isn't enough information in the given context to answer the question accurately.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide any information on what determines the machine's working width. Therefore, no precise answer can be extracted from the provided text.\n\n[Answer]\nThere is no information in the context about how the machine's working width is determined.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out where the position sensor for the hydraulic border spreading plate should be connected. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the pages mentioned in the context. There's a page about the hydraulic border spreading plate and another about the sensor. The question is asking specifically about the connection point of the sensor.\n\nLooking at Page 47, which seems to be the main content, it mentions that before using the spreader, you need to connect the position sensor from the electronic box on the spreader. It also says to refer to installation instructions for correct installation and mention a sensor with optional extras available in the tractor cabin. The sensor is connected via a sensor is available with these optional extras.\n\nThen, looking at Page 48, which provides additional information about the sensors, it mentions that the sensor can be used to check if the ExactLine component is in the working position. It also talks about orientation indicators and other safety precautions.\n\nThe question is asking where exactly to connect this sensor. From the context, I see that on Page 47, under \"Connect the position sensor,\" it says: \"Please also refer to the installation instructions for correct installation.\" However, there's no direct information on where to connect it in terms of physical location within the spreader.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. On Page 47, the text is about connecting the sensor from the electronic box on the spreader. It says: \"Connect the position sensor in the electronic box on the spreader.\" So that's where it should be connected\u2014inside the electronic box of the tractor.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the physical location within the spreader itself, not inside the electronic box. The context doesn't specify a particular part of the spreader where the sensor should be connected. It just mentions connecting from the electronic box on the spreader.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the sensor needs to be connected from the electronic box on the spreader. Since the question is about the connection point within the spreader, perhaps it's referring to a specific part of the spreader where the sensor is attached.\n\nLooking back at Page 47, under \"Connect the position sensor,\" it says: \"Please also refer to the installation instructions for correct installation.\" But there's no mention of a physical location. Maybe I'm supposed to infer that the sensor should be connected inside the electronic box on the spreader, but not necessarily within the spreader itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is more about where in the spreader system it should be placed relative to other components. Since the spreader has a frame and a hydraulic hose, maybe the sensor needs to be attached at a specific point along the hose or frame.\n\nWait, on Page 47, under \"Connect the position sensor,\" it says: \"Please also refer to the installation instructions for correct installation.\" But again, no physical location is given. Maybe I'm supposed to assume that the sensor should be connected inside the electronic box on the spreader, but not necessarily within the spreader itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is more about where in the spreader system it's placed relative to other components.

Let me try to summarize:\n\n- The question is asking where the position sensor should be connected.\n- In Page 47, it says \"Connect the position sensor in the electronic box on the spreader.\"\n- So within the electronic box of the tractor, but not necessarily within the spreader itself.\n\nBut perhaps the answer expects a specific location within the spreader. Since the context doesn't provide that detail, maybe I'm supposed to infer based on standard practices.\n\nWait, another thought: On Page 48, under \"Operations before epandage,\" it mentions connecting the exact line in the electronic box and using an electric plug. It also says to check for dirt on hoses or plugs. So perhaps the sensor is connected inside the electronic box, but not within the spreader.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sensor should be connected at a specific point along the hose or frame of the spreader.\n\nWait, I'm not sure. The context doesn't specify where exactly in the spreader",

Let me go through the context provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the context, there are several paragraphs related to the coupling shaft. The first paragraph talks about checking the coupling shaft length. It mentions that if the coupling shaft is too long for most tractors, it must be cut down before connecting it. So, cutting the coupling shaft is a precaution needed when it's too long.\n\nThen, in another part of the context, there's a section discussing lifting and lowering the power lift. It talks about adequate space for the coupling shaft to slide in and out and sufficient overlap between profiled tubes during extreme operating angles. But that doesn't directly relate to checking the length before working between the tractor and machine.\n\nThere's also a paragraph about putting the machine on a supporting beam before moving between the tractor and machine. This ensures the machine can't drop if the power lift is operating while you're in between, which might cause injury. However, this is more about safety during operation rather than specifically checking the coupling shaft length.\n\nAnother part mentions that the coupling shaft must be cut to the correct length before connecting it to the tractor. So, cutting the coupling shaft is a specific precaution needed when it's too long.\n\nLooking back at the question, it asks what specific precaution should be taken before working between the tractor and machine to check the coupling shaft length. The key information here is that if the coupling shaft is too long, it must be cut down. This is done before connecting it to the tractor, which is part of working between them.\n\nSo, the answer should focus on cutting the coupling shaft when it's too long. It's a specific precaution needed for safety and proper operation.\n</think>\n\nThe specific precaution required before working between the tractor and machine to check the coupling shaft length is to cut the coupling shaft when it is too long for most tractors.

The text is about connecting a tractor's tractor unit, specifically focusing on decoupling ropes and power lifts. \n\nLooking at the instructions, I need to focus only on the specific information related to the question. The question asks what must be ensured with decoupling ropes during power lift connection.\n\nI remember that decoupling ropes are used to disconnect electrical connections in machinery. During a power lift operation, which is when a machine is powered up and then shut down quickly, there's a risk of decoupling ropes from disconnecting accidentally or causing damage.\n\nThe context mentions that the decoupling ropes must never be tense and must provide sufficient freedom for movement even with the power lift in the lowest position. This means they shouldn't be too tight to prevent disconnection when the machine is operating at its lowest speed or position, which could otherwise cause a quick disconnect of the connection.\n\nAdditionally, during driving, factors like turning circle (the width/length of the turn) and mass (sluggishness) can affect braking performance. Ensuring these are sufficient helps in maintaining safe manageability and preventing accidents.\n\nSo putting it all together, the key points are:\n1. Decoupling ropes must not be tense.\n2. They need to provide enough freedom for movement even when the power lift is at its lowest position.\n3.

It mentions GS3 x.x., machine number 1001, and a series number. The image references are unclear, but it seems like this is part of a technical document related to fertilizer application.\n\nMoving to Page 2, the context includes a detailed calculation section. There's a formula written out: Flowrate required = (kg/min). Then there are some numbers multiplied together: 600 m x 8 km/h x 25 kg/ha. The result is 9 kg/min. \n\nAfter that, it says \"Set the discharge point as indicated in the chart: J.\" Then another calculation with 3 x 9 = 27 kg/min. It also mentions this value corresponds to a dosing setting of 18+3 (=21). There's a mention of a manual calibration test.\n\nThe images show a spreading chart and some software instructions, but I'm focusing on the formula here. The key part is where it says Flowrate required = (kg/min) multiplied by working width in meters, driving speed in km/h, and application rate in kg/ha.

But I'm not entirely sure about the units here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is flowrate (kg/min) = (kg/ha) * (m * km/h). So 25 kg/ha * 8 km/h * 10 m would give 2000 kg/(ha*km*h), but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is flowrate (kg/min) = (kg/ha) * width (m) * speed (km/h). So 25 kg/ha * 8 km/h * 10 m would be 2000 kg/(ha*km*h), but that still doesn't make sense because the units don't cancel out correctly. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's flowrate (kg/min) = (kg/ha) * width (m) * speed (km/h). So 25 kg/ha * 10 m * 8 km/h.

So if someone is near the machine while it's running, they could get hurt.\n\nAnother point mentions keeping a safe distance until the moving parts come to rest.

It says that if you can't find the cause of failure or stoppage, carefully remove vanes to get a better look into the discharge opening and dosing openings. Also, passing an object like a screwdriver through the discharge opening might help spot any damage.\n\nSo putting this together, when the spreader fails or stops, I should first check the spreading discs and discharge opening on Page 1. Then, if that doesn't show anything, remove the vanes from Page 2 to inspect better. These two actions seem necessary for diagnosing and fixing the issue.\n</think>\n\nThe two actions needed are checking the spreading discs and discharge opening (Page 1) and removing vanes (Page 2).\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

On Page 2, it seems like there are several sections labeled A, B, and C. \n\nLooking at Page 2, under section B, there are a few points listed:\n- Lower the border spreading plate.\n- Close the tap to prevent lifting while working.\n- Close dosing on the side with no spreading.\n- Disconnect drive of the plate on that side.\n- Set using online chart.\n\nThen, there's an indication about adjusting settings. It says if the spreader is not spreading wide enough, adjust the discharge opening 2 letters towards A (which I assume is position A). If it spreads too much, adjust towards U (position U).\n\nSo, when the disc spreads irregularly, the user should follow these steps:\n1. Close the tap to prevent lifting.\n2.

The section about epandage talks about additional checks after work, ensuring longevity, etc., which might be more about maintenance than specific temperatures.\n\nThe procedure for cleaning includes steps like using a high-pressure cleaner without aiming at seals or breathers to prevent dirt and moisture. It also mentions not setting up electrical components and avoiding water causing electrical failures.\n\nThere's another section on how to handle the machine when there are problems, mentioning disconnecting power from both the machine and the tracteur (which I think is the tractor). It says to repair problems immediately or contact an expert without opening the machinery in a closed space. This part doesn't mention temperature limits but focuses on safety.\n\nThe final section about working with the machine charges mentions that the maximum weight of the machine should be distributed between the essieux, and certain percentages (20% on one side and 45% on the other) must rest on them to maintain good maneuverability.

After that, you need to measure the level of the graisse (grain size) and ensure it's at 35 mm below the orifice. So, the key point here is that after standing still for a short time, the granulom\u00e8tre must have a certain level.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about the grease level below the filler opening.

The page mentions \"Manuel d'utilisation,\" which I think is French for manual use instructions. It includes details about the version of the log file, numbering, and references.\n\nOn Page 2, there's more detailed information about the machine itself. It lists the type of machine as Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD GS3, which sounds like a specific model from Kverneland Group. The page also provides address details for the manufacturer and concessionor, giving me some context on where this machine is used.\n\nThe question is about \"seven-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate.\" From what I can gather, the term \"hydraulic border spreading plate\" refers to a tool or device that's used in spreading materials across a field. The \"one-sided\" and \"seven-sided\" parts indicate different configurations of how this spreading is done.\n\nIn the context, Page 2 talks about one-sided boundary spreading, which I think means spreading material on one side of a boundary.

On Page 1, there's some text about manual usage instructions for GS3, which I'm not entirely familiar with, but maybe it's related to machinery or equipment. The key part here is that when vanes wear out quickly, especially the long ones positioned in groups of three, the first vane will wear fastest.\n\nOn Page 2, there are specific tips about the vanes. It mentions that even wear of the vanes is important because they're positioned in groups of three. The first vane wears out the quickest. There's a tip saying to exchange the first vane after the fixed one and then over time with the central vane to make them wear evenly. This helps maintain an optimal spreading pattern.\n\nThe question is asking why damage to these parts (vanes, disc, or bushing) is most likely due to a hard object. The context doesn't explicitly state this, but from what I understand about machinery, when there's a hard object causing wear, it can affect the entire system. \n\nI remember reading somewhere that any physical obstruction, like a piece of debris, could cause wear and tear on parts.

It talks about avoiding direct contact during filling or spreading, but nothing about being in fertilizer itself.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is that they shouldn't be in fertilizer because it's not safe to fall there without a physician. But I'm not sure if that's covered in the context provided. The context only mentions avoiding direct contact with materials when working on machinery, not directly falling into fertilizer.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the best answer is that they should stay out of fertilizer and avoid any situation where they could be in it. But since the question is about a fall without a physician, maybe the answer is to stay away from fertilizer altogether.\n</think>\n\nCarefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible.\n\nAnswer: They should stay out of fertilizer entirely.",

After cleaning, they mention using grease and oil again for conservation. There's a tip about not using high-pressure cleaners on the seals or breathers to prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.\n\nThen, there are some additional paragraphs about electrical components and safety. It says not to set up electrical components because water can cause failures.

Then there's another section titled \"Page 2\", but it looks like it's just repeating information from Page 1.

It spreads granular products like fertilizers and seeds. The manual is available on GS3 Logic Works' website.\n\nThe question is asking about the curriculum needed for agrarians to be competent in operating this machine. From the context, I can see that the training program includes several key points:\n\n1. **Safety Guidelines**: Important because agricultural machinery can be dangerous.\n2. **Instructions and Maintenance Requirements**: Users need clear instructions on how to use the machine and know what to do if something goes wrong.\n3. **Reparation and Deterrents**: The manufacturer has specific rules about when repairs are needed, which is crucial for compliance.\n4. **Basic Safety Requirements**: Understanding basic safety principles is essential for operating machinery safely.\n5. **Traffic Regulations**: Knowing how traffic flows around the machine helps prevent accidents.\n6. **System Functions and Identification**: Users must know how the machine works internally and identify it properly.\n\nI don't see any other specific details about training content beyond what's already mentioned in the context.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about ISOMatch Tellus and ISOBUS systems. It mentions that pictograms are used in safety instructions for agricultural machines. Specifically, it talks about ensuring safety during work with machinery, mentioning things like hydraulic pressure limits and vehicle types required.\n\nThe question is asking specifically about the international standard where these pictograms are used. The context doesn't mention any specific standards beyond ISO or ISOBUS. It does say \"SI you use the IsoMatch Tellus system on a tractor with ISOBUS communication systems, you can rattle the tractor standard CAN module of the tractor at the connection point of the CAN 7 cable provided.\"\n\nWait, but that's more about how to connect the cables rather than where the pictograms are used. The safety instructions mention \"Do not exceed the maximum hydraulic pressure of 210 bars\" and \"working with higher pressure may damage your machine and result in dangerous situations.\" These are specific safety measures.\n\nLooking back at the context, I see that under the ISOMatch Tellus section, it mentions ensuring safety by using the CAN module. But again, that's about the connection method, not where pictograms are used.\n\nThe part about \"9 Ad adaptation des tracteurs non ISOBUS au moyen du faisceau de raccordement IsoMatch Power\" talks about installing a power system for compatibility with ISOBUS. It mentions using the IsoMatch Tellus system and that the speed is indicated on the IsoMatch Tellus via ISOBUS technology.\n\nWait, but again, it's not specifying an international standard here. The question is about where pictograms are used in safety instructions. Since the context doesn't mention any specific standards beyond ISO or ISOBUS, maybe the answer is that pictograms are used under ISO standards for safety purposes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pictograms are part of the ISO Match Tellus system's documentation, which specifies how to use them in safety instructions. But without more context on what exactly the pictograms represent, it's hard to pinpoint an exact standard.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at other parts of the context. The first paragraph mentions \"For your safety\" and then lists several safety instructions. It says: \"6 Safety; For your safety; Other guidelines.\" So these are general safety instructions, not specific standards.\n\nThe next section talks about ISOMatch Tellus and ISOBUS systems, mentioning that pictograms are used in safety instructions. But again, it's more about the system than the standard.\n\nI think the key here is to recognize that the pictograms are part of the ISO Match Tellus system, which uses specific international standards for safety. However, since the context doesn't specify an exact standard beyond ISO or ISOBUS, I might need to infer that they're using ISO standards for safety purposes in these instructions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pictograms are part of the ISO Match Tellus documentation, which is designed under ISO standards. But without explicit information on what specific standard the pictograms represent, it's challenging.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the last paragraph: \"9 Ad adaptation des tracteurs non ISOBUS au moyen du faisceau de raccordement IsoMatch Power.\" It mentions that the speed is indicated via ISOBUS technology. So perhaps the pictograms are part of the ISO Match Tellus system's documentation for safety, which uses specific international standards.\n\nBut again, without more context on what exactly the pictograms represent, it's hard to say.

The key points seem to be about how each version of the ISOBUS connection works with the IsoMatch Tellus GO system.\n\nLooking at the first part: \"The latest developments in ISOBUS communication between tractor and implement and ease-of-use are all incorporated into the IsoMatch Tellus GO.\" This suggests that the IsoMatch system uses different ISOBUS versions, each with their own specifications.\n\nNext, there's a section about connecting the ISOBUS tractor via IM Tellus 9-point in Cab cable. It mentions that if your tractor has a full connection, you can use the 9-pins cable between the tractor and IsoMatch GO control box. If not, they provide an IsoMatch Tellus GO terminal. This implies that there are different versions of the ISOBUS protocol used for communication.\n\nThen, it talks about the \"Quick menu navigation with the scroll wheel and additional keys.\" The image shows a scroll wheel on the upper right, which is likely part of the interface for command execution.\n\nThere's also a section about ISOMatch Tellus GO allowing command execution via the 9-pins cable or the Input IM Tellus cable.

It mentions that if the box is engaged and you're in danger, unintended functions might activate while you're switching off. But that doesn't seem directly related to battery flattening when left on with the engine off.\n\nThen, I see some information about ISO control applications like Compact and Complete, which offer complete ISO control but mention smaller dimensions, USB connections, and no WLAN/WIFI.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mentions of 'profiled tubes' or 'coupling shaft'. Scanning through the text, I see several steps related to attaching and mounting the coupling shaft. One of them says: \"Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.\" That's a key point because it involves profiled tubes.\n\nLooking further down, there are instructions about grease for these tubes. It mentions that grease should be applied before attaching the coupling shaft. The text also specifies to measure the level of grease and add it until desired. However, I don't see any mention of particular types of grease here.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. There's a section about removing dirt or fertiliser from the gearbox, opening by removing a filler cap, measuring the level, adding until desired, closing the filler, and then grease both profiled tubes. It says to grease the inner profiled tube but doesn't specify the type.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for any tables or instructions that mention granulom\u00e9trie (grain size distribution) because that's crucial for selecting the right type of grease. The context does mention \"D\u00e9termination de la granulom\u00e9trie\" in a paragraph, which refers to determining the grain size distribution.

Looking back, yes, under \" D\u00e9terminations du tableau d'\u00e9pandage\", it mentions selecting from a table based on granulom\u00e9trie. But again, no details on the type of grease.\n\nI think the key here is that profiled tubes require specific grease to prevent issues during operation. Since there's no explicit mention of the type in the context provided, I might have missed something. Maybe it's implied by the process? Or perhaps the answer expects a general recommendation without specifics?\n\nWait, looking at the instructions again: \"Slide the coupling shaft halves into each other.\" It doesn't specify the grease type. So maybe the answer is that any type of grease can be used as long as it meets the granulom\u00e9trie requirements. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the context implies that profiled tubes require a specific type based on their size distribution. Since the user asked for the type recommended, maybe they expect an answer like \"crystallin\" or \"granules\", but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI think I need to stick strictly to the given instructions and avoid making assumptions beyond what's provided. The question is about the specific grease type for profiled tubes on the coupling shaft. Since there's no direct mention of a particular type in the context, maybe the answer is that any type can be used as long as it meets the granulom\u00e9trie criteria.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the instructions, I see that the user provided an example where they had to extract specific information. In this case, the question is about the grease type for profiled tubes.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are several sections labeled with numbers like 35, 36, etc., which probably refer to different products or types. The product name mentioned is 'SlugPellets', and under that, there's a list of other products like Transport, preparation of the machine, security, Triangle d'avertissement, Type d'engrais, cristallin, granul\u00e9s, Granul\u00e9s anti-limaces, Semences, Type de graisse. These seem to be different types or components related to slug pellets.\n\nLooking further down, there's an image section with 'SlugPellets', 'Schnecken Linsen', and 'Delicia'. The numbers 164 and others are probably product IDs or something else, but the main focus is on the product names. \n\nThe question is asking about the specific type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' used in a spreading chart example. In the context, I see that there's an image section with 'SlugPellets', 'Schnecken Linsen', and 'Delicia'. The numbers 164 might be product IDs, but since the question is about the type of slug pellets, I should focus on the product names.\n\nI notice that under 'SlugPellets', there are multiple entries like Transport, preparation of the machine, etc., which don't seem relevant. Then, looking at the images section, it mentions 'Schnecken Linsen' and 'Delicia'. The numbers 12 m and kg/min in the table might be flow rate and application rate, but again, not directly related to the product type.\n\nWait, I see that there's a specific image labeled as \"SlugPellets\" with \"Schnecken Linsen\" and \"Delicia\". So, perhaps these are different products within slug pellets. The question is about which type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' was used. \n\nLooking back at the context, I see that there's a product named 'Schnecken Linsen', which likely refers to snails or snail-like structures, and 'Delicia' might be a specific brand or model within that category. The numbers in the table like 12 m and kg/min could indicate flow rate and application rate, but again, not directly related to product type.\n\nI think the key here is that under 'SlugPellets', there are images of 'Schnecken Linsen' and 'Delicia'. Since the question is about the specific type used in the example, I should look for any mentions of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' in the context. \n\nIn the provided context, it seems that 'SlugPellets' have multiple product types listed, but none specifically mention 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen'. However, looking at the image section, there's an image labeled as \"SlugPellets\" with \"Schnecken Linsen\" and \"Delicia\". So, perhaps these are different products within slug pellets.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking what type of 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen' was used. Since the context doesn't explicitly mention a specific product name for Delicia Schnecken Linsen, but in the image section, there's an image labeled as \"SlugPellets\" with both \"Schnecken Linsen\" and \"Delicia\". So, perhaps the answer is that it's a type of 'Schnecken Linsen' or 'Delicia', but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the context, under 'SlugPellets', there are specific product types. Let me check again: The context lists various products like Transport, preparation of the machine, Triangle d'avertissement, Type d'engrais, cristallin, granul\u00e9s, etc., but none specifically mention 'Delicia Schnecken Linsen'.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed something. In the context, there's an image section with \"SlugPellets\", \"Schnecken Linsen\", and \"Delicia\". So, maybe these are different product types within slug pellets. Since the question is about Delicia Schnecken Linsen, but in the context, it's not directly mentioned.\n\nI think I might have missed a part of the context where the specific type is listed. Let me check again: The context has lines like \"35 Tracteur ISOBUS 32\", then under Transport, there are other products. Then, at the end, there's an image section with \"SlugPellets\" and others. So, perhaps in that image section, it's mentioned that 'Schnecken Linsen' is a type",

In section 10, it mentions that the external system doesn't communicate with the control box using the RS 232 plug because the connections don't match. It also says that if they do connect, they need to check the pin occupation in the control box's user manual and adjust settings accordingly.\n\nIn section 11, there's a note saying that the external system isn't communicating with the control box at all.

It mentions that before using the tubes, they should chevaucher (chckousser) them as much as possible and at least 150 mm. They also note that when the force from the tractor and the machine are in the same height, they need to adjust the two tubes until each has a minimum of 25 mm on both ends. There's a step where they raccourcisse (shorten) the tubes until they reach 25 mm.\n\nThen there's another part about fertilizer granules. It says that if the diameter of 80-100% of the fertiliser granules is between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, it's good to spread regardless of the size of the remaining granules. If 20% or more are greater than 4.75 mm, it could damage crops if they make holes in the leaves.\n\nLooking at the question: \"What is the maximum acceptable 'chunk' size of fertilizer in mm to prevent blockage?\" The relevant part here is about ensuring that the fertilizer granules don't cause blockage. From the context, when the diameter is between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, it's good to spread regardless of remaining sizes.\n\nSo the maximum acceptable chunk size would be 4.75 mm because anything above that could cause blockage if not adjusted properly.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum acceptable chunk size of fertilizer in millimeters to prevent blockage is **4.75 mm**.",

The user has given me a section from a document that seems to be about fertilizer application instructions. It includes details like machine specifications, materials needed, and some data tables related to spreaders.\n\nLooking at the text, there are mentions of \"wind speed\" but not in a specific table or chart. However, I see a note where it says: \"Notez ces donn\u00e9es ici afin de les avoir \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main lorsqu'elles vous seront demand\u00e9es.\" This translates to noting these data points so they can be used when needed.\n\nIn the data tables provided, there are sections that mention wind speed limits. For example, under \"Notes\" and \"To be done before spreading,\" there's a section titled \"Notez ces donn\u00e9es ici.\" The text within this section lists various wind speeds in km/h, such as 5-7 km/h, 6-8 km/h, etc., up to 10 m/sec. Wait, hold on, the units here are mixed: some are km/h and others are m/sec. I need to check for consistency.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- 5,0 km/h\n- 6,0 km/h\n- 7,0 km/h\n- 8,0 km/h\n- 9,0 kg/ha\n- 10,0 kg/ha\n- 11,0 kg/ha\n\nAnd the wind speed mentioned is 10 m/sec. Wait, that's a typo because 10 m/sec is equal to about 36 km/h (since 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h). So there might be an inconsistency here.\n\nBut in the context of the data tables, it seems that wind speed limits are given as km/h. The user's question mentions \"wind speed\" but doesn't specify units. However, looking at the data, all the wind speeds listed are in km/h except for 10 m/sec, which is a mistake.\n\nWait, actually, no\u2014the data table shows:\n\n- 5,0 km/h\n- 6,0 km/h\n- 7,0 km/h\n- 8,0 km/h\n- 9,0 kg/ha.10,0     11,0\n\nAnd the wind speed mentioned is 10 m/sec. But in the data table, it's written as \"10 m/sec.\" That seems incorrect because 10 m/sec is about 36 km/h.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again:\n\nIn the note section, under \"To be done before spreading,\" there's a line: \"Notez ces donn\u00e9es ici afin de les avoir \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main lorsqu'elles vous seront demand\u00e9es.\" Then below that, it lists wind speed limits as 5-7 km/h, 6-8 km/h, etc., up to 10 m/sec. Wait, no, the data table shows:\n\nThe data is presented in a table with columns like kg/min, kg/min, 5,0, 6,0, etc., and rows for different values of kg/ha.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user's question is about wind speed limits before spreading quality becomes unacceptable. In the data tables, there are mentions of \"Notez ces donn\u00e9es ici afin de les avoir \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main lorsqu'elles vous seront demand\u00e9es.\" which means note these data points so they can be used when needed.\n\nLooking at the data table, under \"Notes\" and \"To be done before spreading,\" it lists wind speed limits as 5-7 km/h, 6-8 km/h, etc., up to 10 m/sec. Wait, but that's a mix of units. The user is asking about wind speed in m/sec.\n\nWait, perhaps the data table has both km/h and m/sec? Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the data table, under \"Notes\" and \"To be done before spreading,\" it lists:\n\n- 5,0 km/h\n- 6,0 km/h\n- 7,0 km/h\n- 8,0 km/h\n- 9,0 kg/ha.10,0     11,0\n\nWait, that doesn't include m/sec. So perhaps the data table is in km/h only.\n\nBut then why does it mention 10 m/sec? Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to m/sec but made an error in the text.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the wind speed limit mentioned in the context is 10 m/sec, which is about 36 km/h, and that's what needs to be avoided before spreading quality becomes",

It mentions that before spreading, you should place 1 trough next to the fictive border ditch and two more in the ditch. Then, you start the tractor with the PTO shaft at 400 rpm instead of the standard 540 rpm. The tractor must be driven 2 meters away from the field edge.\n\nI remember that during border spreading, the control system doesn't automatically calibrate, so the application rate can deviate. To compensate for this, they suggest reducing the PTO shaft speed by 25%. So, instead of 540 rpm, it's set to 400 rpm, which is a 25% reduction.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other details. The question specifically asks about the driving speed reduction percentage. From what I see in the context, that's exactly what they mention: reducing from 540 to 400 rpm, which is a 25% decrease.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should be a 25% reduction in PTO shaft RPM during border spreading.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading is a 25% decrease from the standard 540 rpm to 400 rpm.",

However, since the question is about choosing the optimal type, I should consider which one is more standard or commonly used.\n\nFrom what I remember, Phillips screws are typically used for precise measurements and adjustments because they have a specific thread pattern that allows for accurate spacing. Flathead screws might be simpler but could lead to less precision if not properly aligned. \n\nGiven that the context mentions turning nuts on fastening bolts several times to loosen them, it suggests that the user is using a screwdriver with appropriate nuts. Since both types are used interchangeably in such contexts, I need to determine which one is more likely to be optimal for this specific adjustment.\n\nI think Phillips screws might be more precise and commonly used for such tasks because they're designed for accurate measurements.

It says that if the tractor doesn't have the ISO 11786 in cab connection, they can exchange the whole cable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the extension cable is called \"C\u00e2ble de rallonge ISO\" and has a length of 144 meters. The context specifies that this cable is used for connecting to the radar or wheel sensor and the speed sensor/radar. It also mentions that if the tractor doesn't have the ISO 11786 connection, they can exchange it.\n\nI don't see any other cables mentioned with different lengths or specific instructions about their optimal length. The main point is the \"C\u00e2ble de rallonge ISO\" which is clearly stated as having a length of 144 meters.\n</think>\n\nThe extension cable optimal for ISO 11786 in cab tractor connection is \"C\u00e2ble de rallonge ISO\" with a length of 144 meters.\n\nAnswer: C\u00e2ble de rallonge ISO, 144 m.",

On Page 1, there's a mention of IsoMatch Grip being available separately from the ISO tractor or ISOMatch control box. It also includes some data about the machine number and series. Then on Page 2, I see a section titled \"GEOCONTROL screen\" which displays activities in a bar below the screen.\n\nThe question is specifically about the free test period for the 'GEOCONTROL software' user licence. Scanning through the context, I don't immediately find any mention of a test period duration. The information provided seems to be more about machine details and some technical notes on spreading pattern tests.\n\nSince there's no explicit section or data that mentions the duration of the free test period for the 'GEOCONTROL software', it seems like this information isn't present in the context given.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context on page 148, there's a section about Accessories where it mentions \"Hopper empty sensor\" and \"ExactLine\". It says the hopper empty sensor is equipped with an alarm that goes off when almost empty. Then under \"Border spreading\", it refers to ExactLine as a tool for boundary track spreading from the last tramline.\n\nNow, looking at page 149, which seems to be about granulometry, there are images and some instructions. The text mentions \"Empty DataFrame\" columns and index, but that's probably irrelevant here. There are also several CONSEIL (advice) sections advising on regular cleaning of the tapestry, which again doesn't seem directly related.\n\nThe question is asking specifically about a 'valve set' that comes with a hopper empty sensor. Scanning through the context, I don't see any mention of a valve set or ExactLine in relation to the hopper empty sensor. The only valve mentioned is \"ExactLine\", but it's more about boundary spreading than a valve set.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. On page 148, under Accessories, there's an image labeled \"Hopper empty sensor\" and another image with the text: \"The hopper empty sensor is equipped with an alarm that goes off when the hopper is almost empty.\" It also says ExactLine is a tool for boundary track spreading from the last tramline.\n\nBut none of this mentions a valve set. The question specifically asks about a valve set that comes with a hopper empty sensor. Since there's no information in the context provided about such a valve set, I can't find any details here. Therefore, it seems like there isn't enough information to answer the question as per the given context.\n\nI should probably respond by stating that, based on the provided context, there is no information available regarding a valve set used with a hopper empty sensor. However, if I had more context or different pages discussing similar equipment, maybe I could find more details. But right now, it's not present.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide any information about a valve set that comes with a hopper empty sensor.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the context given. There are two pages mentioned: Page 1 and Page 149. On Page 1, there's an article titled \"Manuel d'utilisation\" with some dates and technical specifications. The key part here is that it mentions a drain kit available for emptying the hopper quickly.\n\nOn Page 150, which seems to be page 149 in the context, there are several sections. I notice that under the section titled \"Identification de la machine,\" there's a list of data points related to filling levels, widths, and weights of the hopper. Specifically, for each filling level (l), there are corresponding values like 122, 141, 160, and 179 cm. However, I don't see any mention of the drain rate or liters per minute here.\n\nLooking back at Page 1, it doesn't provide information about the drain kit's capacity or fill level in terms of liters per minute. The technical specifications are more about the hopper's dimensions and weight, not the drain rate. \n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, there isn't any explicit information about the drain rate in liters per minute for the 'drain kit.' Without additional data from either page, I can't determine the exact drain rate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be that the specific information is not present in the given context.\n</think>\n\nThe drain kit's capacity isn't specified in the provided context.",

It also mentions that these covers protect the fertilizer against humidity and dirt. \n\nOn Page 2, under the section about hopper cover, it says: \"The hopper cover must be mounted on top of the hopper extension to protect the content against weather or spray.\" Additionally, there's a note about UV resistance in the context of machine identification.\n\nWait, I'm not sure if \"sail\" is mentioned here. The text doesn't explicitly state what material the sail uses for the hopper cover. It does mention that the covers are made from materials like GS3 and electric hopper covers, but it doesn't specify the exact material used for the sail or its UV resistance.\n\nI think the question might be a bit unclear because \"sail\" isn't clearly defined in the context provided.
