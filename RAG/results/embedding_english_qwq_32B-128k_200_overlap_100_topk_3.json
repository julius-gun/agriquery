There's a section that says: \"2 of the 3 dosing openings are closed when using the fine dosing setting.\" That seems directly relevant. Another part mentions \"Close 2 of the 3 dosing openings to prevent blockages.\" So both statements indicate that two openings are closed. \n\nI should check if there's any other part that might contradict this. The context also mentions that when in fine application, the remaining opening is the one used, implying two are closed. The handle indications mention \"1 open hole and 2 thick holes for fine application\", which also suggests two are closed (since only one is open). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2. The question is straightforward, and the context clearly states the number.

The user wants to know how a tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to the IsoMatch when the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS communication.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the context carefully. The key sections here are about tractors without ISOBUS and how IsoMatch helps. The question specifically mentions the driving speed transmission.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a part that says: \"If speed is not measured on the (trailed) machine, but via the tractor, the speed sensor or the adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics.\" That seems relevant because it talks about using the tractor's own speed sensor connected to IsoMatch.\n\nAdditionally, under \"Adapting non-ISO tractors with IsoMatch power cable set,\" it mentions that after using the power cable set, the driving speed is transmitted via ISOBUS. Wait, but the question is about when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. Hmm, maybe there's a difference here. The power cable set might enable ISOBUS, so after using it, the transmission happens via ISOBUS. But the user's scenario is when the tractor doesn't have ISOBUS. So perhaps the answer is using the speed sensor and adapter cable connected to IsoMatch, as mentioned earlier.\n\nThe question is about the method when there's no ISOBUS. The first part says that if the tractor's speed is used, connect the speed sensor or adapter cable to IsoMatch. The power cable set is for adding ISOBUS, so once that's done, the speed is transmitted via ISOBUS. But the user is asking for the case where the tractor lacks ISOBUS, so before adding the power cable set? Wait, no—the question is how to transmit speed when the tractor lacks ISOBUS. The answer would be using the adapter cable or speed sensor connected to IsoMatch. The power cable set is part of the solution to make the tractor ISOBUS-ready, so maybe the steps are: use the adapter cable to connect the tractor's speed sensor to IsoMatch. \n\nThe exact answer should be that the speed sensor or adapter cable is connected to the IsoMatch to capture the tractor's speed signal. The context also mentions that the GPS can be used via RS232, but the question is about speed. So the precise answer is connecting the speed sensor or adapter cable to the IsoMatch.\n</think>\n\nThe speed sensor or adapter cable is to be connected to the IsoMatch to capture the speed signal from the tractor electronics.",

The key details here are \"upper left\" and \"red extension\". The sentence directly mentions the location of the main switch. The user wants the exact wording from the context, so I shouldn't paraphrase. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of the main switch location. Scanning again, the next parts talk about pressing the button for at least 1 second and safety instructions, but nothing about the location.

The context mentions several steps related to mounting and checking the coupling shaft. The key part here is about precautions when working between the tractor and machine.\n\nLooking at the context, there are multiple mentions of putting the machine on a supporting beam. For example, it says: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine\" and repeats this again later. The reason given is to prevent the machine from dropping if the power lift is accidentally operated, which could cause injury.\n\nAnother point mentioned is switching off the tractor engine and removing the keys. The exact line is: \"Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\" So combining these, the precautions are using a supporting beam, turning off the engine, and removing the keys.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the precaution before working between them. The answer should be the exact steps listed. The primary one mentioned first is the supporting beam. The other steps (engine off and keys removed) are also part of the precaution but the question might be looking for the main one. However, the context states both actions as part of the precaution. \n\nWait, the question is about the specific precaution. The context says: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. This will ensure that the machine cannot drop... Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\"\n\nSo the answer should include both putting on a supporting beam and switching off the engine with keys removed. But the user wants the exact information. Let me check the exact wording again. The question is about the precaution before working between them. The context says \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine\" and also mentions switching off the engine. Since both are steps mentioned in the same paragraph, they are both part of the precautions. \n\nHowever, the user might need the exact phrases. The answer should list both actions as per the context. But the answer needs to be concise. The primary instruction is to put the machine on a supporting beam. The other steps (engine off and keys) are additional precautions. The question asks for the specific precaution, so maybe the main one is the supporting beam. But the context combines both as part of the precaution. Let me check again.\n\nThe exact lines: \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\"\n\nSo the answer should include both actions. But the user wants the answer to be precise and exact. The question is about the precaution before working between them. The answer is \"Put the machine on a supporting beam\" and \"switch the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\" But since the user wants the answer in a concise way, maybe combining them. However, the context presents them as two separate steps. The first is explicitly mentioned before moving in between, so the primary answer is the supporting beam. The other steps are additional but part of the same precaution. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about the precaution before working between the tractor and machine. The context says \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine\" and then adds \"Switch also the tractor engine off...\" So both are part of the precautions. The answer should include both. But the user wants the exact information. Let me check the exact wording again. The answer should be the exact phrases from the context. The first part is \"Put the machine on a supporting beam\" and the second is \"Switch the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\" So combining them as per the context's instruction. The user's answer should list both. But maybe the main one is the supporting beam. Let me see the exact question again: \"What specific precaution should be taken before working between the tractor and machine to check the coupling shaft length?\" The context says \"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between...\" which directly answers the question. The other steps are additional precautions but the primary answer is the supporting beam. However, the context also mentions the engine and keys. Since the user wants the exact answer, perhaps both are needed. The answer should be both points. Let me check the context again. The exact lines are:\n\n\"Put the machine on a supporting beam before moving in between the tractor and machine. This will ensure that the machine cannot drop if the power lift should inadvertently be operated while you are between the tractor and machine. Switch also the tractor engine off and remove the keys from the ignition.\"\n\nSo the two precautions are: 1) put on supporting beam, 2) switch engine off and remove",

The very first sentence of the context says: \"We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.\"\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. The phrase \"flowrate\" here likely refers to the kg/min measurement since the question is about kg/min. The sentence directly states that if the flowrate is below 40 kg/min, the fine application should be used. \n\nI should check the rest of the context to ensure there's no other mention of a different threshold. Scanning through, there's a part about very low application rates less than 25 kg/ha, but that's in kg/ha, not kg/min. The question specifically asks about kg/min, so that's a different metric. \n\nAnother part mentions a relevant flowrate of 3.7 kg/min, but that's an example for a specific case (23 kg/ha application rate) and not the threshold for using the fine application. The main instruction is in the first sentence. \n\nSo the exact answer should be 40 kg/min. The question asks \"below which application rate\" to use the fine application, so the threshold is 40.

This connection is located at the back of the control box.\"\n\nThat seems to directly answer the question. The key phrase here is \"serial port with an RS 232 connection.\" The answer should specify the exact type mentioned, which is RS 232. I need to make sure there's no other mention of different serial connections elsewhere. \n\nChecking the rest of the context, there's a mention of a \"9 point CAN plug\" but that's in the context of the tractor ECU, which might be a different connection type.

The question specifies manual loading, which is exactly one of the scenarios mentioned here. The threshold given is more than 1250 mm. Since the question asks for the maximum distance before a platform is mandatory, the answer would be that the maximum allowed distance without needing a platform is just under 1250 mm. But wait, the question is phrased as \"the maximum distance... before a platform is mandatory.\" So if the distance is more than 1250, the platform is required. Therefore, the threshold is 1250 mm. The answer should be 1250 mm because exceeding that requires the platform. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of this value elsewhere.

Let me scan the text again. \n\nLooking at the context, there's a section that mentions weather conditions: \"Weather conditions have a great influence on the spreading pattern while spreading, as well as while performing the tray test. The tray test should be performed with dry weather, low humidity and with a maximum wind speed of 3 m/s (wind force of 2).\" \n\nThen, further down, under the general instructions, there's a point that says: \"Do not spread with wind speeds of more than 3 m/s (wind force of 2).\" \n\nSo both the tray test and the actual spreading have the same maximum wind speed requirement. The number given is 3 m/s. The question specifically asks for the maximum permissible wind speed for both scenarios, and the context clearly states 3 m/s for both. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other part of the text that mentions a different value. Scanning again, I don't see any other numbers related to wind speed. The answer should be exactly 3 m/s. The user wants the answer in English and based strictly on the context. Since the information is directly stated, I don't need to put \"Unknown\" here. \n\nSo the precise answer is 3 m/s.\n</think>\n\n3 m/s",

I need to look through the provided context to find the exact information related to this.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for mentions of the PTO shaft after disengaging. There are two sections titled \"PTO shaft rotates after disengaging.\" Let me check those. \n\nIn the first section under that heading, it says: \"After switching off the PTO shaft, danger could arise as the machine will continue running because of inertia. Keep a safe distance... Approaching... while it is rotating can cause serious or deadly injuries.\"\n\nThe second section is almost the same, so it's emphasizing the same point. The key points here are that the machine continues running due to inertia, which causes the rotating parts to still be in motion. The danger is the continued rotation from inertia. \n\nThe question asks what the continued danger is and why. The answer should state that the machine continues running (or rotating) because of inertia. The exact wording from the context uses \"machine will continue running because of inertia.\" So the answer should capture that the PTO shaft or machine parts continue moving due to inertia, leading to danger. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is precise and uses the exact terms from the context. The answer should be: \"The machine will continue running because of inertia.\" That's the exact phrase used here.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific precaution to take before welding on a machine that's been used with nitrate-containing fertilizer.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context mentions several times the explosion danger from nitrate fertilizers. The key points here are about removing remnants. Let me check each section again.\n\nUnder the \"Explosion danger because of nitrate\" sections, it says: \"All fertiliser remnants should therefore be removed from voids, corners, tubes and tubing before welding, cutting or grinding on the machine.\" That seems directly relevant. The question is about welding, which is explicitly mentioned here. \n\nI should make sure there's no other precaution mentioned specifically for welding in this context. The other sections talk about preventing unintentional operation and avoiding contact with materials, but those don't relate directly to the nitrate and welding. The main point here is removing the fertilizer remnants before doing any welding, cutting, or grinding. \n\nThe answer needs to be precise and exact. The exact phrase from the context is \"All fertiliser remnants should therefore be removed from voids, corners, tubes and tubing before welding...\" So the answer should state that the specific precaution is removing those remnants from those specific areas. \n\nI don't see any other steps mentioned here related to welding and nitrate. The other precautions like wearing protective gear or disconnecting energy sources are part of general safety but not the specific one related to nitrate and explosion. So the correct answer is the removal of fertiliser remnants from the listed areas before welding.\n</think>\n\nThe specific precaution is to remove all fertiliser remnants from voids, corners, tubes, and tubing before welding.",

I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for mentions of discharge bushings and grease nipples. Looking at line 11: \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\". That's a direct mention. Also, further down in the prose, it says, \"The discharge bushings are attached lower down to the agitator axle and have 2 grease nipples.\" That's another clear statement. \n\nWait, the question is about \"the discharge bushings\" in singular, but the context refers to \"both discharge bushings\" having 2 grease nipples. So does that mean each has 2, or together they have 2? Let me check again. The line says \"both discharge bushings have 2 grease nipples.\" The wording suggests that together, both have 2. But maybe each has 2? Hmm, but the line says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\". That could mean 2 per each? Or total 2? \n\nWait, looking at line 11 again: \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\". The wording here might mean that both together have 2. But then in the prose, it says \"have 2 grease nipples\" when referring to each discharge bushing. Wait, the sentence structure: \"The discharge bushings [...] have 2 grease nipples.\" Since \"discharge bushings\" is plural here, the 2 could be per bushing or total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each discharge bushing has 2. Let me check again. The exact sentence is: \"The discharge bushings are attached lower down to the agitator axle and have 2 grease nipples.\" Since it's plural (bushings), the 2 might be per unit. Wait, but the phrasing is ambiguous. However, line 11 says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\" which could mean that both together have 2. But in the prose, when instructing, it says \"grease the 2 nipples of both discharge bushings.\" So \"both\" have 2 in total. Wait, that would mean each has 1? No, the instruction says \"both\" and \"2 nipples\". So maybe each has 2, making total 4? But the context says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\" which would be 2 total. Hmm, conflicting interpretations. \n\nWait, looking at line 11 again: \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\" – that's probably 2 per each? Or total? The wording is a bit unclear. But in the prose, it says \"the discharge bushings [...] have 2 grease nipples.\" Since they are plural, maybe each has 2, so total 4? But the instruction says \"grease the 2 nipples of both discharge bushings\" which would imply that both together have 2. That would mean each has 1? No, that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each discharge bushing has 2, so two bushings would have 2 each, totaling 4. But the context says \"both discharge bushings have 2 grease nipples.\" That could mean each has 2. Wait, the exact line from the prose: \"The discharge bushings [...] have 2 grease nipples.\" Since it's plural, maybe each has 2. But the instruction says \"both\" and \"2 nipples\". Maybe the total is 2 for both. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 2 per discharge bushing. Wait, looking at line 11 again: \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\". The phrasing here is similar to line 10: \"4 grease nipples on the PTO shaft\" which is a single item. So \"both discharge bushings\" as a group have 2. So each has 1? But the prose says \"have 2 grease nipples\" when referring to the discharge bushings (plural). \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check again. The key line is: \"The discharge bushings are attached lower down to the agitator axle and have 2 grease nipples.\" Since \"discharge bushings\" is plural, the 2 could be per each. Wait, but that would mean each has 2, so total 4. But the line says \"have 2\" in total. Alternatively, maybe each has 1, so two in total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 2. The question is asking \"how many grease nipples do the discharge bushings have?\" So the total number. The context says \"both discharge bushings have 2 grease nipples.\" So the answer is 2. But line 11 says \"2 grease nipples on both discharge bushings\" which also points to 2 total. \n\nWait, the instruction part says: \"gre",

The question is about the 3225 model.\n\nLooking at the rows, there's a section under \"General\" which includes \"Hopper weight\" with two entries: \"Without hopper cover (kg)\" and \"With hopper cover (kg)\". The rows for these are numbered 10 and 11 respectively.\n\nFor the 3225 model, under the \"Without hopper cover (kg)\" row (row 10), the value listed is 337,5 kg. Wait, the numbers are separated by commas, which in some countries denote decimals. But the question asks for the answer in kg, and the format here might be using comma as a decimal separator. However, in the context, the numbers like 277,5 could be 277.5 kg. But the user just wants the exact value from the context, so I should present it as written. \n\nSo the exact value for the 3225 model under \"Without hopper cover (kg)\" is 337,5. The answer should be in English, but the number format might stay as is since it's directly from the context. The user didn't specify converting commas to periods, so I'll keep it as 337,5 kg. Wait, the question says to answer in English, but the context uses commas as decimal separators. Maybe the answer should follow the context's format. The instructions say to base the answer strictly on the context, so 337,5 is correct. \n\nI need to make sure there's no confusion with other rows. The 3225 column under row 10 is indeed 337,5. The other entries for 1875, 2550, 3900 are 277,5; 307,5; 367,5 respectively. So the 3225 is correctly 337,5. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 337,5 kg. But the question asks for \"kg\" so maybe just the number. Wait the question says \"hopper weight without hopper cover in kg\", so the answer is the number from that cell.

Let me parse that again. \n\nLooking at the \"Technical specifications\" section, the rows 0,1,2, etc., have entries like \"Sound level\" with \"Closed cabin\" and \"Rear window opened\". The columns might correspond to different scenarios. For example, under \"Sound level\", the values for Tractor at 540 rpm are 71.9 (closed cabin) and 76.2 (rear window open). \n\nNow, going back to the entry for \"Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60)\", the two values 73.8 and 84.6. The columns here probably correspond to the same conditions as the other entries. Since the first entry under \"Tractor at 540 rpm\" has 71.9 (closed) and 76.2 (open rear window), then the two numbers for the Kali 60 spreader would follow the same pattern. So 73.8 would be for the closed cabin, and 84.6 when the rear window is open. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 84.6 dB when the rear window is opened.\n</think>\n\nThe sound level of a Tractor + spreading spreader (Kali 60) with the rear window opened is **84.6 dB**. \n\n[Exact value extracted from the context's second column under \"Rear window opened\" condition for the specified equipment configuration.]",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know how often the condition of the vanes must be inspected. I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the context for sections related to maintenance intervals. There's a section titled \"Maintenance intervals\" with a table. The table has columns labeled \"da il y\" (probably \"daily\"), \"af te r th e first 10 hou rs\" (after first 10 hours?), \"we ekly\", \"ev ery 100 ho urs\", \"min. 1 x per ye ar\", and \"As r eco mme nde d If worn Page\". \n\nLooking at the rows, row 4 is titled \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle\" and has a checkmark in the first column. Wait, actually, the user is asking about the vanes. Let me check again. \n\nWait, row 3 is \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle\" and row 4 is \"Condition of the vanes\". The entries under the columns: for row 4, there's a checkmark in the first column? Let me parse the text again. The table's columns might be misaligned due to formatting issues. The original text for the table is a bit messy. The line for row 4 says \"Condition of the vanes ·\" followed by some spacing. The symbols (like ·) might indicate which intervals apply. \n\nLooking at the structure:\n\nThe columns seem to be:\n\n- da il y (daily)\n- af te r th e first 10 hou rs (after first 10 hours)\n- we ekly (weekly)\n- ev ery 100 ho urs (every 100 hours)\n- min. 1 x per ye ar (minimum once per year)\n- As recommended\n- If worn\n\nFor row 4 (\"Condition of the vanes\"), the entry starts with \"·\" which might correspond to the first column (daily). But the exact placement is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the \"·\" is under the \"af te r th e first 10 hou rs\" column? The formatting is a bit off. Let me look again at the exact text:\n\nThe line for row 4 is:\n\n3 Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle · \n\nWait, no, the user's context shows:\n\nRow 3: \"Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle · \" (maybe daily?)\n\nRow 4: \"Condition of the vanes · \" followed by more spacing. The exact alignment is hard because of the formatting. The \"·\" might be under the \"daily\" column for row 4. Alternatively, maybe the \"·\" is under the \"after first 10 hours\" column. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the structure, the first column after the item number is \"da il y\", so if the first \"·\" is under that, then the inspection is daily. But the user's question is about vanes. The line for row 4 says \"Condition of the vanes · \" with a · in the first column (daily). But maybe the \"·\" is in the \"after first 10 hours\" column? The text is a bit jumbled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct interval is \"weekly\" or \"every 100 hours\". Wait, the user's context has a line that says \"ev ery 100 ho urs\" as a column. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the exact text:\n\nThe line for row 4 is:\n\n3 Condition of the agitator and the agitator axle · \n\n4 Condition of the vanes · \n\nThe \"·\" for row 4 might be under the \"da il y\" column. But maybe the \"·\" is under the \"after first 10 hours\" column. The exact alignment is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the \"·\" in row 4 is under the \"da il y\" column, meaning daily. But the user's question is about the inspection interval for vanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Condition of the vanes\" is checked weekly. Let me check the exact text again. The columns are:\n\nThe headers are: da il y (daily), af te r th e first 10 hou rs (after first 10 hours), we ekly (weekly), ev ery 100 ho urs (every 100 hours), min. 1 x per ye ar (min once per year), etc. \n\nLooking at the line for row 4:\n\n\"Condition of the vanes · \" followed by some spacing. The \"·\" might be under the \"da il y\" column. So the answer would be \"daily\". But maybe the \"·\" is under the \"after first 10 hours\"",

The user is asking for the torque required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and a 0.13 friction coefficient. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context has two main sections: one for regular steel and another for stainless steel. Since the question specifies a steel bolt (not stainless), I should focus on the first section under \"Steel tightening torques\".\n\nLooking at the table for steel, the qualities listed are 4.6, 8.8, 10.9, 12.9. The user's bolt is 10.9, so that's the row we need. The columns are for different M sizes and friction coefficients. The friction coefficients mentioned are 0.10 and 0.13. The question specifies 0.13, so we need the column under 0.13 for 10.9 quality.\n\nNow, checking the M sizes in the steel table. The rows are labeled with numbers (like 0, 1, 9, 10) but the M sizes listed are M5, M6, then jumping to M22 and M24 in rows 9 and 10. Wait, that's a problem. The user is asking about M18, which isn't listed here. The table skips from M6 to M22, so there's a gap. \n\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first table under steel has the first row (row 0) as M5, then maybe row 1 is missing? The next entries after row 0 are row 9 (M22) and row 10 (M24). That's odd. There's no M18 in the steel table. The stainless steel table has entries down to M6, but the steel table doesn't list M18. \n\nSince the question is about steel, not stainless, and M18 isn't present in the steel section's tables, the answer might not be found here. The instructions say to answer \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" if unsure. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The steel table's rows after the first few are numbered 9 and 10 for M22 and M24. There's no M18. The user is asking for M18, which isn't listed.

The user is asking for the torque required to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and a 0.2 friction coefficient. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context has two main sections: one labeled \"Stainless steel tightening torques\" and another \"Steel tightening torques\". Since the question specifies a stainless steel bolt, I should focus on the first section under \"Stainless steel tightening torques\".\n\nLooking at the table under that section, the columns are for different qualities and friction coefficients. The question mentions \"70 (A2)\" which is a stainless steel grade. The friction coefficient here is 0.20. \n\nIn the Stainless steel section, the columns are:\n- Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.70 (A2).0.10. Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.70 (A2).0.30. etc.\n\nLooking at the row for M6, the values are:\nM6 | 6.3 | 9.9 | 12.2 | 8.4 | 16.3 | ...\n\nThe columns after \"70 (A2)\" start with 0.10, 0.20, 0.30.

The filling levels and widths are in cm, so those aren't power figures. \n\nWait, maybe the tractor power (kW) is listed elsewhere? The first table's row 7 also mentions \"Tractor power (kW)\" but it's empty. The columns under Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD have numbers like 1875, which might be the hopper's capacity, not power.

The bullet points under \"A connection set is supplied as a standard item with the IsoMatch for:\" include ISO 11786, lights, ignition, Tractor CAN, and video input. So the \"other\" connections besides the main ones (like the 9-point cab cable) would be those four. But the question is specifically about the Input IM Tellus cable's other uses. The context also mentions that the power cable set for non-ISO tractors has the same connections as the Input cable. So the answer should list the four items from the bullet points.

The exact lines: \"A connection set is supplied as a standard item with the IsoMatch for: · ISO 11786 In cab · lights and ignition · Tractor CAN (optional plug specific to the tractor required) · Video input.\" Since the question is about \"other\" connections besides maybe the primary ones, but the Input cable is used for these.

Wait, but ISO 11786 is part of the connection set. Since the question is about \"other\" connections, maybe excluding ISO 11786? The first mention says \"Other connections are made via the Input IM Tellus\", so the primary connection (maybe the 9-point cab cable) is separate, and the Input cable handles the others. So the answer includes the four bullet points except ISO 11786? Wait, the bullet points include ISO 11786 as part of the connection set. The question is about the Input cable's uses. The first line says \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable\", so the primary connection (like the 9-point in cab) is separate, and the Input cable is for the others. The bullet points list the four items including ISO 11786. Wait, but the first sentence says \"Other connections are made via the Input IM Tellus\", so the main connection (the 9-point in cab) is via that cable, and the Input cable is for other connections. Wait, the context says: \"If your tractor is provided with a complete ISOBUS connection, a connection with the 9-pins in Cab cable between your tractor and the IsoMatch control box is sufficient. Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" So the 9-pin is for the ISOBUS, and the Input cable is for other connections. The bullet points under the connection set include ISO 11786 (which is part of the in-cab), but the Input cable's other connections would be the rest. Wait, the bullet points are part of the connection set supplied with IsoMatch, which includes ISO 11786, lights, ignition, Tractor CAN, and video. Since the Input cable is used for the other connections besides the 9-pin, then the other connections (the ones the Input cable handles) are the four items except ISO 11786? Or including it? Hmm, maybe the ISO ",

The context doesn't explicitly mention what to do if a physician isn't available. The instructions say to \"contact your physician in such an event,\" but there's no alternative provided if that's not possible. \n\nLooking further, there's a part under \"Read the safety instructions provided by the supplier\" which mentions wearing protective clothing and adhering to the supplier's instructions.

The \"Chemical reactions caused by mixing fertilisers\" part warns about mixing fertilizers but again, not about the immediate action after contact.\n\nSince the context strictly says to contact a physician but doesn't provide an alternative when unavailable, the answer might be that there's no specified action given in the text.

I need to find the exact information from the provided context that answers this.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context looking for parts that mention the consequences of not lubricating the grease nipples. The context talks about the advantages of the working order, which includes lubricating the nipples. The advantages listed are additional checks, ensuring longevity, and less delays. But that's the positive side. The question is about the negative outcome of not doing it.\n\nLooking further, under the Maintenance section, there's a part about lubricating points. It says that all lubricating nipples should be filled with universal grease. Then, in the Storing the machine section, it mentions that lubricating first prevents dirt, fertiliser, and water from entering the bearings. Also, after cleaning, they recommend greasing again for conservation. \n\nThe key part here is: \"If it is lubricated first you will prevent dirt, fertiliser and water from entering the bearings.\" So, if they are never lubricated, the opposite would happen—dirt and moisture would enter. Additionally, the context mentions that not lubricating could lead to problems causing delays, which are mentioned as one of the advantages avoided. \n\nAnother part says, \"When using a high-pressure cleaner, do not aim it at the seals and the breathers. That way you will prevent dirt and moisture from entering the gearboxes.\" But that's about cleaning method, not directly about lubrication. However, combining the info from the storage and maintenance sections, the main consequence is that dirt and moisture would enter the bearings, leading to potential damage and reduced machine longevity. \n\nThe exact answer should be derived from the context's statements. The context explicitly states that lubricating prevents dirt and moisture from entering the bearings. Therefore, not lubricating would result in those substances entering, which would likely cause issues like wear, corrosion, or failure. The answer should reflect the prevention part turned into a negative outcome.\n</think>\n\ndirt, fertiliser and water enter the bearings",

The question is about the training program's curriculum required for agrarians.\n\nLooking at the sections, the \"Target group of this manual\" mentions that the manual is intended for agrarians and others trained in agriculture who are competent to operate these machines as per national legislation and have knowledge of assembly activities. \n\nThe \"For your safety\" section emphasizes that users must be familiar with the manual's contents, including safety requirements, traffic regulations, and understanding the machine's systems and controls. The \"Responsibility of the user\" lists several points the user must fulfill, such as being familiar with safety requirements, traffic regulations, having proper instruction, understanding the manual, knowing the systems and functions, and understanding usage, maintenance, and repair requirements.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the curriculum of the training program.

The context under the \"Avoid contact with materials\" section under Safety (section 22) says to wear protective clothing including safety gloves. However, the context doesn't specify the exact type of gloves, just \"safety gloves.\" There's no mention of any specific material like heat-resistant or chemical-resistant gloves. \n\nThe question is asking for the kind of gloves needed specifically for cleaning before welding.

Since the answer must be strictly based on the context, and the context doesn't specify beyond \"safety gloves,\" the answer should reflect that. \n\nWait, but maybe the explosion danger part implies that the gloves need to protect against both chemicals and heat? However, the context doesn't state that. The safety instructions for cleaning mention safety gloves, shoes, and goggles, but the explosion part talks about removing the fertiliser before doing any welding. The actual cleaning step (before welding) requires the safety gloves as per the \"Avoid contact with materials\" section.

The only material mentioned related to clamps is stainless steel for the hose clamps. \n\nWait, maybe \"hose coupling support\" refers to the clamps? But the exact term \"hose coupling support\" isn't in the text. The question might be using different terminology. Since the context doesn't mention a \"hose coupling support\" by that exact name, and the materials mentioned are stainless steel for clamps and check chains without material specified, perhaps the answer isn't present. \n\nThe instructions say to use stainless steel clamps, but that's for the hose clamps, not the support.

I need to find the exact number from the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the context again to make sure I don't miss anything. The first bullet point says that if 80-100% of the granules are between 2.0 and 4.75 mm, the fertilizer is good to spread. That upper limit here is 4.75 mm. \n\nThen, the second bullet mentions that if 20% or more are over 4.75 mm, distribution is difficult and might damage crops. So the problem starts when granules are larger than 4.75 mm. The question is about preventing blockage, which is related to the upper size limit. The context doesn't mention \"blockage\" explicitly, but the issue with granules over 4.75 mm leading to distribution problems and crop damage is the closest. Since the acceptable range is up to 4.75 mm for the majority (80-100%), the maximum acceptable size to avoid issues would be 4.75 mm. \n\nI should check if there's any other part of the text that mentions a different number. The image reference has a distribution example (0-70-30-0), but that doesn't specify a different maximum. The other sections talk about granules under 2 mm being problematic, but that's the lower limit, not the upper. \n\nThe key point is the 4.75 mm threshold. Since the question is about the maximum to prevent blockage (which is implied by the distribution difficulty), the answer should be 4.75 mm. The context doesn't use the exact term \"blockage,\" but the distribution issues and damage from large granules are the closest indicators. Following the instructions strictly, I have to base the answer solely on the given context.

The user is asking for the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for the application rate. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided context carefully. The key section here is under \"Setting the hydraulic border spreading plate\" where instructions mention adjusting the PTO shaft RPM and driving speed. \n\nLooking at the points listed there: \n\n- The correct PTO shaft rpm is the standard value minus 25%, which is calculated as 540 rpm - 25% = 400 rpm. \n- Then it says to select a gear that ensures driving at the same speed as with the normal PTO shaft, or reduce the application rate by 25%. \n\nWait, the question is about driving speed reduction. The PTO is reduced by 25%, but the instruction gives two options: either drive at the same speed as normal PTO (which would imply not reducing speed but lowering PTO) or reduce the application rate by 25%. However, the application rate here might be linked to the PTO speed. \n\nBut the user is specifically asking about the driving speed. The context says \"select a gear that would ensure that you drive at the same speed as with the normal PTO shaft, or reduce the application rate by 25%.\" Hmm, so if you keep the driving speed the same as normal, you have to lower the PTO. Alternatively, if you don't adjust the PTO (maybe keep it at normal speed?), then you need to reduce the application rate by 25%? \n\nWait, maybe the driving speed is being adjusted. The PTO is set to 75% of normal (since 540 -25% is 400). But the application rate is tied to both PTO speed and driving speed. The control system adjusts the dosing units so that the actual rate matches the set rate through the lower PTO RPM. \n\nThe question is about the driving speed reduction percentage. The instruction says to either drive at the same speed as normal PTO (so no reduction) or reduce the application rate by 25%. But the user is asking for the speed reduction needed to compensate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the driving speed is supposed to be adjusted by 25%? Wait, the PTO is reduced by 25% (from 540 to 400). The application rate is dependent on both PTO RPM and driving speed. If the PTO is lower, but driving speed is kept the same, then the application rate would be lower. To compensate, perhaps the driving speed isn't reduced, but the PTO is. \n\nWait the question is about the driving speed reduction. The context says \"select a gear that would ensure that you drive at the same speed as with the normal PTO shaft, or reduce the application rate by 25%.\" So if you want to keep the application rate correct, you can either keep the driving speed the same but lower the PTO, or if you don't adjust the PTO, you have to reduce the application rate (maybe by adjusting the dosing). \n\nBut the user is asking for the optimal driving speed reduction percentage. The context doesn't explicitly state a percentage for driving speed reduction. It mentions reducing PTO RPM by 25%, but driving speed is either kept the same or the application rate is adjusted. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 25% because the PTO is reduced by 25%, but the question is about driving speed. Alternatively, perhaps the driving speed isn't reduced, but the PTO is. The question might be a bit ambiguous. \n\nLooking again at the exact wording: \"select a gear that would ensure that you drive at the same speed as with the normal PTO shaft, or reduce the application rate by 25%.\" So the user has two options: either keep the driving speed same (so no reduction) but lower PTO, or if they don't lower PTO, then reduce application rate. \n\nThe question is about the optimal driving speed reduction to compensate. Since the PTO is being reduced by 25%, perhaps the driving speed is kept the same. Therefore, the driving speed reduction percentage isn't mentioned here. Wait, but maybe the answer is that there's no speed reduction needed, but the PTO is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is supposed to reduce the driving speed by 25%? But the context says \"reduce the application rate by 25%\". The application rate is a combination of speed and PTO. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is that the driving speed should not be reduced, but the PTO is. The question is about the driving speed reduction percentage. Since the instruction says you can drive at the same speed as normal PTO, then the reduction is 0%. But that contradicts the PTO being lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the application rate is",

The user is asking about the distance tolerance in meters from the field edge when driving the 'first path' for border spreading. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The question is specifically about the distance during the first path of border spreading. Let me scan the context sections related to border spreading methods.\n\nIn the context, there are two methods mentioned: one-sided boundary spreading with the hydraulic border spreading plate and boundary track spreading with ExactLine. The user's question is about the first path's distance, so I need to check both methods for any mention of distance from the edge.\n\nLooking at the section under \"Use in the field\" on page 98, there's a part about working without sprayer tramlines (situation B). Here, it says: \"Drive the first path with the middle of the tractor about 2 metres from the field edge.\" That seems relevant. The key point here is the 2 metres distance. \n\nAdditionally, under the boundary track spreading with ExactLine, it mentions driving half the working width from the field edge (1/2 X meters). But the question is about the first path's distance tolerance. The part about situation B specifies \"about 2 metres\" which includes the tolerance. The word \"about\" might imply a small tolerance, but the exact number given is 2 meters. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the distance tolerance. The context says \"about 2 metres\". The term \"about\" could mean there's a tolerance range, but the context doesn't specify a numerical tolerance beyond that. The exact figure given is 2 meters. Since the question is about the tolerance, maybe the answer is 2 meters. But the problem is whether \"about\" indicates a tolerance. However, the context doesn't state a specific tolerance value like +/- 0.5m or anything. \n\nAlternatively, in the first method (boundary track with ExactLine), the first path is set at half the working width (1/2 X meters). But that's a different scenario. The question might be referring to the situation B scenario where it's 2 meters. \n\nThe user's question is specifically about the \"first path\" for border spreading. The context under situation B says the first path is driven with the tractor's middle about 2 meters from the edge. Since the question asks for the distance tolerance, but the context only mentions \"about 2 metres\" without specifying a numerical tolerance range, perhaps the answer is 2 meters. However, the exact wording is important here. The question is about the tolerance, but maybe the answer is simply 2 meters as that's the specified distance. Alternatively, if \"about\" implies a tolerance, but since there's no exact number given, maybe the answer is 2 meters. \n\nLooking again at the instructions, the user wants an exact answer based on the context. Since the context states \"about 2 metres\", the exact figure given is 2 meters. The tolerance might be inferred as that value. Since the question is about the distance tolerance, but the context doesn't mention a range, perhaps the answer is 2 meters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first path in the ExactLine method is 1/2 X meters, but that depends on the working width. The question is general, so the answer from situation B is 2 meters. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2 meters.\n</think>\n\n2",

It doesn't mention any specific angle like 10 degrees. The instructions emphasize a level surface. So, if the parking support is on a slope, even 10 degrees, that's not level. The context doesn't provide info on angles, so the answer might be unknown. But I need to check again.\n\nLooking again: \"Place the machine on a stable, level base.\" There's no mention of slopes or angles. The user's question is about a 10-degree slope.

The third entry under row 4 might say \"every 100 hours\" because of \"ev ery 100 ho urs\". The maintenance for vanes (row 4) is listed under a column that mentions every 100 hours. But does that mean they should be checked every 100 hours, or replaced? The row heading is \"Condition of the vanes\", so it's about checking their condition. The tip mentions exchanging vanes over a period but doesn't give exact hours. \n\nThe question is about when they require replacement. The context doesn't explicitly state a specific operational hour threshold before replacement. The maintenance intervals suggest checking every 100 hours, but replacement might depend on wear, which is mentioned in the tips. Since the exact number of hours before replacement isn't directly given, the answer might be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\". \n\nWait, the maintenance table's last column under row 4 might have \"If worn\" which implies replacement when worn, but the operational hours aren't specified.

The context lists various cables and mentions an \"IsoMatch power cable set,\" but still no numerical value for the extension cable's length. \n\nThe question specifically asks for the length in meters, but after reviewing all relevant parts, there's no exact number provided. The terms like \"short\" and \"extended\" are used descriptively, but without exact measurements.

But wait, the text doesn't specify how long that test period is. It just says there's a free test period, but the exact duration in days isn't mentioned anywhere. \n\nI'll scan the context again to make sure I didn't miss any numbers or references to days. The rest of the text talks about features of the software, the control unit, and instructions for calibration, but there's no mention of the test period's length. The pages referenced (like page 76) aren't accessible here, so I can't check there. \n\nSince the information isn't present in the given context, the correct answer should be that it's not specified here.

The context mentions the hopper empty sensor in the Accessories section on page 148. The exact sentence says: \"The sensor usually comes with the valve set.\" \n\nHmm, that's the only mention of the valve set here. The context doesn't specify the type of valve or the manufacturer. It just states that the sensor comes with a valve set. There's no additional information about the valve's brand or type elsewhere in the provided pages. \n\nLooking at page 149, the details there are about the agitator axle, maintenance steps, and some measurements, but nothing about valves or manufacturers. The terms like ExactLine are mentioned, but that's a product name for a spreading tool, not related to the valve set.\n\nSince the question is about the valve set's type and manufacturer, and the context doesn't provide those specifics, the answer should be that the information isn't present here.

The user is asking for the drain rate in liters per minute of the drain kit used for hopper emptying. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context has two pages: 149 and 150. \n\nOn page 149, there's mention of a drain kit: \"A drain kit is available for emptying the hopper quickly.\" But there's no number or rate specified here. The page talks about the calibration container and the purpose of the drain kit, but no details on the drain rate.\n\nMoving to page 150, it's about technical specifications for the Exacta-TLX GEOSPREAD models. The tables list hopper capacity (in liters), filling levels, widths, and weights. The columns have values like 1875, 2550, etc., which are likely the hopper capacities. There's a \"Maximum load capacity\" of 3900 kg, but that's weight, not a drain rate. \n\nI don't see any mention of liters per minute or a drain rate figure in either page. The drain kit is mentioned only in passing on page 149 without specifics. The technical specs on 150 don't include a drain rate either. \n\nSince the question is about the drain rate (liters per minute) and there's no data provided in the context about the rate at which the drain kit operates, the answer should be that it's not found in the given information.

First, I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nStarting from the top, under the \"Accessories\" section, there are entries for Hopper extensions, Hopper cover, Electric hopper cover, and Pellet sieve. The question is about the sail material of the hopper cover. \n\nLooking at the paragraphs mentioning the hopper cover: \"The sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening.\" Here, \"sail\" is mentioned in relation to the hopper cover. The next sentence says the electric hopper cover's cover can be opened electrically, but that might not refer to the sail. \n\nContinuing down, under \"Before first use\" for Hopper extensions, there's a part about a corner part with a covering baffle, but that's an image description. Then, in the details about the hopper cover installation, it mentions edges consisting of parts like long sides, short sides, corner parts, caps, and fixing material. However, none of these mention the material of the sail.\n\nLooking further, the context discusses weights in the table (rows 10-12) but no material info. The term 'sail' is only mentioned once in the context: \"The sail can be folded back for a larger filler opening.\" There's no mention of UV resistance anywhere in the text provided. \n\nSince the context doesn't specify the material of the sail or its UV resistance, the answer should be that the information isn't found in the provided text.
