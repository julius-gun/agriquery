The first check is after the first hour, and then weekly. But the question is specifically about after initial setup and after maintenance. The initial setup would be the first check after the first hour. Then, after any maintenance or repairs, they should check again. The context says to check regularly at least weekly.

The user is asking about the specific height in centimeters the spreading disc should be set to above the troughs before testing the ExactLine spreading pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context mentions a few things related to settings. There's a part that says, \"During the tray test the disc height above the troughs was set to 75 cm.\" That seems directly relevant. \n\nThen, later in the French section, it states, \"hauteur du disque d'épandage = 75 cm au-dessus des bacs de collecte.\" Translating that, it's the same as 75 cm above the troughs. \n\nThe question is specifically about the height setting before testing. The context mentions that during the tray test, the disc height was set to 75 cm above the troughs. Since the tray test is part of the setup before testing the spreading pattern, this seems to be the correct value. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of height. The user also mentions adjusting the ExactLine 1 setting, but that's about the working width, not the height. The other parts talk about hydraulic settings and pressure, but not the disc height. \n\nSo the answer should be 75 cm.

The relevant part is under \"PTO shaft rotates after disengaging.\" It says that after switching off the PTO shaft, the machine might continue running due to inertia. The danger here is that the moving parts haven't stopped yet, so approaching the machine could lead to serious or deadly injuries. \n\nThe key points here are inertia causing the machine to continue running and the risk of injury from approaching while parts are still moving. The answer needs to be precise and concise, directly addressing the question. I should make sure not to include any extra information not related to the question. The answer should mention the continued rotation due to inertia and the potential for injury. Let me check if there's any other part of the context that might add more info, but it seems the main point is covered there.

So if the middle trough is 100%, the first is 10%, meaning 90% is lost? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read.\n\nThe text says: \"the quantity of fertiliser in the 1st trough... must be a maximum of 10% of the quantity collected in the trough in the middle of the track (= 100%).\" So the first trough is 10% of the middle trough. Therefore, the loss would be the middle trough quantity minus the first trough quantity. But the question is about the maximum allowed loss of the middle trough's quantity. Wait, maybe the loss is the amount that's lost from the middle trough to the ditch. Wait, the first trough is in the imaginary ditch, so maybe the loss is the amount that's not reaching the first trough. But the wording is a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. The first trough's quantity must be a maximum of 10% of the middle trough's quantity. So the loss would be the middle trough's quantity minus the first trough's quantity. If the first is 10%, then the loss is 90%? But that seems high. Wait, maybe the loss is the amount that's lost in the ditch, which is the difference between the middle trough and the first trough. If the first is 10% of the middle, then the loss is 90% of the middle. But the question is asking for the maximum fertilizer loss allowed in the ditch. The context says the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. Then it specifies that the first trough must be a maximum of 10% of the middle trough. So the loss is the amount that's not in the first trough, which would be 90% of the middle trough's quantity. But the question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" So the answer would be 10%? Wait, no. Wait, the first trough is 10% of the middle, so the loss is 90%? But the context says the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. Then the first trough must be a maximum of 10% of the middle. So the loss is the amount that's not in the first trough, which is 90% of the middle. But the question is asking for the maximum allowed loss. Wait, maybe the loss is the amount that's lost in the ditch, which is the difference between the middle and the first. If the first is 10% of the middle, then the loss is 90% of the middle. But the question is phrased as \"maximum fertilizer loss of the quantity in the middle trough in percent allowed in a ditch.\" So the answer would be 10%? Wait, no. Let me think again. The first trough is 10% of the middle. So the loss is the middle minus the first, which is 90% of the middle. But the question is asking for the maximum allowed loss. The context says the maximum acceptable loss in the ditch is determined by environmental standards. Then it says the first trough must be a maximum of 10% of the middle. So the",

The user is asking from which machine point the spreading height is measured to the ground or the crop. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context carefully. The context has several parts, but I should focus on the sections related to measuring height. \n\nIn the first part, there's a mention of \"Measured from the bottom of the vanes, the distance to the ground or the crop must be 75 cm.\" The vanes here are likely part of the spreader mechanism. The question is about the machine point from which the height is measured. The key phrase here is \"from the bottom of the vanes.\" \n\nI should check if there are other mentions of measurement points. Later, there's a part about the spreader being set horizontally with the lift rod adjustment and top link. But that's more about positioning rather than the measurement point. \n\nAnother section talks about the spreader's width being determined by the disk's speed, but that's unrelated to height measurement. The part about the linkage pins and spreading charts refers to adjusting the spreader's position, but again, not the measurement point. \n\nThe mention of \"point d'écoulement\" (flow point) in French might be relevant, but the context in English says the height is measured from the bottom of the vanes. Since the question is in English, the answer should be in English. \n\nSo, the direct answer from the context is that the height is measured from the bottom of the vanes. I need to make sure there's no other point mentioned. The answer should be precise and concise, as per the instructions.

That might not be the dB values. \n\nWait, maybe the columns are for different models or configurations. Let me check the structure again. \n\nLooking at row 1: the first column (column 0) is \"Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD\", then column 1 is \"Cabine fermée\", column 2 is \"Vitre arrière ouverte\". Then in row 2, the Tracteur tournant à 540 tr/min (dB) has 71.9 under column 0 and 76.2 under column 1. Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe the columns are for different models or different configurations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns 0, 1, 2 are different scenarios. For example, in row 1, the \"Niveau sonore\" has three entries: 0, 1, 2. Maybe each column represents a different condition. \n\nWait, looking at row 1, the first entry is \"Exacta-TLX-GEOSPREAD\" (model name), then \"Niveau sonore\" with options for Cabine fermée and Vitre arrière ouverte. Then in row 2, the Tracteur tournant à 540 tr/min (dB) has values 71.9 and 76.2. Maybe the columns 0, 1, 2 are different models or different configurations. \n\nThis is getting confusing.

The user is asking about the torque in Nm required to fasten a M18 hexagon steel bolt with a 10.9 quality and 0.13 friction.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information. The context mentions \"Guidelines for torques (in Nm) for self-locking nuts, hexagon bolts and nuts.\" Then there's a table with various torque values. Let me parse that.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows are for different bolt sizes (M5, etc.), and columns for different quality grades and friction coefficients. The entries are in the format: Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques. Then numbers like 4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. etc. Wait, maybe the numbers are for different grades. Let me try to structure this.\n\nThe first line after the guidelines says: \"Quality.Friction *.Thread Torques.4.6.0,10. Torques.4.6.0,13. Torques.8.8.0,10. Torques.8.8.0,13. Torques.10.9.0,10.

The numbers after each quality might be the torque values for that quality and friction. For example, \"Torques.4.6.0,10\" might be 4.6 quality with 0.10 friction, and the value is 1,7 (which is 1.7 Nm for M5). But the user is asking about M18, not M5. However, the table only shows M5. \n\nWait, the context might have more data. Let me check again. The user's question is about M18, but the context only shows M5 in the table. The rest of the context includes some French text about spreading and adjusting, which seems unrelated. The rest of the pages mention images, manuals, etc., but no more torque data. \n\nSo, the table only has M5 data. The user is asking about M18. Since the context doesn't mention M18, there's no information provided for that size. Therefore, the answer should be \"Unknown\" or \"Not found in context\" as per the instructions. \n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first part lists torque values for different qualities and frictions, but the numbers after each quality might be the torque values for different sizes. Wait, the line after the list says \"0                         M5               1,7                 2                 5                 6                  7                  8                  9                 10\". The first column is 0, then M5, then numbers like 1,7 (which is 1.7 Nm), then 2, 5, 6, etc. These numbers might correspond to different friction coefficients or quality grades. \n\nBut the user is asking for M18. Since the table only has M5, there's no data for M18. Therefore, the answer is not found in the context.

The user is asking for the torque in Nm needed to fasten a M6 hexagon stainless steel bolt with a 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context provided. The context has two main sections: one for stainless steel torques and another for steel tightening torques. The question specifies stainless steel, so I should focus on the first section.\n\nIn the stainless steel section, the quality is listed as 70 (A2), and under friction 0.20, there's a line for M6. Let me check the numbers. The line for M6 under 70 (A2) and 0.20 friction shows the torque as 13.2 Nm. Wait, looking back at the context, the exact line is \"Torques.70 (A2).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.10. Torques.80 (A4).0.20. Torques.80 (A4).0.30.\" Then the M6 row under 70 (A2) 0.20 is 13.2. \n\nWait, the context has a table where for M6, under 70 (A2) and 0.20 friction, the value is 13.2. Let me confirm.

First, I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nThe context mentions several cables and connections. The IM Tellus Input cable is mentioned as a standard item. It says other connections are made via the \"Input IM Tellus\" cable. Then there's a part about the IsoMatch power cable set for non-ISO tractors. Also, there's a mention of a connection set for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about the IM Tellus Input cable. The context says that other connections are made via the \"Input IM Tellus\" cable. Then later, it mentions that if the tractor doesn't have ISO 11786 in cab, the same cable is used. Also, there's a part about the power cable set for non-ISO tractors, but that's a different cable. \n\nLooking for other connections that the IM Tellus Input cable can handle. The context says that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. Wait, but the question is about other connections beyond the standard ones. Wait, the first part says \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable...\" which might mean that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those other connections. \n\nWait, the answer needs to be precise. The context says that the Input IM Tellus cable is part of the standard connection set for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. But the question is asking for other kinds of connections that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Input IM Tellus cable can be used for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. But the question is phrased as \"other kind of connections\" implying beyond the standard ones. Wait, the context says \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable, supplied as a standard item.\" So maybe the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those other connections. But the exact answer needs to be extracted. \n\nLooking back, the context mentions that the Input IM Tellus cable is part of the standard connection set for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. So the answer would be that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. But the question is asking for other kinds of connections. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those specific connections. The exact answer should be the list mentioned in the context. Let me check again.\n\nIn the context, under \"Input IM Tellus with ISO11786 In cab connection\", it says a connection set is supplied as a standard item with IsoMatch for: ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. So the Input IM Tellus cable is part of that set. Therefore, the answer is that the IM Tellus Input cable can be used for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input. But the question is about other connections. Wait, the first part says \"Other connections are made via the 'Input IM Tellus' cable...\" which might mean that the Input IM Tellus cable is used for those other connections. But the exact answer is the list mentioned in the context. So the answer should be the list of connections mentioned in the context under the Input IM Tellus section.\n</think>\n\nThe IM Tellus Input cable can be used for ISO 11786 In cab, lights and ignition, Tractor CAN (optional), and video input connections.",

You must first repair the damage or have it repaired before continuing with spreading.\"\n\nSo the direct answer here is that the damage is caused by a hard object. The context explicitly states that when such damage is observed, the failure is most likely due to a hard object. The rest of the text talks about steps to check and repair, but the cause is clearly stated as a hard object. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information contradicting this.

The user is asking for the minimum 'baud rate' for the 'RS 232 connection' based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what baud rate refers to. Baud rate is the rate at which data is transferred, measured in bits per second. However, the context might not mention baud rates directly. Let me scan through the given text.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a mention of an RS 232 connection. The relevant part says: \"The external system and the control system of a spreader with an IsoMatch control box communicate through a serial port with an RS 232 connection. This connection is located at the back of the control box. The occupation of pins in the 9-point RS 23,2 plug and the settings required are given in → the user manual of the IsoMatch control box.\"\n\nWait, the text mentions the RS 232 connection uses a 9-point plug and refers to the user manual for settings. However, there's no explicit mention of the baud rate. The question is about the minimum baud rate, but the context doesn't specify any numerical value for baud rate.

But the question is about the maximum size to prevent blockage. \n\nAnother part mentions: \"If the diameter of 20% or more of the fertiliser granules is greater than 4.75 mm it would be difficult for optimum distribution...\" So, if 20% or more are larger than 4.75 mm, it's problematic. That suggests that having granules larger than 4.75 mm can cause issues. \n\nThe question is about the maximum acceptable size. The context doesn't explicitly state a maximum size, but the part about 4.75 mm being a threshold for difficulty in distribution implies that exceeding this size is bad. However, the answer might be 4.75 mm as the upper limit. \n\nWait, the first part says that if 80-100% are between 2.0 and 4.75, it's good. So the maximum acceptable size in that range is 4.75 mm. But the question is about the maximum to prevent blockage. The context also mentions that if 20% or more are over 4.75, it's difficult. So maybe the maximum acceptable is 4.75 mm. \n\nBut the user is asking for the maximum chunk size to prevent blockage. The context doesn't mention blockage directly, but the part about granules larger than 4.75 causing damage suggests that 4.75 is the upper limit.

Since the context doesn't mention \"connectors\" specifically but talks about general parts, the answer should focus on the grease type mentioned. \n\nThe answer should be concise, so the exact phrase from the context is \"grease that would not harden or dry.\" That's the specific recommendation. I need to make sure there's no other information conflicting or adding more details. The rest of the context talks about maintenance steps but doesn't mention other lubricants.
