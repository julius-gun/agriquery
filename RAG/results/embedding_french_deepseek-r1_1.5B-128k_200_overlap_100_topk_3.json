Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that the context is about dosing openings in a system, probably related to fumigation or vaporization processes. There's mention of opening and closing dosing openings, which makes sense because dosing systems often require precise control over the flow rate.\n\nLooking at the section titled \"Operations avant l'épandage,\" I see that it talks about reglages (adjustments) of the dosing openings. The text mentions that dosing openings can be either opened or closed using specific tools, like a set of images which might refer to the equipment used for adjustment.\n\nIn the fine application section, there's a part that says: \"Pour obtenir dosage fin, un faible débit requiert un orifice plus grand.\" This translates to \"To obtain a fine dosing with a low flow rate, you need a larger opening.\" So this indicates that during fine dosing, they use a larger opening.\n\nThe context also mentions that for fine dosing, all three dosing openings are opened on each disk. That's important because it tells me the exact number of openings being closed—each disk has three openings, and since there are two disks (as per the context), that would be 3 openings per disk times 2 disks, totaling six.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The question is about how many dosing openings are closed during fine application. So if all three on each disk are opened, then yes, it's six in total. There's no mention of closing any, so the answer should be six.\n</think>\n\nSix dosing openings are closed during fine application.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]  \nSix dosing openings are closed during fine application.",

It also talks about various types of engrais and their requirements for nappe d'épandage in different shapes like triangle with complete coverage. \n\nLooking at the images and descriptions, I see that when the écart (which is a measure of the difference between two points) is greater than 25%, certain adjustments are made to the spreading pattern. Specifically, they mention increasing the regime by 50 tr/min and performing tests on the deflection boundary.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern. The context doesn't explicitly state an overlap percentage; it talks more about the shape of the nappe d'épandage and how to adjust it based on écart. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The main points are about coverage (100%), types of engrais with specific shapes, and adjustments when the écart is above 25%. There's no mention of an overlap percentage in these sections.\n\nPerhaps the overlap refers to how much the pattern overlaps itself or extends beyond certain boundaries. But without explicit information on that, I can't find it. The context doesn't provide any data on overlap percentages for full field spreading patterns.\n\nSo, based on what's given, there isn't enough information to determine an overlap percentage for the full field spreading pattern.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are two main sections about fertilizer measurement. The first one talks about a capstone sensor that reduces impact from usage conditions like derriving and soil holes. It corrects factors like conduite and friction on the weight of the product. Then it mentions when the content reaches 100 kg, the command system cuts the automatic layering.\n\nThe second section is about the command system expanding the layer over the entire parcel. It corrects speed but allows manual adjustment of the flow rate. If you pour during expansion, like using a roll to move the layer, they turn off the automatic system. The system weighs the laid material and adjusts based on the desired flow rate.\n\nThe question is about a system that measures fertilizer quantity being spread. From this context, it seems the command system is responsible for measuring the amount of fertilizer being spread. It calculates the weight during expansion by adjusting the flow rate. So the answer should be \"command system\" as it's the one handling the measurement and adjustment.\n</think>\n\nThe system used to measure fertilizer quantity being spread is the command system.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nThe context mentions several points about the spreader's operation. It talks about using a specific type ofengrais with granulométrie and density from the manual tables, both in line and mobile apps for iOS and Android. Then it says that when using an engrais with poor quality, they perform left and right tests each year to control the distribution.\n\nNext, there's a part about the machine having a reference camera to reduce impact factors like reverse tréma and floor gaps during use. It uses the reference camera signal to adjust the spreader's impact factors. When the trémie content drops below 100 kg, the system cuts the automatic calibration. The precision of the measurement decreases as little as when an additional etalon is activated, which takes about two minutes.\n\nThen it mentions that the system can search during epandage using automatic calibration to set the right dosing openings for the desired flow rate. One issue is that the flow rate might go out of control until the second automatic calibration (around 2 minutes). To address this, they suggest entering a starting value from the spreader's table.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are about testing during epandage and using the reference camera for impact reduction. The main question is how often these tests occur. From what I can gather, the automatic calibration tests are performed each year when using poor quality engrais, but there's also a mention of needing to enter starting values from the table.\n\nWait, the context says that during epandage, they search for the right dosing openings by entering the desired flow rate. But it doesn't specify how often these tests happen. It only mentions that two minutes are needed before the second calibration is done. So maybe the automatic calibration isn't a daily test but more of an annual check when using poor quality engrais.\n\nSo, to answer the question: The spreader carries out automatic calibration tests each year when using an engrais with poor quality.\n</think>\n\nThe spreader carries out automatic calibration tests each year when using an engrais with poor quality.",

It mentions that the communication between these systems is done through the ISO bus. \n\nLooking at the question, it's asking how the tractor's speed can be transmitted to IsoMatch without using ISO bus communication. So, if the tractor doesn't use ISO, maybe there are other methods or tools available.\n\nI remember from the context that when a tractor isn't connected via ISO, they might use something called IsoMatch. There's a feature where tractors without their own ISO terminal can function with IsoMatch as a truck. \n\nIn the context, it says that if the tractor lacks ISO communication, you can install a IsoMatch component. This allows the tractor to communicate through IsoMatch. The key part is that they use something called \"IsoMatch Tellus.\" They mention using cables and specific technologies like \"IsoMatch Tellus\" for transmission.\n\nSo, putting this together, when the tractor doesn't have ISO communication, installing IsoMatch components enables the speed to be transmitted via a specialized cable or technology provided by IsoMatch. This way, the tractor's driving speed can still be communicated to IsoMatch even without direct ISO connections.\n</think>\n\nThe tractor's driving speed can be transmitted to IsoMatch using IsoMatch Tellus cables when it lacks ISO communication. \n\nAnswer: IsoMatch Tellus cables are used for transmitting speed via IsoMatch when the tractor doesn't use ISO communication.",

The context also talks about connecting the position sensor to the machine's electrical system.\n\nLooking at the text, it says: \"Raccordez le capteur de position au boîtier comportant l'électronique sur l'épandeur : [Image]. Consultez également les instructions de montage pour réussir le montage.\" So, this part is about setting up the sensor. It mentions that the sensor should be connected to the electrical system of the machine.\n\nI don't see any other references to a position sensor in the context provided. The main focus seems to be on connecting the sensor and ensuring it's properly set up for the ExactLine system. There are parts like the deflection plate, flexibles, and connections mentioned, but nothing about the position sensor specifically.\n\nTherefore, based on the given text, I can conclude that the position sensor should be connected to the electrical system of the machine, likely through a specific connection point or via a cable as per the instructions provided.\n</think>\n\nThe position sensor for the hydraulic border spreading plate should be connected to the electrical system of the machine.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections discussing safety precautions related to machinery and vehicles. The first part talks about placing the machine on a support before working with it next to the tractor. It mentions that the machine can't be lowered if the levaging device isn't properly maintained. So, that's one precaution.\n\nThen, in another section, there are bullet points outlining various precautions. One of them is about verifying if both the tractor and machine comply with road circulation rules before using the public road. Another point is controlling the operation and fixing lighting, air conditioning, protection devices, and braking systems. There's also a precaution to ensure no one is in the working zone while the machine is operating.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks about checking the coupling shaft length. Scanning through the context again, I don't see any mention of the coupling shaft or its length. The sections are more about safety measures related to machinery and vehicle operation, not about the mechanical parts like shafts.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a section that directly addresses this. Let me check again. Oh, wait, in the context provided, it seems that the only mention of checking shafts is in another part of the text, but it's not highlighted as relevant to the question about coupling shaft length.\n\nSo, based on what I have, the safest precaution before working between the tractor and machine isn't explicitly mentioned. The closest is ensuring compliance with road regulations, which might indirectly relate to safety measures that could include checking for proper alignment or connections. But strictly speaking, there's no specific instruction in the context provided about checking the coupling shaft length.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer should be \"No specific precaution is mentioned\" because none of the given context sections address the exact question about the coupling shaft length.\n</think>\n\n[No specific precaution is mentioned]",

Then it lists four more commands: couper le contact sur le tracteur, retirer la clé du contact, serrer le frein à main sur le tracteur, and finally, various actions related to electrical connections.\n\nThe context also mentions that before using the tractor, one should verify if both the tractor and machine meet road circulation rules. It then outlines steps to control the system: verifying, controlling functions like electrical components, fixing air conditioning, freezing, and braking. The last bullet point says \"debranchez les connecteurs électriques et accrochez-les sur le support.\"\n\nSo, the key action here is \"debrancheur les connecteurs électriques\" which means disconnecting the electric connectors and attaching them to a support. This suggests that before engaging any braking systems, it's necessary to ensure that the electrical components are properly disengaged.\n\nThe question is about parking brake engagement. From the context, I don't see an explicit mention of parking brakes being engaged. However, the context does talk about disconnecting electric connectors as part of preparing for use. It might be inferred that engaging a parking brake could interfere with the electrical system, so it's safer to disengage it first.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context and the actions mentioned, the answer should indicate that before connecting the machine, the tractor's electronic systems need to be disengaged, which includes engaging the parking brake if necessary.\n</think>\n\nBefore connecting the machine, the tractor should engage its parking brake to ensure the electrical system is properly disengaged.\n\nANSWER: Before connecting the machine, the tractor should engage its parking brake.",

The formula given is:\n\nVitesse d'écoulement requise = (kg/min)\n\nThen it explains that this involves multiplying three factors: largeur de travail (width in meters), vitesse d'avancement (speed in km/h), and débit (kg per hectare). It also provides an example calculation where 27 meters multiplied by 8 km/h gives 216, which is then divided by 600 to get 9 kg/min. \n\nThe context also mentions a test for automatic scaling using data from the table manual and tests done every 75 kg or every minute. It further explains that the required flow rate isn't directly available in the table of epandage but can be calculated through these methods.\n\nSo, putting this together, the formula seems to be:\n\nFlowrate (kg/min) = Largeur de travail (m) × Vitesse d'avancement (km/h) / 600\n\nThis is because when you multiply width by speed and divide by 600, it gives the flow rate in kg per minute.

The first point is about bad weather conditions with wet air, poor coverage of nappes, and specific instructions for epandage. It mentions that when conditions are favorable, epadging can be done without wind issues.\n\nThe second part talks about positioning bacs at a maximum distance of 4 meters apart. It also advises getting additional bacs if needed for testing large workspaces above 24 meters. Additionally, it warns not to use epandage during bad weather because the engrais (engraved seeds) would remain in the basins, which could cause irregular nappes.\n\nThe key information here is about wind speed restrictions. The context explicitly states that epadging should be done only when conditions are favorable and mentions a maximum wind speed of 5 m/s. It also notes that during bad weather, epandage isn't possible because of the mentioned issues with wet air and poor coverage.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the permissible maximum wind speed for both the tray test and actual spreading is 5 m/s.\n</think>\n\nThe permissible maximum wind speed for both the tray test and actual spreading is 5 m/s.",

The first instruction mentions \"Fermez l'unité de dosage du disque d'épandage droit ou gauche.\" That's about closing the dosage unit on a disk that can be rotated either right or left. Not directly relevant to the question.\n\nNext, it says \"Réglez le distributeur d'engrais à l'aide des données du tableau d'épandage, de la largeur de travail souhaitée et des instructions du chapitre «Épandage unilatéral en bordure» (hauteur du disque d'épandage = 75 cm au-dessus des bacs de collecte).\" Okay, this seems important. It talks about adjusting the distributeur using data from a table, desired width of work, and instructions from chapter \"Épandage unilatéral en bordure.\" The height specified is 75 cm above the basins of collection.\n\nThen it says, \"Positionnez 1 bac de collecte au centre de l'ornière du tracteur. Le centre de l'ornière du tracteur se trouve à 2 mètres de la ligne derrière laquelle la tranchée fictive se trouve.\" This is about positioning the first collection bucket at the center of the end disc, which is two meters away from the line behind where a virtual track starts.\n\nNext, it mentions \"La vitesse d'avancement et le régime de la prise de force doivent être identiques aux valeurs du premier passage.\" So, the speed and force rate must match the first passage values. \n\nLooking at the evaluation section: \"Il est probable que vous trouritez dans les bacs du milieu un débit moins important. La nappe d'épandage ressemble à la nappe d'épandage B du …\" This talks about the discharge rate and mentions nappe B, which is a type of nappe.\n\nThen there's an adaptation section: \"Adaptation. Lorsque l'écart est supérieur à 25 %:  Augmentez le régime du disque d'épandage de 50 tr/min.\" So if the discrepancy is more than 25%, increase the disc rotation rate by 50 tr/min.\n\nFinally, \"Voir le paragraphe «Hauteur d'épandage» page 95. 91\" This refers to a specific paragraph about the height of the epandage above the troughs, which is at 75 cm.\n\nPutting this together, the key point from the context is that for one-sided boundary spreading, the height of the disc above the troughs should be set to 75 cm. The evaluation and adaptation sections talk about how this affects the spread rate and nappe type, but they don't change the required height. So the answer is 75 cm.\n</think>\n\nThe required height of the spreading disc above the troughs for one-sided boundary spreading is 75 cm.\n\nAnswer: 75 cm",

The first part talks about the maximum allowable fertilizer loss in a fictitious ditch. It mentions that the maximum loss is defined by environmental norms. \n\nIn one image section, it says: \"La perte maximale autorisée au-delà de la bordure de parcelle est définie dans une norme environnementale. Pour satisfaire à celle-ci, la quantité d'engrais épandue au-delà de la bordure de parcelle peut représenter 10 % tout au plus de la quantité épandue au centre derrière l'épandeur (= 100%).\"\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n- Maximum loss in a fictitious ditch is defined by environmental norms.\n- For compliance, the loss cannot exceed 10% at the edge of parcelle (bordure de parcelle).\n- The center of the ditch allows up to 100% loss.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the maximum loss in the middle trough. Since the middle is within the parcelle area and not on the edge, it should allow for a higher percentage loss than the edge. But wait, the context doesn't specify an exact figure beyond the 10% limit at the edge. It just states that compliance requires no more than 10% at the edge.\n\nSo, without specific data from the context about the middle trough's maximum allowed loss, I can only state that it must not exceed 10% based on the edge. However, since the question is asking for a precise answer and the context doesn't provide an exact number beyond the 10% limit at the edge, maybe the answer should reflect that the middle allows up to 100%, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, no. The context says that compliance requires no more than 10% at the edge, which means the center can have a higher loss. So, perhaps the maximum allowed in the middle is unlimited beyond what's specified for the edge? Or maybe it's just stated as 100%, but I think the key point is that the edge allows up to 10%.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the question asks about the middle trough, which isn't on the edge. So, according to the context, the maximum loss allowed in the middle should be more than 10%. But since the context doesn't provide an exact number beyond the edge limit, I might have to state that it's not specified and just rely on the information given.\n\nWait, no. The question is asking for the maximum loss allowed in the middle trough, which isn't directly addressed in the context. It only talks about losses at the edge. So perhaps the answer should be that there's no specific limit provided beyond the 10% at the edge, meaning it can be higher.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is simply that the maximum loss allowed in the middle trough isn't specified and could be unlimited based on the context. Alternatively, since the question is about compliance, maybe it's implied to be within the same limit as the center, which would still be 100%.\n\nI think I need to stick with what's given. The context says that at the edge of parcelle (bordure de parcelle), the loss can't exceed 10%. So for the middle trough, which is inside the parcelle area, there's no specific limit mentioned beyond the center. Therefore, perhaps the maximum allowed in the middle isn't specified and could be higher than 10%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe the answer should state that it's not provided in the context, but since the question is about compliance, maybe it's implied to follow the same limit as the center.\n\nI think I'll go with the information given: the maximum loss allowed at the edge of parcelle is 10%, so for the middle trough, which isn't on the edge, there's no specific limit beyond that. Therefore, perhaps the answer should state that it's not specified and could be higher than 10%.\n\nWait, but the question is about the middle trough in percent allowed. Since the context doesn't provide a number for the middle, maybe the answer is simply that it's not provided and can be unlimited based on the edge limit.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum fertilizer loss allowed at the edge of parcelle (bordure de parcelle) is 10%.

The user is instructed to extract precise information based on the given context and provide an answer in English. They also mentioned adhering strictly to the instructions, so I need to focus only on what's relevant.\n\nLooking at the context, it seems like the PTO shaft is being disengaged, which involves several steps: removing the clé (key), siring the frein (hand) on the tractor. The context mentions that after disengaging, certain dangers can occur due to inertia and rotation.\n\nSpecifically, when the machine stops, the force of stopping causes rotational inertia, leading to a temporary danger. If someone is near the machine while it's stopped, they might get close enough to cause injury or death. So, the main danger here is the risk of being in proximity to the machine during stopping, which can lead to severe injuries.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other details. The context also talks about protecting the environment and preventing damage from the machine's rotation after disengagement. But for this question, it's about the immediate danger after disengaging, so focusing on the force of stopping is key.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should state that disengaging the PTO shaft can cause a risk of being near the machine while it stops, leading to potential injuries or death.\n</think>\n\nAfter disengaging the PTO shaft, the main danger is the risk of being in proximity to the machine during stopping due to rotational inertia.",

The first one starts with \"Dernier contrôle du réglage\" and mentions a number 96. It lists several points about setting up the spreader, including whether it's set correctly, the height above the ground or crops, and other details like dosing parameters.\n\nThe second paragraph is labeled \"Avez-vous correctement réglé l'épandeur ? Avez-vous :\", which translates to \"Have you correctly adjusted the spreader?\" It goes into more detail about the settings. The first part of this section talks about whether the height above the ground or crops is set correctly, and mentions using either the tenons of the attachments or adjusting the distributeur de engrais (distributeur of grains) beforehand to match the table.\n\nThe second paragraph then provides specific instructions: \"Avez-vous correctement réglé la hauteur au-dessus du sol ou de la végétation à 75 cm ?\" which translates to \"Have you correctly set the height above the ground or crops to 75 cm?\" It also mentions that if the required height isn't achievable, they can use the tenons of the attachments or adjust the distributeur de grains. Additionally, it asks whether the center of the profile was properly adjusted (GEOPOINT®), and whether the spreader's flow rate is correct.\n\nThe third part of this section says: \"Si la hauteur exigée de 75 cm au-dessus de la végétation n'est pas réalisable avec votre dispositif de levage :  utilisez le point d'arrachement des tenons ou  réglez le distributeur de grains en conformité aux tableaux d'épandage.\" This translates to: \"If the required height of 75 cm above the ground or crops isn't achievable with your setup, you can either adjust the number of orifices in dosing (GEOPOINT®) or set the distributeur de grains according to the tables.\"\n\nSo, putting this together, the question is about the recommended height. The context mentions that if the height isn't possible, they use either the tenons or adjust the grain distribution accordingly. It also asks whether the spreader's flow rate is correct.\n\nThe answer should be concise and precise.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what to do if a spreading disc spreads irregularly. Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see there are several bullet points about tools for detecting damage in bales or bags. The first one talks about introducing a tool like a turntable to check if an object isn't sticking or if any holes in the door or gate aren't fixed. It mentions that if the pales, disc of expansion, or bag of flowage are damaged, it's probably caused by an external object. Also, it says they should fix the damage before continuing.\n\nThe second bullet point is similar but focuses on introducing a morceau (piece) of fabric or material into the opening to prevent losing moisture during transportation. It advises against losing water while moving.\n\nLooking further down, there are two points about controlling and regulating dosing mechanisms. The first mentions controlling the machine attached behind the tractor in terms of horizontal movement. The second talks about controlling the point of entry for the gate mechanism. Both mention specific tests on pages 133 and 136 respectively.\n\nNow, the question is about a spreading disc spreading irregularly. Scanning through these points, I don't see an exact mention of a spreading disc. However, the first bullet point does talk about introducing a tool to check for damage in bales or bags, which might be related but not directly about the spreading disc.\n\nWait, maybe there's another section that mentions specific tools for checking irregular spreading. Let me look again. The context ends with some information on controlling and regulating dosing mechanisms, so perhaps the question is about a different tool.\n\nSince I don't see an exact match for a spreading disc in the provided context, but I know from experience that when bales spread unevenly, it's often due to improper handling or damage. So maybe the answer should mention using specific tools like the turntable or introducing a piece of material as per the first bullet point.\n\nBut since the question is about a spreading disc, perhaps there's an implied tool mentioned elsewhere. Alternatively, if I have to base my answer on what's provided, I might need to infer that the correct action involves checking for damage using specific tools, which would be addressed in the first bullet point.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the context does mention introducing a turntable (the first bullet) and also mentions controlling movement (second bullet). So perhaps the answer should include both actions: using the turntable to check for damage and controlling the machine's movement.\n\nBut since the question is about a spreading disc, maybe it's more about checking if the disc itself is spreading irregularly. However, in the context provided, there's no direct mention of a spreading disc. So perhaps the answer should focus on the general tool mentioned, which is introducing a turntable to check for damage.\n\nAlternatively, since the question is about a spreading disc, maybe it's referring to checking if the bale is being spread correctly by ensuring that the material flows properly and doesn't stick or have holes. But in the context, I don't see any specific mention of this.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best approach is to answer based on the information provided about tools for detecting damage, which would involve using a turntable (introducing it) and controlling movement. So the answer should include both actions.\n</think>\n\nTo address irregular spreading in a bale, use a turntable to check for damage and control the machine's horizontal movement.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

Let me check other parts of the context for any mention of the number of grease nipples.\n\nI see a section about maintenance points where it mentions \"Graisseurs\" and says you can graisser all Graisseurs with a universal type of graisse. It also refers to capacities in huile (grain) and graisse, but that's not directly related to the number of nipples.\n\nThere's another part about discharge bagues being mounted on pillars with two Graisseurs each.

Hmm, that might mean I need to infer or perhaps the user didn't include all the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to a specific entry under M6.

Since the question mentions M6, I should focus on the M6 row.\n\nLooking back, the M6 row has values like 4.8, 7, etc., but without seeing all entries, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. However, since the context doesn't provide an entry for M6 with 0.2 friction, maybe that's not part of the data given. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to assume based on the quality and friction coefficient. The user specified a 70 (A2) quality and 0.2 friction. In the context, under \"Qualité.Friction\", there are entries for M5 with different values. Maybe the M6 entry isn't present here, so I can't find an exact match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a specific torque value that's not listed in the provided context.

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if \"fine application\" is more expensive than \"normal dosing.\" Let me start by understanding what each term means in the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about dosage fin. It mentions that for normal dosing, they use a specific setup with certain parameters. The text also talks about using fine dosing as an alternative when dealing with very low or uneven parcels. \n\nIn the Dosage fin paragraph, it says that fine dosing is used for very low or extremely heterogeneous parcels by controlling the position of dosage without automation but correcting speed. It also mentions that fine dosing can be used in variable conditions under external signals using automated settings and correction of speed.\n\nSo, from this context, I see that normal dosing is standard, while fine dosing is an alternative method for specific cases. The question is about the cost difference between these two methods. \n\nI don't have explicit information comparing their costs. However, in many contexts, especially when discussing dosing methods, \"normal\" might refer to the standard or more common approach, which could be less expensive than a specialized fine application. But without specific pricing data, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nGiven that the context doesn't provide any direct comparison of costs for fine versus normal dosing, I should consider whether there's an implied cost difference based on usage. Since fine dosing is mentioned as an alternative in certain scenarios, it might be more expensive than standard normal dosing when used appropriately. But again, without explicit pricing information, this is speculative.\n\nI think the best approach here is to state that while \"normal\" dosing is standard and likely cheaper, \"fine application\" could be more expensive depending on specific circumstances. However, since the context doesn't provide a direct answer, I might have to say it's not clear from the given information whether fine application is more expensive than normal dosing.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not provide explicit cost comparison between fine application and normal dosing. However, based on usage scenarios, fine dosing may be more expensive in specific cases.\n\nAnswer: The context doesn't provide explicit cost comparison but suggests that fine dosing might be more expensive depending on circumstances.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens. Let me start by understanding what one-sided boundary spreading means. From the context provided, it seems like it's a method used in landscaping or garden maintenance where you spread plants or seeds along just one side of a boundary, maybe a fence or wall.\n\nLooking at the context, there are two main methods mentioned for one-sided boundary spreading: unilaterally spreading using a hydraulically directed blade and using ExactLine. Both involve moving from one side to another in a specific direction. \n\nNow, considering small gardens, which typically have limited space, I should think about how this method would work. One-sided spreading might be useful because it can efficiently utilize the available area without needing extensive coverage on both sides of a boundary. It could help in creating borders or separating plants without overcomplicating the layout.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider if there are any limitations. Maybe some small gardens don't have enough space for such precise directional spreading, but generally, it's possible with careful planning. The context doesn't mention any specific issues with small gardens, so I can assume that one-sided boundary spreading is suitable in many cases.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer should state that yes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens because it allows efficient use of limited space without needing extensive coverage on both sides.\n</think>\n\nYes, one-sided boundary spreading is suitable for small gardens as it efficiently utilizes limited space by focusing on a single direction.",

But since they're stopping work (i.e., not using the vehicle), maybe they don't need to prepare it yet.\n\nWait, but the question is about \"when stopping work,\" which might mean when you're no longer working on transporting the vehicle. So perhaps the measures are about ensuring that the vehicle and machine are ready for transport before starting. But I'm not entirely sure if there's anything specific in the context related to stopping work or just general preparation.\n\nI think the answer should be concise, based solely on the provided context. Since the context doesn't mention stopping work specifically, maybe it's about ensuring everything is set up correctly when you're no longer working on transporting the vehicle. So I'll list the measures from the context and see if any are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe appropriate measures for road transport should be taken when stopping work include verifying regulations, controlling systems like cables and lighting, and ensuring everything is properly prepared before starting transport.\n\nAnswer: The measures to take when stopping work on a vehicle during transport involve verifying regulations, controlling systems, and preparing the vehicle.",

                    "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why most types of fertilizer attract water. Let me start by reading through the context provided. \n\nLooking at the context, there are several points about how different fertilizers interact with water. The first sentence mentions that l'engrais humide in the bague d'écoulement has formed a block and stopped the flow because it opened the bague d'écoulement. It also notes that this can happen if the epandeur wasn't cleaned properly after use.\n\nThen, there's a general statement: \"Si les conditions sont humides, travaillez uniquement avec la bâche de trémie bien fermée.\" This translates to \"If the conditions are hydrostatic, work only with the trmier in a closed state.\"\n\nSo, putting this together, it seems that when fertilizer is used under hydrostatic conditions (meaning no significant change in water pressure), it should be kept in a closed container. If not done properly, especially if the epandeur isn't cleaned, it can form a block and stop the flow.\n\nI don't see any other information about why fertilizers attract water or how they interact with the environment. The context doesn't mention anything about the properties of the fertilizer itself or the factors that cause them to attract water. It's more about their behavior under certain conditions rather than their intrinsic attraction to water.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, I can only conclude that fertilizers are typically kept in a closed container when used under hydrostatic conditions because they form blocks and stop the flow if not properly managed.\n</think>\n\nFertilizers are usually kept in a closed container under hydrostatic conditions (no significant change in water pressure) to prevent forming blocks and stopping the flow.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are two main points mentioned about damaged vanes and their causes. The first point talks about introducing an object like a tissu piece into the discharging flow to check if it's endoded or has damage. It mentions that if pales, discharge disks, or bagues are endoded, the cause is likely a foreign object. Then it says you should fix the damage before continuing to discharge.\n\nThe second point discusses using an object in the braking flow to check for damage. It also states that if pales, discharges, or bagues are endoded, the cause is likely a foreign object. Again, fixing the damage is recommended before restarting.\n\nSo both points mention that damaged vanes are often caused by a hard object, either in the discharge flow or braking flow. The key here is that the object is causing the vane to lose its endodibility, which means it's blocking the flow and disrupting the system.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other causes mentioned elsewhere in the context. Scanning through again, there are no other points about foreign objects affecting vanes except these two. So the main cause is a hard object that disrupts the flow by endoding or causing damage to the vane structure.\n\nTherefore, the answer should clearly state that damaged vanes are most likely caused by a hard object, as both mentioned in the context.\n</think>\n\nThe damaged vanes are most likely caused by a hard object.",

That translates to \"graizez and Lubrify all parts of the machine to better preserve its integrity.\" So that's probably the paint or lubricant used after nettoyage.\n\nAdditionally, there are mentions of applying a protection liquid on the metal parts for corrosion protection.

This suggests that the curriculum includes practical skills like setting up machinery, replacing parts, and repairing issues, all conducted under experienced workers' supervision.\n\nThere are also specific details about the machine's requirements: it needs a truck with certain power levels, a device to align pieces appropriately, and communication systems. The document mentions ISO and ISOBUS systems for command and control, which indicates that technical proficiency in these areas is necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there's a section on before-propos, where the manual is addressed to farmers who have both complete training and agricultural work experience.

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nLooking at the provided context, there's a section about pictograms used in this manual. It mentions that pictograms are designed to help find certain parts of the text more easily. The words \" Conseil\" and \"Indication\" are followed by specific instructions or tips for using the machine. \n\nI see that under the \"Signification des symboles\" section, there's a part that says: \"Les pictogrammes utilisés sont destinés à vous aider à trouver facilement certaines parties du texte.\" This translates to \"The pictograms used are designed to help you find easily certain parts of the text.\"\n\nThen, it goes on to mention that these instructions include serious dysfonctionnements (which I think means serious malfunctions), endommagement (destruction), dommages corporels or accidents. It also notes that the key plate has recommendations or adjustments.\n\nThe next part talks about security standards: \"La clé plate annonce des conseils de montage ou de réglage.\" This translates to \"The key plate provides recommendations or adjustments.\"\n\nThen, it lists several sections with specific instructions:\n- 5: Sécurité\n- 6: [Image]\n- 7: [Image]\n\nEach of these sections has a command like \"Ne prenez pas le risque de vous blesser gravement ou mortellement simplement parce que vous avez négligé les consignes de sécurité.\" This means that each section instructs caution about not making mistakes because they didn't follow the security standards.\n\nPutting it all together, the pictograms are specified for agricultural machinery under an international standard. The key part is \"Les pictogrammes utilisés sont destinés à vous aider à trouver facilement certaines parties du texte.\" This directly states that the pictograms are used to help find specific parts of the text, which relates to agricultural machinery's security standards.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the pictograms are specified under an international standard related to agricultural machinery's security. The exact term is \"International Standard,\" but since it's about the pictograms' use for agricultural machinery, I think the primary standard here is likely the \"International Standard\" or more specifically, perhaps \"International Standard for Agricultural Machinery.\" However, looking back at the context, the main point is that the pictograms are used to help find parts of the text, which relates to security standards. \n\nWait, actually, in the context, it's about the pictograms being used for agricultural machinery, so maybe the standard is \"International Standard\" or perhaps a specific one like \"International Standard for Agricultural Machinery.\" But since the question is asking by which international standard they are specified, and given that the context mentions security standards, I think the answer should be \"International Standard\" as it's a general term applicable to many fields.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more precise to say \"International Standard for Agricultural Machinery,\" but without specific knowledge of what the exact standard is, it's safer to go with the broadest term. However, in the context provided, the main point is about security standards, so perhaps the answer should be that they are specified under an international standard related to agricultural machinery's security.\n\nWait, looking again at the context, the section mentions \"Les pictogrammes utilisés sont destinés à vous aider à trouver facilement certaines parties du texte.\" This translates to \"The pictograms used are designed to help you find easily certain parts of the text.\" So it's about how they're used for agricultural machinery. Therefore, the standard is likely an international one that specifies their use in agricultural machinery.\n\nBut since the question is asking by which international standard they are specified, and given that the context doesn't specify a particular standard beyond security, I think the answer should be \"International Standard\" as it's a general term applicable to many fields. However, if we consider the specific part about agricultural machinery, perhaps it's better to say \"International Standard for Agricultural Machinery.\" But without knowing the exact standard name, it's safer to go with the broadest term.\n\nWait, actually, in the context, under the \"Sécurité\" section, there are multiple sections each with a command. The key part is that these instructions include security standards. So perhaps the answer should be that they're specified under an international standard related to agricultural machinery's security, but again, without knowing the exact term, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is simply \"International Standard\" as it's a general term used in many contexts. But I think more accurately, since the context mentions security standards, the answer should be that they're specified under an international standard related to agricultural machinery's security, but again, without knowing the exact term, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to look for the specific instruction: \"Les pictogrammes utilisés sont destinés à vous aider à trouver",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that the context mentions several systems related to the ISO bus protocol. The main ones are the ISO command system, the automatic weighing system, and the ISO-BUS system itself. Each of these has specific features and capabilities.\n\nLooking at the first part: \"Système de commande ISO\" refers to the ISO command system. It says it's compatible with tractors equipped with an ISOBUS connection. The description mentions that if a tractor doesn't have an ISOBUS connection, the concessionnaire (which I assume is the tool or accessory) can provide the IsoMatch Tellus terminal over which all machines will branch.\n\nNext, \"Système de pesée automatique\" refers to the automatic weighing system. It also says it's compatible with tractors that have an ISOBUS connection and mentions that if there's no connection, the tool can provide the IsoMatch Tellus terminal for connecting all machines via USB.\n\nThen, the last part is about \"Le système de commande ISO,\" which I think refers to the ISO command system. It further explains that it uses the ISOBUS protocol and is compatible with tractors that have an ISOBUS connection. If a tractor doesn't have one, the tool can provide the IsoMatch Tellus terminal for connecting all machines via USB.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about different ISOBUS communication protocol versions compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system. So I need to identify each version and their specifications.\n\nFrom what's written, there are two main systems: ISO command system and automatic weighing system. Both use the ISOBUS protocol. The tool (concessionnaire) can provide the IsoMatch Tellus terminal for connecting machines via either an ISOBUS connection or USB if no connection is present.\n\nSo, the technical specifications would include:\n\n1. **ISO Command System**:\n   - Uses ISOBUS protocol.\n   - Compatible with tractors having an ISOBUS connection.\n   - If a tractor doesn't have an ISOBUS connection, the tool can provide the IsoMatch Tellus terminal via USB for connecting machines.\n\n2. **Automatic Weighing System**:\n   - Also uses ISOBUS protocol.\n   - Compatible with tractors equipped with an ISOBUS connection.\n   - If no ISOBUS connection is present, the tool can provide the IsoMatch Tellus terminal via USB to connect all machines.\n\nI don't see any other specific versions mentioned beyond these two. The bandwidth capabilities aren't explicitly stated in the context provided. Therefore, I might need to infer or check if there's more detail about bandwidths elsewhere.\n\nSince the question is about ISOBUS compatible with IsoMatch Tellus, and both systems use the same protocol, they likely have similar bandwidth specifications. However, without explicit information on bandwidth capabilities, it's challenging to provide precise details. If I had to answer based solely on the given context, I might not be able to specify exact bandwidths.\n\nBut perhaps the question is more about identifying that both systems are using ISOBUS and compatible with tractors having either an ISOBUS connection or USB. So, in terms of technical specifications, they would have features like command execution, weight measurement, etc., all tied to the ISOBUS protocol.\n\nIn summary, I think the key points are:\n\n- Both systems use the ISOBUS protocol.\n- They are compatible with tractors having an ISOBUS connection.\n- If a tractor doesn't have an ISOBUS connection, the tool can provide the IsoMatch Tellus terminal via USB for connecting machines.\n</think>\n\nThe technical specifications and bandwidth capabilities of the ISOBUS communication protocols compatible with the IsoMatch Tellus system include:\n\n1. **ISO Command System**:\n   - Uses the ISOBUS protocol.\n   - Compatible with tractors equipped with an ISOBUS connection.\n\n2. **Automatic Weighing System**:\n   - Also uses the ISOBUS protocol.\n   - Compatible with tractors equipped with an ISOBUS connection.\n\nBoth systems are designed to work with tractors that have either an ISOBUS connection or a USB connection, allowing them to communicate and function effectively without requiring both.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nThe context mentions that if your tracteur (which I think is the tractor) has an ISOBUS connection, you only need a single cable with a ratcheter to connect it to IsoMatch Tellus. They provide a standard ISO 11786 cable for this purpose. \n\nLooking further down, there's information about the compactness and functionality of IsoMatch Tellus GO. It says that besides its reduced size compared to double screens, it's very compact and doesn't have WLAN/WIFI support. This is important because if you're using a standard cable, maybe it's not compatible with other systems.\n\nThe context also talks about adapting non-ISOBUS tractors using the IsoMatch Power ratcheter. It mentions that without the ISO bus connection, certain functions can be activated accidentally in dangerous zones and that the boîtier consumes current to charge its battery. However, when left on with the engine off, I don't see any specific information about battery flattening.\n\nWait, but the question is about how long it would operate before flattening the battery if left switched on with the engine off. The context doesn't mention anything about engines or battery flatness in that scenario. It only talks about using the ISO bus for connections and adapting tractors without it.\n\nSo, based on what's provided, there's no information about how long IsoMatch Tellus can operate continuously before a typical tractor battery flattens when left switched on with the engine off.

The first part talks about regular graissing of transmission tubes. It mentions that enduising (which I think means applying graisse) should be done on surfaces where resistance is detected during attachment or disassembly, and at least once per season.\n\nThen it lists some actions like detaching the transmission, separating it, endinguing the surface of inner tube, etc., all with specific instructions. There's a reference to \"Cf. »Capacités en huile et en graisse« on page 124 and \"Intervalles de maintenance« on page 125.\n\nThe context also mentions that the coefficient of friction is recommended for certain materials like plaque huilée, fonte, surface trempée, etc., with a higher value (0.13) for sèche materials. For boulons and ecrous tubes with base dentelées, 10% more tensile or whizlock is needed.\n\nThe exceptions are mentioned in the manual on pages 129, but I don't see any specific mention of greasing profiled tubes here. The main focus seems to be on regular graissing and coefficient of friction for different materials.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n- Graisse must be regularly applied.\n- For certain materials (plaque huilée, fonte, etc.), use 0.10 coefficient.\n- For others (sèche), use 0.13.\n- Exceptions require additional tensile or whizlock.\n\nSince the question is about the specific grease type for profiled tubes, and the context doesn't mention greasing specifically, but mentions applying graisse regularly, I think the answer should be that graisse is used, with the coefficient of friction as per the materials. However, since the user asked for a precise answer based on the given context, and there's no direct mention of a specific grease type beyond graisse, maybe the answer is that graisse is recommended, but perhaps more accurately, it's about applying the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, looking back at the instructions, the user wants the specific 'grease' type. The context doesn't specify any particular grease type except for the coefficient of friction. So, I think the answer should be that graisse (grease) is used with the specified coefficients based on material type.\n</think>\n\nThe specific grease type recommended for profiled tubes on the coupling shaft is graisse (grease), which is applied with a coefficient of friction as per the materials' properties: 0.10 for certain plaque huilée, fonte, etc., and 0.13 for sèche materials.

RS-232 is a standard for serial communication, used in many industrial and computer applications.\n\nI remember that serial communication uses a clock signal to synchronize data transmission. The clock speed determines the baud rate because it's the number of pulses per second. So, if the clock speed is 80 MHz, then the baud rate would be 80 times higher than the clock frequency. That makes sense because each pulse represents one bit or character.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact minimum baud rate. Maybe there are specific standards or minimum requirements for RS-232 connections? I think some protocols might require a certain minimum speed to ensure data integrity or proper communication. However, without more context, it's hard to pin down an exact number.\n\nI should consider common clock frequencies used in serial communications. 80 MHz is a standard starting point because it's high enough for many applications. If the connection needs higher speeds, they might use 160 MHz or even higher. But if there's a specific requirement, like minimal speed to avoid errors, maybe 40 MHz? That seems too low; I don't think that's typical.\n\nAlso, sometimes manufacturers provide minimum clock rates for certain protocols. For RS-232, the minimum might be around 80 MHz because it's a standard and widely supported frequency. So, unless there's a specific reason to go lower than that, 80 MHz is probably the minimum baud rate they're referring to.\n\nI should also think about whether this applies across different devices or if it's specific to certain systems. Since RS-232 connections are common in many environments, using 80 MHz as the minimum makes sense for general use without overcomplicating things.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I believe the minimum baud rate for an RS-232 connection is typically around 80 MHz.\n</think>\n\nThe minimum baud rate for an RS-232 connection is generally 80 MHz.",

The image shows a procedure with steps like mounting the batten on the machine, attaching the deflector at the base, and consulting instructions for the montage.

The image shows a deflector attached to the base of the support. It's separated by pulling the attachment piece to the right and then disassembling the deflector. This suggests that the tap is made from materials used in this process—probably metal or plastic because they're common for such components.\n\nLooking at other parts, there are mentions of lamellar sets and indicators like \"Avant la première utilisation\" which refers to when the first use occurs.

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see a section labeled 8 with \"Bandes d'épan- dage visibles dans la végéta- tion\" which translates to visible bands in vegetation. It mentions that when working in bad weather conditions like bad weather or bad coverage of nappes de panache, certain things happen. \n\nLooking further down, there's a bullet point under 8: \"Travail dans de mauvaises conditions météorologiques : humidité de l'air élevée, pluie, chaleur ou vitesses élevées du vent (>5m/s)\". This part talks about bad weather conditions and mentions wind speeds greater than 5 m/s. \n\nThen there's another bullet point under 9: \"Mauvais recouvrement des nappes d'épan- dage\" which refers to poor coverage of nappes de panache, followed by a bullet point that says \"Tracez à chaque fois des ornières avant de procéder à l'épandage\". This part advises against epandering unless there's good coverage.\n\nThe next section under 9 is about bad weather conditions again: \"NUtilisez pas d'épandeur lorsqu'il pleut ou que l'humidité atmosphérique est élevée. L'engrais resterait alors collé aux bacs de collecte, ce qui aurait pour conséquence l'obtention d'une nappe d'épandage irrégulière.\" This part says not to epander unless it's good coverage and advises against epandering when it rains or the air is humid.\n\nThen there's a bullet point under 7: \"Ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitces supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" This specifically mentions not proceeding with epandering if the wind speed exceeds 3 m/s, which is equivalent to a force of 2.\n\nPutting this all together, the key point is that when the wind speed is greater than 5 m/s, it's bad weather. But there's also a specific limit mentioned: \"Ne procédez pas à l'épandage lorsque le vent souffle à des vitces supérieures à 3 m/s (force du vent 2).\" So the exact limit before epandering becomes unacceptable is when wind speed exceeds 5 m/s, but there's an exception where if it's over 3 m/s, you shouldn't epander.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the bullet points under 8 and 9, both mention wind speeds greater than 5 m/s. The one under 7 specifically says \"vitesse du vent (> 3 m/s)\", which is a bit different from the others. So the main limit before epandering becomes unacceptable is when wind speed exceeds 5 m/s, but there's an exception where if it's over 3 m/s, you shouldn't epander.\n\nSo the answer should mention that the typical wind speed limit before spreading quality becomes unacceptable is greater than 5 m/s, with a specific exception for higher speeds. But since the question asks for the typical limit, I think it's referring to 5 m/s as the threshold.\n</think>\n\nThe typical wind speed limit before spreading quality becomes unacceptable is greater than 5 meters per second.\n\nANSWER: >5 m/s",

So that's a key point about the limit.\n\nThen there's another part: \"Les véhicules à moteur à vitesse limitée (< 40 km/h), les tracteurs agricoles et forestiers ainsi que leurs remorques et machines tractées doivent être équipés à l'arrière d'un triangle orange réfléchissant bordé de rouge et à pointes coupées.\" This means that vehicles with a motor at a limited speed (<40 km/h) and tractors, farmers, etc., must be equipped with tires fitted into an orange triangle that's red on the back edge and has black points. The color coding suggests it's for identification purposes.\n\nNext, there are several control steps mentioned: \"Réglez toutes les pièces de la machine et du tracteur, notamment la prise de force, le système hydraulique, pneumatique et électrique, en position de transport.\" This translates to regulating all parts of the machine and tractor, especially force, hydraulics, pneumatic systems, and electric systems in transport mode.\n\n\"Contrôlez la répartition du poids entre l'essieu avant et arrière.\" That means controlling the weight distribution between front and rear axles.\n\n\"Fixez éventuellement des masses frontales.\" This indicates fixing any front masses.\n\n\"Vérifiez la hauteur maximale de l'ensemble.\" So verifying the maximum height of the entire set.\n\n\"Abaissez éventuellement le dispositif de levage.\" To lower the guide device possibly.\n\n\"Verrouillez le poste de commande du dispositif de levage lorsque vous roulez, de sorte à ce que la machine portée ne puisse s'abaisser involontairement.\" So ensuring that when you're moving, the guide device is lowered to prevent the machine from descending involuntarily.\n\nFinally, \"Sécurité\" and \"Transport\" are mentioned. The image reference is also present.\n\nPutting this together, the key points related to tire pressure for transport mode are: not exceeding 210 bars, equipped with specific tires in orange triangles, and certain control steps regarding weight distribution, mass fixing, height verification, and guide device lowering.\n\nThe question asks for the recommended tire pressure range. The most direct information is that it shouldn't exceed 210 bars. So the answer should be \"210 bars\" as the maximum limit.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended tire pressure range for transport mode is not exceeding 210 bars.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are two situations mentioned: one from epandage à partir des voies de pulvérisation and another from epandage unilatéral en bordure avec déflecteur de bordure. Both seem to be about epandage, which is spreading or expansion in parcelle.\n\nLooking at the first situation under epandage à partir des voies de pulvérisation, there are several steps outlined. The key part here is that during border spreading, the driving speed reduction percentage mentioned is 75%. So that's a specific number they want me to extract.\n\nThe second situation under epandage unilatéral en bordure avec déflecteur de bordure talks about reducing the driving speed by 25% when selecting a report for routing at the same speed as normal or if the bed rate is reduced. But this seems more related to another aspect of border spreading, perhaps not directly applicable here.\n\nSince the question specifically asks about the optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate, I focus on the first situation. The 75% reduction in speed is clearly stated there as part of the procedure steps.\n\nI don't see any other mentions of a 25% or another percentage mentioned in this context. So, the answer should be 75%.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal driving speed reduction percentage during border spreading to compensate for application rate is 75%.\n\n[Carefully extract the EXACT information that directly answers the question, keeping it as brief and precise as possible]",

The first step says, \"Effectuez un premier passage avec le centre du tracteur sur environ 2 mètres à partir de la bordure de parcelle.\" That translates to driving the first path with the center of the tractor about 2 meters from the edge of a parcel. So that's giving the distance as 2 meters.\n\nThen, there are other steps like \"Raccordez à nouveau l'entraînement du disque d'épandage droit.\" and \"Retirez le déflecteur de bordure après le premier passage ou relevez le déflecteur hydraulique.\" These seem to be about adjusting the setup before starting the border spreading process.\n\nThe key information here is that the first passage is done at 2 meters from the field edge.

Under \"Support pour les connecteurs électriques et les flexibles hydrauliques,\" it outlines steps to ensure the support can handle lifting and movement. It mentions placing an epandeur on a stable, solid surface like a palette, moving the tracteur (machine) forward by about 200 mm, disconnecting the motor, disconnecting the contacts, discharging the electric connections onto the support, removing hydraulics, attaching protection bouchons to flexible hydraulics, and then disconnecting the coupling arm from the bracket.\n\nThe text also states that if the machine is equipped with roues of stationery, you should move it to the desired storage location and position the cales (cales) in front of the roues.

So I'm looking for something that comes before winter preparation but still helps with the machine's performance during spring.\n\nLooking back, the first paragraph under \"CONSEIL\" lists graizing, nettoyer, then regraize again.

The text doesn't explicitly mention plastic, but since the other parts are made from metal, maybe the plastic seal is a different part that's used in conjunction with metal components.\n\nLooking back at the maintenance steps, I don't see any direct mention of a plastic seal. However, considering the context provided, it seems like the agitator axle seal might be constructed using metal parts, and perhaps there are specific materials listed for each component. Since the question is about the 'plastic seal' material specification, maybe the plastic part isn't explicitly detailed in this section.\n\nWait, but the user's question is about the plastic seal specifically. In the maintenance steps, I don't see any mention of a plastic seal being used or specified. The focus seems to be on metal parts like bags and agitator arm control. So perhaps the plastic seal isn't part of this particular context provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in another section not shown here, there's information about the plastic seal material. Since I don't have access to that, I can only infer based on the given context. The most precise answer would be that the plastic seal is not specified within the provided text, so it might be unknown or not found in context.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The maintenance steps mention bags of metal, agitator arm control, and gauging thickness. There's no mention of a plastic seal here. So unless there's more information elsewhere, I can't provide an exact specification for the plastic seal based on this context.\n</think>\n\nThe plastic seal material specification is not provided in the given context.\n\nAnswer: The plastic seal material specification is not specified within the provided context.",

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections about maintenance steps related to agiters. The key part seems to be under \"Maintenance\" where they mention removing bales and bagging them. There's a line: \"Retire les 3 boulons de fixation des bagues d'étanchéité.\" That translates to removing three bags of fixated bales.\n\nThen, there are instructions about placing the bags back on the axles. The text says, \"Placez à nouveau les bagues d'étanchéité métalliques.\" So they're reinserting metal bales into the agitator. \n\nThe context also mentions that these metal bales are sealed with graisseurs (grape-sealants). It goes on to say, \"Les bales d'écoulement sont montées sur paliers, fixées à l'arbre de l'agitateur et pourvues de 2 graisseurs.\" This means the bags of flow are attached to the axles with two grape-sealants.\n\nThe question is about the material of these metal seal rings. From the text, it seems that the metal bales themselves are being sealed. The mention of \"grape-sealants\" suggests they're using a specific type of sealant. However, the exact material isn't explicitly stated in the provided context. It's possible that the material is not listed here or might be inferred from standard agitator sealings.\n\nSince the question asks for the material and the given text doesn't specify it, I should consider if there's any other information. The only direct mention of metal bales being sealed is through grape-sealants, so maybe the material isn't explicitly mentioned but is implied to be metal or a type of metal-based sealant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the agitator uses a specific metal alloy for these seals. But without explicit information in the context, I can only rely on what's stated. The text doesn't provide the material name, so it might be that the answer is not found in the provided context or requires more detailed knowledge beyond what's given.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I should state that the exact material isn't specified and advise consulting additional sources if needed.\n</think>\n\nThe exact material of the 'metal seal rings' for agitator axle seal isn't explicitly stated in the provided context.

The key elements mentioned are \"Câble de rallonge ISO,\" which I think stands for extension cable, and it's part of the ISO 11786 standard. There's also a mention of \"Câble RS232\" with a length of 144.\n\nThe question is asking about the optimal extension cable length in meters for ISO 11786. From the context, I see that after mentioning the racking ISO 11786 in the cabine, there's an instruction to place the câble de raccordement \"IsoMatch Tellus\" directly on a radar or wheel connection. The length of this cable is specified as 144.\n\nI should focus on the part where it says \"Juste après le câble de raccordement ISO 11786 dans la cabine, 0 1.\" This indicates that after placing the cable in place, there are two numbers: 0 and 1.

The key part here is where it mentions the test manual and tests. Specifically, under \"INDICATION,\" there's a line that says \"Test manuel d'étalonnage du débit 71 71.\" That seems to indicate a test manual for flow rate testing.\n\nThen, later on, there are some entries like \"GEOCONTROL  102, 104\" and \"GEOCONTROL  102, 104\" again. These probably refer to the version or specific features of the software. The line \"Reprise de ligne avec la fonction  GEOCONTROL       100\" mentions that the test period is 100 days.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the duration is 100 days or something else.

Let me start by reading through the context provided.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about a machine equipped with a reference camera to reduce wear from usage conditions like derriving or tunneling. It mentions that the system corrects measurement factors using the camera signal and adjusts an engine motor or freeriding due to vibrations in the measured value. \n\nThen, it talks about when the trimer content reaches 100 kg, the command system cuts the automatic setting. The precision of the measurement decreases significantly if a new automatic setting isn't able to establish a better flow curve.\n\nThere's also information about systems that can reduce the minimum trimer content for the automatic setting down from 50 kg/ha to 15 kg per hectare, depending on hopper empty sensor data. \n\nThe context includes a test manual for the valve set with a hopper empty sensor. It mentions that when the container is rinched in, it significantly improves precision. All points within the container where grains or other materials are added are now filled.\n\nSo, focusing on the part about the hopper and the automatic setting: the system can adjust the minimum trimer content based on hopper empty sensor data. This suggests that the valve set used here is designed to work with a hopper that has an empty sensor. \n\nI don't see any specific valve type or manufacturer mentioned in this context, but perhaps it's referring to a standard valve set commonly used for such applications. However, without more specific information from the context, I can only conclude based on the given data.\n\nWait, maybe the context is part of a larger document where specific valve types and manufacturers are listed. Since the user provided a question about the valve set with a hopper empty sensor, perhaps it's referring to a standard model like the 100 kg/h set or similar.

If that's the case, then the answer would include the type and manufacturer as per the manual.

Then it mentions a piece of coin with protection and images showing that. \n\nNext, under \"Bâche,\" it describes how the bâche (which I think is the hopper cover) protects things from water and dust. It says the bâche is placed on the trémie or re hausse and keeps what's inside dry and protected from rain and leaks.\n\nThen there are sections about the bâche being used for epandage, which I believe is filling material like pellets. It mentions that the bâche can be used to fill pellets and also discusses electrical components. The section on \"Bâche électrique\" specifically talks about using the electric version of the bâche, which includes parts like 2 long sides, 2 short sides, 4 coin pieces, 4 protection pieces, and fixes.\n\nThe part about UV resistance is under \"Calcul de la charge par essieu pour les machines portées,\" which I think refers to calculating the load for machines carried.
